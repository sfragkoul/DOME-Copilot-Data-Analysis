# Publication Figures and Analysis

This directory serves as the workspace for generating the final figures and analytical plots used in the associated research publication.

## Notebooks

- **`Graph_Panel_3_Analysis.ipynb`**: The primary notebook for generating "Panel 3" of the publication figures. It likely contains code for visualizing dataset statistics, evaluation metrics, or comparative analysis between different model versions or human baselines.

## Usage

These notebooks are designed to produce publication-quality vector graphics (SVG/PDF). They rely on the data found in the `Copilot_Processed_Datasets_JSON` and `DOME_Registry_Human_Reviews_258_20260205.json` files.
