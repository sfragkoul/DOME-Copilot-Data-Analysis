Phylogenetic imputation uses maximum likelihood (we will not abbreviate maximum likelihood as ML to avoid confusion with machine learning), assuming Brownian Motion to predict missing phenotypes using a phylogenetic tree, assuming more closely related species or sequences have more similar phenotypes. We randomly removed 50 opsin sequences, and their corresponding \u03bbmax values from each of the training datasets used to train our ML models (with the exception of the smaller MWS/LWS and invertebrate datasets, in which we only removed 15), then estimated the removed \u03bbmax values using phylogenetic imputation.

We used naming conventions that include versioning to improve reproducibility and reliability of individual datasets and models. For example, one subset combines ultraviolet and SWS opsins, which we named VPOD_uss_het_1.0. Our convention is to name the subset (in this case USS = \u2018Ultraviolet and Short-wave Sensitive\u2019 opsins); name the source of phenotype data (heterologous = het), and record the version number of the dataset (1.0). We also created subsets for medium- and long-wave sensitive opsins (VPOD_mls_het_1.0) and all rod (Rh1) and rod-like (Rh2) opsins (VPOD_rod_het_1.0). Other subsets use species taxonomy, one for vertebrates (VPOD_vert_het_1.0) and another for invertebrates (VPOD_inv_het_1.0). For taxonomic subsets, we considered all sequences from phylum Chordata as \u2018vertebrates\u2019 and the rest as 'invertebrates\u2019. Another subset excludes all mutant opsin sequences, called \u2018wild-types\u2019 (VPOD_wt_het_1.0). A final named subset is the whole data set (VPOD_wds_het_1.0). \nUsing various subsets of data, we performed a number of experiments to better understand the performance of ML models in predicting \u03bbmax. First, to better understand how training data relate to model performance, R2 , and training data size, we gradually increased the size of training datasets, using the WDS, Vertebrate, WT, and Rod subsets separately, by adding between 15-50 randomly selected sequences at a time, repeating the process three times per data split (Table S1). We then analyzed the fit between the size of training data sets (x-axis) and model performance (y-axis), comparing six non-linear models with AIC to find the model that best explains the observed variation (Figure S2). Second, to understand if ML could predict known phenotypic changes due to experimental mutations, we queried the top performing WT model (which lacks data from artificially mutated sequences) using all experimentally mutated opsins to predict their phenotypes. We plotted these results using matplotlib [49] to visualize characteristics of poorly predicted outliers (e.g., taxonomic bias or sensitivity to mutations which caused large shifts in \u03bbmax from the WT). Third, we examined the ability of our models to predict \u03bbmax of thirty invertebrate opsins not in VPOD_1.0 because they are only known from physiological studies (Table S3, Figure S4). Here, we collected data both characterized by single-cell microspectrophotometry (MSP) or electroretinogram methods and with expression localized to cell-type by in-situ-hybridization (ISH), to link \u03bbmax to a specific opsin (the sequences and metadata can be found in \u2018msp_erg_raw.txt\u2019 and \u2018msp_erg_meta.tsv\u2019, while the resulting predictions can be found under the \u2018msp_tests\u2019 folder on our GitHub repository). Finally, we directly compared predictive capabilities of models trained on different data subsets by randomly selecting and removing the same 25 wild-type ultraviolet or short-wave sensitive opsins from the training data of the WDS, Vertebrate, WT, and UVS/SWS models before training and querying the model with those same sequences following training (Table S3, Figure S5). \"\n",

One consequence of this encoding is any amino acids at a given position in the alignment, which are not present at that position in any training data, will be treated equivalently as unseen. For example, cases of only A and V at a highly conserved site in the training set that are presented with a sequence with T at that site will be considered as no A and no V. The models cannot distinguish the input whether it's T or other unseen amino acids at that site.  ",

Those features where the p-value of their test against the phenotype is less than a threshold (default p-value = 0.25) will be dropped. A list of all features and their test p-values are provided a report to the user.

Currently, methods used for MOB typing annotation rely on relaxase-based approaches such as MOB-suite and MOBscan. However, in metagenomic plasmid assembly fragments, relaxase sequences are often missing or incomplete. As a result, most plasmid assembly fragments are annotated as non-transferable plasmids. Due to differences in sequence features and host range among different MOB types, this study utilized the Skip-gram language model to digitally encode the biological patterns and features of metagenomic plasmid assembly fragments, resulting in significant performance improvements for MOBFinder. With a training dataset of up to 990,000 entries, Random Forest was used to prevent overfitting in training the MOB classification models. The combined use of these two algorithms effectively enhanced the performance of predicting MOB types in metagenomic plasmid assembly fragments.

Additionally, we ensure that the novel test set significantly differs from the training set in terms of protein sequences. Therefore, among the remaining 90% annotated proteins, those lacking significant alignments (E-value>1e-3) to the test set were assigned to the training set, while others were assigned to the validation set.

The novelty of this algorithm lies in its utilization of cutting-edge deep learning techniques, such as Transformers and ESM2 embeddings, to enhance prediction accuracy and efficiency. This new approach was chosen over more traditional models due to its higher specificity and sensitivity in identifying immunogenic epitopes and novel epitopes. Moreover, by merging all epitopes into a single positive sample class and using negative samples in a 1:1 ratio during training, this method learns unified epitope features, enabling better differentiation between epitopes and regular peptide sequences. This not only improves prediction accuracy but also significantly reduces the need for chemical experiments, lowering costs, and demonstrating greater robustness and reliability in antigen selection tasks across diverse populations.",

      "encoding": "A preprocessed version of the Human Connectome Project's (HCP) Young Adults dataset was used. While a comprehensive and detailed description has been published elsewhere [1], a concise description of the steps involved is as follows: In a first step, correction for distortions related to gradient nonlinearity (which is more pronounced in the HCP\u2019s scanner setup) was applied with a FreeSurfer software package. The FSL software\u2019s FLIRT method was then used to correct for head motion. Grand-mean intensity normalization was performed on the fMRI time series. One of the keystones of fMRI studies is reliable intersubject comparability, which requires translating a subject\u2019s physical space into a common standard space (\u201dregistering\u201d). The HCP addressed this fundamental issue via multimodal registering, i.e. using a variety of imaging modalities to reliably and automati- cally identify anatomical or functional landmarks in each subject\u2019s 3D data and align them accordingly in what they call grayordi- nate space, a derivate of Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, in which only matter of interest (i.e. gray matter) is preserved. Building on work described in [2], Glasser et al. [3] developed a multi-modal and mapped areal-feature-based (dubbed \u201dMSMAll\u201d) registration method, which uses myelin maps, resting-state brain networks, visuotopic maps, and a subcortical region of interest for inter-subject alignment (see the supplemental methods of [3] for implementation details).  The analysis is a parcellated analysis. For the cerebral cortex, HCP-MMP1.0 (Human Connectome Project Multi- Modal Parcellation version 1.0, [3]) by Glasser et al. was used. They delineated 180 parcels per hemisphere (360 in total) by using the overlap of four areal feature maps, one for each modality (cortical thickness, relative myelin content, tfMRI, rsfMRI). Subcortical parcels were provided by Tian et al. [4]. They relied on subcortical-to-cortical connectivity derived from the HCP\u2019s rsfMRI data to delineate 27 subcortical parcels per hemisphere (54 in total) along connectivity gradients, i.e. sufficiently stark changes in func tional connectivity. Finally, cerebellar parcels came from a HCP-based study which clustered neighboring cerebellar voxels into 100 parcels by means of similarity of their rsfMRI time-series [5].

For each ground truth nucleus, predictions within a 15 pixel (3.3 \u03bcm) were identified. This radius is smaller than the average size of lymphocytes, which form the smallest nuclei in the dataset. Matching was performed based on the highest predictive score (if available) or the shortest distance. After matching, the ground truth was censored until all ground truth nuclei were either matched or classified as a false negative. Using the identified true positives, false positives, and false negatives, precision (all correct predictions divided by all predictions) and recall (all correct predictions divided by all ground truth nuclei) were calculated. The class F1 score was computed as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, ranging from 0 to 1. Finally to compare models, micro F1  (aggregation of TP, FP, and FN over all classes, followed by F1 score calculation) and Average F1  (the average of class F1 scores) were calculated [40]. Results are shown with a 95% confidence interval which is calculated through bootstrapping the samples. \n\nBoth models and intra- and interobserver agreement were evaluated using the DICE score. The DICE score is a harmonic mean between 0 and 1, in which 1 is a perfect segmentation prediction, and 0 is no correct prediction. This can result in inflated high average DICE scores if a tissue class is only present in a few samples, as the DICE score is 1 in the case of a correct absent prediction. To accommodate this, we calculated not only the average DICE score over all samples but also the micro average DICE. This is the DICE score for all predictions concatenated along one axis, resulting in a prediction mask of 1024 \u00d7 96.256 pixels. Results are shown with a 95% confidence interval which is generated through bootstrapping the sample results. \n\nMetrics are in line with literature (Maier-Hein, L., Reinke, A., Godau, P. et al.

Additionally, these algorithms can be applied to whole slide images instead of tiles. \n\nFor tissue annotation semantic segmentation, two models were used.

To reduce overfitting risk, we applied multiple strategies: dropout layers were used throughout the model (including attention and expert modules), early layers were regularized, and 5-fold cross-validation was used for evaluation. Additionally, no test data was used during training, and performance was monitored across folds to ensure consistency. The model showed stable generalization across folds, indicating overfitting was effectively controlled.",
      "meta": "No, the model does not use the outputs of other machine learning algorithms as input. All predictions are directly generated from the original input features (node attributes and edge structure) within a unified end-to-end architecture. There is no meta-predictor stage, and no stacking or ensembling of separate models was performed. The 5-fold cross-validation ensures strict separation between training and test data.",
      "parameters": "The model has approximately 1.2 to 2.0 million trainable parameters, depending on the chosen hidden dimensions, number of experts, and expert layer size. The total parameter count includes the HAN encoder, expert networks, gating layers, and attention modules. The values of hyperparameters (e.g., hidden_dim, expert_dim, num_experts, num_heads) were manually selected based on validation performance using 5-fold cross-validation. No exhaustive grid search was conducted; instead, we evaluated a small set of reasonable configurations based on prior work and model capacity considerations.",
      "regularization": "Yes, multiple regularization techniques were applied to prevent overfitting. Dropout layers were used in both the expert networks and attention modules. L2 regularization was applied implicitly via the optimizer. Additionally, the model\u2019s multi-task structure (MMoE) encourages parameter sharing and reduces the risk of overfitting to any single RNA type. While early stopping was not explicitly applied, 5-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate generalization, and no test data was used during training.",

      "provenance": "The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was obtained from publicly available databases such as STRING (source of string_net.txt), which is widely recognized and used in bioinformatics research. Node features were generated by performing PCA on a processed TCGA gene expression dataset (cancer_full_expression_pc50.csv) that was compiled and curated by previous studies from the TCGA public resource. Class labels indicating essential (positive) and non-essential (negative) genes were obtained from a summary file from DepMap, a widely used database. The dataset includes 2,299 essential genes (Npos) and 10,723 non-essential genes (Nneg). It is designed for classification tasks and does not contain real-valued outputs for regression. While the cancer_full_expression_pc50.csv feature file was generated in this study, it is from direct transformation of TCGA expression matrix, which is widely used in the cancer research community.",
      "redundancy": "The dataset was split using stratified 5-fold cross-validation to ensure independence between training and test sets in each fold. Specifically, genes were partitioned so that no gene appeared in both training and test sets within the same fold, thus maintaining non-overlapping sets. Similar to our approach, other gene classification methods such as EMOGI and MTGCN (both used as benchmark methods in this study) also employ cross-validation strategies to split data into training and test sets. Cross-validation provides a robust framework for performance evaluation by ensuring that each sample is tested while maintaining independence between training and testing data within each fold. This approach is widely used in the community for gene-level prediction tasks, especially when datasets are limited in size or exhibit class imbalance. Therefore, our use of stratified cross-validation aligns with established practices in similar studies.",
      "splits": "We employed a stratified 5-fold cross-validation strategy to evaluate model performance. 80% of the data were allocated for training and 20% for testing. Within the training subset, 90% was used for final training and 10% for validation, which was utilized for model tuning and early stopping. Although the original label data consist of 2,299 essential genes (Npos) and 10,723 non-essential genes (Nneg), the actual number of genes involved in training varies depending on the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, as not all genes are present in every network. For instance, in the STRING network, only a subset of genes is retained after filtering based on network inclusion.\n\nGiven that non-essential genes outnumber essential genes by more than fourfold, and that the number of available genes varies across networks, direct training would suffer from a class imbalance problem, potentially resulting in poor predictive performance on the minority (essential) class. To mitigate this, we adopted a resampling strategy whereby, for each training, validation, and test split, all essential genes were included alongside randomly selected non-essential genes at a 1:4 ratio. Using the STRING network as an example, this procedure yielded 6,048 genes in the training set, 972 in the validation set, and 1,680 in the test set. Because the splits were dynamically generated in each fold, we did not plot the distributions explicitly, but the stratification process guarantees that the class balance is consistent across training, validation, and test sets.",

However, we applied our method to the dataset used by XGEP and achieved superior performance compared to their results. Additionally, we included comparisons to simpler baseline models to demonstrate the improvements brought by our approach. Although we did not use publicly available benchmark datasets, we performed comparisons on the same dataset with several graph-based models including GCN, GAT, EMOGI, and MTGCN. Additionally, we compared our method against traditional approaches such as DeepWalk and SVM. These comparisons demonstrate the superior performance of our method across multiple baselines.",

After PCA, we applied min-max scaling to normalize node feature values to a [0, 1] range. For each gene, its expression-based feature vector was combined with its topology in the PPI network to provide the input for the graph neural network. Label data (essential vs. non-essential) were encoded as binary classes (1 for essential, 0 for non-essential).

      "fitting": "In our study, the number of trainable parameters p is moderately higher than the number of training samples. For example, under the STRING network setting, the training set contains around 6,000 genes. We only use 50 node features so our model does not fall into the regime where f > 100. To prevent overfitting, we applied several strategies, including stratified cross-validation, early stopping based on validation performance, dropout, and L2 regularization. These techniques help the model generalize effectively. Conversely, to avoid underfitting, we tuned the model\u2019s complexity (e.g., number of layers and hidden channels).

Missing residues, including those with occupancy equal to zero, were treated as disordered.\n\nFor binding prediction in the disordered regions, A set of 840 peptides, with lengths between 5 and 25 amino acids and solved in complex with globular protein domains, was initially obtained from a previous study (Disfani et al., 2012). They discarded 196 peptides that couldn\u2019t be mapped onto UniProtKB (UniProt,2014) sequences with SIFTS (Velankar et al., 2013)\u2014because they were synthetic constructs, or the PDB files had been superseded, or the ATOM records mapped onto discontinuous fragments. They also removed 247 chains sharing 30% or more sequence identity to other regions, based on the BLASTP alignments generated with the recommended settings for short peptides (-seg no -matrix PAM30 -gapopen 10 -gapextend 1 -word_size 3). The positive training set was therefore made up of 5501 amino acids from 397 regions occurring in as many PDB chains (372 UniprotKB sequences). Just 104 of these UniProtKB chains were also used as positive examples for the new disordered residue prediction modules. Negative training examples were obtained from unbound protein domain linker regions in known protein structures. A total of 1164 linkers annotated in CATH v.3.5 .

CAN used the convolutional attention network to obtain the discrete distribution patterns of SDRs in protein sequences. HAN employed the hierarchical attention model to capture the sequence location of LDRs mainly located in the N\u2019 and C\u2019 of the sequences. IDP-Seq2Seq combined Seq2Seq and attention mechanism to capture the global and non-local correlation features of residues in IDRs. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) was used to extract local features of IDRs, and long short-term memory (LSTM) was used to extract global features of IDRs. The CNN and LSTM were combined to obtain both the local features and global features of IDRs. Two models CNN-LSTM and LSTM-CNN were constructed inspired by SPOT-Disorder2.

A local minimum search algorithm with a minimum relative peak height of 1% was used for chromatographic deconvolution; the maximum peak width was set to 1 min.

This definition of basal cis-regulatory region around promoter was according to GREAT tool. Assigning one GappedPeak to multiple TSS was allowed. 3) For TSS having more than 1 GappedPeak assigned, only the closest one was kept. 4) For genes with multiple TSS and hence multiple assigned GappedPeaks, only the longest GappedPeak was kept. After these four steps, if one gene had been associated with a GappedPeak, then the width of the peak was used as an epigenomic feature in the following machine learning models. If a gene had no associated GappedPeak, then the peak width is 0.  Coverage of H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K36me3, H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9me3, DNase I, and RNA-seq data was used as input for EpiTensor to infer interacting enhancers across distant genomic regions.

The multiple sequence alignments were subsequently input in PhyML for the construction of phylogenetic trees using the Maximum Likelihood method. For amino acid and nucleotide-based tree construction in PhyML, the LG and HKY85 substitution matrices were used, respectively. Additionally, distance matrices were calculated for each tree, where the distance between two leaves corresponds to the sum of the branch lengths separating them.   Comparing two trees can be subject to artefacts and lead in some cases to spurious correlations if speciation events are not taken in account. For this reason, some of the co-evolution features also involve the Tree of Life (ToL) of the 34 genomes studied, which originated from submitting sequences of their respective 16S ribosomal RNA to similar treatment. Since distances in the ToL are computed from a nucleotide-based substitution matrix, the distances in the ToL matrix were rescaled for proper comparison with the protein-based distance matrices. ",

Let A and B be the two MCP ortholog groups, mA and mB their respective matrices, tA and tB their trees. The parameter mirrorAB is the correlation between mA and mB, mirrorA is between mA and ToL, and mirrorB is between mB and ToL. The fourth descriptor, mirrorAB-ToL, involves an adaptation of the mirror tree, also known as tol-mirror, which measures the correlation between mA and mB after removing the background similarity inherent to speciation events in the ToL. The remaining 3 topological features are derived from the Icong index, defined as the probability that the Maximum Agreement Subtree (MAST) between two trees is arising by chance. Along the same idea, topological similarities were computed between tree A and ToL, tree B and ToL, and finally A and B (topA, topB, topAB). ",

After selecting variables based on data, we created a prediction model by training with a fixed set of 35 variables.

With a similar logic, binary variables such as comorbidities were coded as 1 if \u201cyes\u201d and 0 if \u201cno\u201d or \u201cno test\u201d because \u201cno\u201d was the most common value.",
