    "features": "Among the 64 variables, we selected variables that are frequently encountered in clinical practice for prescription of biologics and excluded variables that are not referenced when prescribing biologics. As a result, 15 variables known to be of clinical importance were preselected (i.e., sex, age, baseline DAS28-ESR, methotrexate dose, steroid dose, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive protein [CRP], rheumatoid factor [RF], anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody [ACPA], anti-nuclear antibody [Anot reported], and five comorbidities). Subsequently, 20 variables that were highly correlated with the drug response (remission) of each bDMARD were selected. After selecting variables based on data, we created a prediction model by training with a fixed set of 35 variables. Missing data for variables (Additional file: Table S3) were replaced with the median value for each variable. With a similar logic, binary variables such as comorbidities were coded as 1 if “yes” and 0 if “no” or “no test” because “no” was the most common value.",
    "fitting": "To avoid overfitting problems, the training and test sets were divided in a 7:3 ratio, and the models were trained with the training set; then, the prediction results were verified using the test set. For the training dataset, a 5-fold cross validation was performed to tune the hyperparameters determined as outside models (Additional file: Table S1 and Table S2). In this procedure, a grid search was conducted to evaluate all possible combinations of the hyperparameters. The grid search found optimal hyperparameters with the objective function of determining the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) in each model. Bootstrapping (random sampling with replacement) was also performed to obtain a median value for the AUROC curve and to determine the accuracy for reducing measurement variances caused by small samples when dividing between the training and test sets.",

As patients were scanned at different sites, Combat harmonisation was performed to remove the centre effect (local vs. foreign scans) while retaining the pathophysiologic information (either HER2 expression or pathologic response). The harmonisation employed Bayes estimates to account for both additive and multiplicative scanner effects.\n\nUnivariate analysis was performed to identify significant parameters. Continuous variables were described as mean, standard deviation (SD), and range. The two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test for two independent samples was used to determine significant differences between groups. Correlation analysis was then employed to remove redundant parameters from advancement to model development.

This definition of basal cis-regulatory region around promoter was according to GREAT tool. Assigning one GappedPeak to multiple TSS was allowed.\n3)\tFor TSS having more than 1 GappedPeak assigned, only the closest one was kept.\n4)\tFor genes with multiple TSS and hence multiple assigned GappedPeaks, only the longest GappedPeak was kept.\nAfter these four steps, if one gene had been associated with a GappedPeak, then the width of the peak was used as an epigenomic feature in the following machine learning models. If a gene had no associated GappedPeak, then the peak width is 0.\n\nCoverage of H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K36me3, H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9me3, DNase I, and Rnot reported-seq data was used as input for EpiTensor to infer interacting enhancers across distant genomic regions.

The fourth descriptor, mirrorAB-ToL, involves an adaptation of the mirror tree, also known as tol-mirror, which measures the correlation between mA and mB after removing the background similarity inherent to speciation events in the ToL.\nThe remaining 3 topological features are derived from the Icong index, defined as the probability that the Maximum Agreement Subtree (MAST) between two trees is arising by chance. Along the same idea, topological similarities were computed between tree A and ToL, tree B and ToL, and finally A and B (topA, topB, topAB).\n",

By organizing these indices into columns, an AAindex matrix is created, where rows represent amino acids and columns represent indices. Firstly, we z-score normalized the columns of this matrix and then reduced its dimensionality to 11 dimensions using PCA to remove redundant information (after dimensionality reduction, over 99% of the variance can be explained), resulting in the AAindex11 matrix. A peptide and paired CDR3 were then padded to a maximum length of 20 and encoded into a 20 x 11 feature matrix using the AAindex11 matrix. Additionally, the BLOSUM50 matrix is a more general method, encoding each amino acid as a 20-length vector.

Other subsets use species taxonomy, one for vertebrates (VPOD_vert_het_1.0) and another for invertebrates (VPOD_inv_het_1.0). For taxonomic subsets, we considered all sequences from phylum Chordata as ‘vertebrates’ and the rest as 'invertebrates’. Another subset excludes all mutant opsin sequences, called ‘wild-types’ (VPOD_wt_het_1.0). A final named subset is the whole data set (VPOD_wds_het_1.0). \nUsing various subsets of data, we performed a number of experiments to better understand the performance of ML models in predicting λmax. First, to better understand how training data relate to model performance, R2 , and training data size, we gradually increased the size of training datasets, using the WDS, Vertebrate, WT, and Rod subsets separately, by adding between 15-50 randomly selected sequences at a time, repeating the process three times per data split (Table S1). We then analyzed the fit between the size of training data sets (x-axis) and model performance (y-axis), comparing six non-linear models with AIC to find the model that best explains the observed variation (Figure S2). Second, to understand if ML could predict known phenotypic changes due to experimental mutations, we queried the top performing WT model (which lacks data from artificially mutated sequences) using all experimentally mutated opsins to predict their phenotypes. We plotted these results using matplotlib [49] to visualize characteristics of poorly predicted outliers (e.g., taxonomic bias or sensitivity to mutations which caused large shifts in λmax from the WT). Third, we examined the ability of our models to predict λmax of thirty invertebrate opsins not in VPOD_1.0 because they are only known from physiological studies (Table S3, Figure S4). Here, we collected data both characterized by single-cell microspectrophotometry (MSP) or electroretinogram methods and with expression localized to cell-type by in-situ-hybridization (ISH), to link λmax to a specific opsin (the sequences and metadata can be found in ‘msp_erg_raw.txt’ and ‘msp_erg_meta.tsv’, while the resulting predictions can be found under the ‘msp_tests’ folder on our GitHub repository). Finally, we directly compared predictive capabilities of models trained on different data subsets by randomly selecting and removing the same 25 wild-type ultraviolet or short-wave sensitive opsins from the training data of the WDS, Vertebrate, WT, and UVS/SWS models before training and querying the model with those same sequences following training (Table S3, Figure S5). \"\n",

    "comparison": "We didn't compare to an existing publicly available ML methods. However, we compared performance of ML models to phylogenetic imputation, which estimates phenotypes using phylogenetic information. Phylogenetic imputation uses maximum likelihood (we will not abbreviate maximum likelihood as ML to avoid confusion with machine learning), assuming Brownian Motion to predict missing phenotypes using a phylogenetic tree, assuming more closely related species or sequences have more similar phenotypes. We randomly removed 50 opsin sequences, and their corresponding λmax values from each of the training datasets used to train our ML models (with the exception of the smaller MWS/LWS and invertebrate datasets, in which we only removed 15), then estimated the removed λmax values using phylogenetic imputation. We used the phylogenetic imputation sub-module of the phytools R package for performing imputation. We compared imputed and actual λmax using regression. ",

Currently, methods used for MOB typing annotation rely on relaxase-based approaches such as MOB-suite and MOBscan. However, in metagenomic plasmid assembly fragments, relaxase sequences are often missing or incomplete. As a result, most plasmid assembly fragments are annotated as non-transferable plasmids. Due to differences in sequence features and host range among different MOB types, this study utilized the Skip-gram language model to digitally encode the biological patterns and features of metagenomic plasmid assembly fragments, resulting in significant performance improvements for MOBFinder. With a training dataset of up to 990,000 entries, Random Forest was used to prevent overfitting in training the MOB classification models. The combined use of these two algorithms effectively enhanced the performance of predicting MOB types in metagenomic plasmid assembly fragments. In some cases, F1 and AUC scores reached as high as 0.99, almost perfect.",

The two-layer neural network consists of a hidden layer with 100 neurons. Finally, 100-dimensional word vectors corresponding to 256 DNA 4-mer \"words\" were outputted. 2. Training of the MOB classification model: This study utilized known relaxases of MOB types to perform MOB typing on plasmid genomes, selecting plasmid genomes with confirmed MOB types based on their scores to construct benchmark datasets. For each MOB type of plasmid genome, the training and testing sets were divided in a 7:3 ratio. The training set for each MOB type randomly generated 90,000 simulated metagenomic plasmid assembly fragments, while the testing set for each MOB type randomly generated 500 simulated metagenomic plasmid assembly fragments.

The minimum positive points of each label is set to 50. Because we formulate the plasmid protein function prediction as a multi-class, multi-label classification on 377 labels (172 MF labels + 174 BP labels + 31 CC labels), we can't show all the detailed number of positive/negative points for the 377 binary classifications here. However, you can check more detailed information from the Supplementary Figure S3 in the manuscript. Because we manually curated the dataset based on the RefSeq database, the protein sequences and their GO annotations are very reliable.",
    "splits": "There are three sub-tasks for our tool, namely the GO term classifications on the MF, BP, and CC categories, respectively. The detailed training/validation/test ratios for the three sub-tasks are 99,806/56,491/17,369, 60,143/29,768/10,034, and 21,228/4,045/2,808. You might find that the splitting ratio is not fixed, because we curated this dataset by simulating the novel protein function prediction scenario. Specifically, for each GO category, we allocated 10% of the most recently released proteins with GO annotations as the test set. Additionally, we ensure that the novel test set significantly differs from the training set in terms of protein sequences. Therefore, among the remaining 90% annotated proteins, those lacking significant alignments (E-value>1e-3) to the test set were assigned to the training set, while others were assigned to the validation set.

We use just the definitive cases and controls in this analysis.\n\nThe dataset is well-used and established, having been described and used in many other papers for exploring Alzheimer’s disease (for example, the data description manuscript: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29184913/).\n",

The validation set was used for determining hyperparameters and during training to institute early stopping of the dataset when improvement ceased to avoid overfitting.\n\nWe do not plot the distribution of data types in the dataset as it is composed of primarily genetic data, and plotting the distribution of genetic data is difficult due to the huge number of data points. However, we note the overall distribution of ADSP data points is available on the website for ADSP and cite manuscripts deciding the distributions further: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29184913.

The number of features is very large; however, the model is parameterized not on the genetic variants themselves but on the types of variants and how they impact genes (of which there are 9).

The document mentions that an independent validation set was indeed used, but it does not provide the specific number of samples in the validation set. To ensure the rationality of data distribution, the researchers examined the frequency distribution of HLA alleles that bind to peptides in the IEDB database. The results show that the frequency distribution of HLA alleles in the training set, validation set, and test set exhibits highly similar characteristics (see Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 5). Therefore, it can be concluded that the distribution of data types in the training set and test set is similar. The document notes that the distribution of data types for the training set, validation set, and test set has all been visualized. Specifically, Figure 2 shows the distribution of major HLA-I alleles across different datasets, while Supplementary Figure 5 displays the distribution of the top 50 alleles for HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP.",

The novelty of this algorithm lies in its utilization of cutting-edge deep learning techniques, such as Transformers and ESM2 embeddings, to enhance prediction accuracy and efficiency. This new approach was chosen over more traditional models due to its higher specificity and sensitivity in identifying immunogenic epitopes and novel epitopes. Moreover, by merging all epitopes into a single positive sample class and using negative samples in a 1:1 ratio during training, this method learns unified epitope features, enabling better differentiation between epitopes and regular peptide sequences. This not only improves prediction accuracy but also significantly reduces the need for chemical experiments, lowering costs, and demonstrating greater robustness and reliability in antigen selection tasks across diverse populations.",

While two-stage methods, including Mask R-CNN, provide a strong balance between detection precision and efficiency, additional integration of attention mechanisms, such as transformer architectures, can further enhance spatially aware segmentation but often require more computational resources and training data.

We included an initial linear learning rate warm-up for the first 100 iterations, starting at 0.00001, and ending at the learning rate of 0.01. This was chosen to stop the sharp initial updates from the initial COCO weights, which can lead to instability \\citep{glimer21}.

    "encoding": "A preprocessed version of the Human Connectome Project's (HCP) Young Adults dataset was used. While a comprehensive and detailed description has been published elsewhere [1], a concise description of the steps involved is as follows: In a first step, correction for distortions related to gradient nonlinearity (which is more pronounced in the HCP’s scanner setup) was applied with a FreeSurfer software package. The FSL software’s FLIRT method was then used to correct for head motion. Grand-mean intensity normalization was performed on the fMRI time series. One of the keystones of fMRI studies is reliable intersubject comparability, which requires translating a subject’s physical space into a common standard space (”registering”). The HCP addressed this fundamental issue via multimodal registering, i.e. using a variety of imaging modalities to reliably and automati- cally identify anatomical or functional landmarks in each subject’s 3D data and align them accordingly in what they call grayordi- nate space, a derivate of Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, in which only matter of interest (i.e. gray matter) is preserved. Building on work described in [2], Glasser et al. [3] developed a multi-modal and mapped areal-feature-based (dubbed ”MSMAll”) registration method, which uses myelin maps, resting-state brain networks, visuotopic maps, and a subcortical region of interest for inter-subject alignment (see the supplemental methods of [3] for implementation details).  The analysis is a parcellated analysis. For the cerebral cortex, HCP-MMP1.0 (Human Connectome Project Multi- Modal Parcellation version 1.0, [3]) by Glasser et al. was used. They delineated 180 parcels per hemisphere (360 in total) by using the overlap of four areal feature maps, one for each modality (cortical thickness, relative myelin content, tfMRI, rsfMRI). Subcortical parcels were provided by Tian et al. [4]. They relied on subcortical-to-cortical connectivity derived from the HCP’s rsfMRI data to delineate 27 subcortical parcels per hemisphere (54 in total) along connectivity gradients, i.e. sufficiently stark changes in func tional connectivity. Finally, cerebellar parcels came from a HCP-based study which clustered neighboring cerebellar voxels into 100 parcels by means of similarity of their rsfMRI time-series [5].

For each ground truth nucleus, predictions within a 15 pixel (3.3 μm) were identified. This radius is smaller than the average size of lymphocytes, which form the smallest nuclei in the dataset. Matching was performed based on the highest predictive score (if available) or the shortest distance. After matching, the ground truth was censored until all ground truth nuclei were either matched or classified as a false negative. Using the identified true positives, false positives, and false negatives, precision (all correct predictions divided by all predictions) and recall (all correct predictions divided by all ground truth nuclei) were calculated. The class F1 score was computed as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, ranging from 0 to 1. Finally to compare models, micro F1  (aggregation of TP, FP, and FN over all classes, followed by F1 score calculation) and Average F1  (the average of class F1 scores) were calculated [40]. Results are shown with a 95% confidence interval which is calculated through bootstrapping the samples. \n\nBoth models and intra- and interobserver agreement were evaluated using the DICE score. The DICE score is a harmonic mean between 0 and 1, in which 1 is a perfect segmentation prediction, and 0 is no correct prediction. This can result in inflated high average DICE scores if a tissue class is only present in a few samples, as the DICE score is 1 in the case of a correct absent prediction. To accommodate this, we calculated not only the average DICE score over all samples but also the micro average DICE. This is the DICE score for all predictions concatenated along one axis, resulting in a prediction mask of 1024 × 96.256 pixels. Results are shown with a 95% confidence interval which is generated through bootstrapping the sample results. \n\nMetrics are in line with literature (Maier-Hein, L., Reinke, A., Godau, P. et al.

All individual data captured of each plant, at each timestep, was encapsulated into their own directories. \nThe main data consists of RGB images and depth maps of each plant, captured from positions equidistance around the centre of each plant. Each position for each image was recorded and stored as a transform file and COLMAP point cloud, which ensures that these images can be utilised for 3D reconstruction using Neural Radiance Fields, 3D Gaussian Splatting or other supported models/frameworks.\nApproximately 320 images and depth maps were captured for each plant instance- this would vary depending on if the robot setup failed to reach some of the positions. For each of the plant instances, we also include all model weights and training parameters, which can be executed using NeRFStudio.\nThis dataset is novel and is introduced along with the supported manuscript. ",
    "splits": "For each plant, there are around 35 images used for evaluation (284 images for training). These datasets were distributed evenly based on our capturing process (see IV.3).\nImages assigned to the training set or evaluation sets are labelled with '_train' or '_eval' in each file name. Furthermore, separate transform files have been generated for both training and evaluation images. Validation sets are not required for training view synthesis models (at least in this instance).",

The transformer is a deep neural network structure for sequence modeling. The self-attention mechanism establishes attention connections between each token in a sequence, so the embedding of each token contains implicit context. Meanwhile, the cross-attention mechanism establishes attention connections between tokens in two sequences, enabling the model to extract the dependency between tokens in the two sequences. Both self-attention and cross-attention are adopted in our model. Self-attention captures intra-modality interaction, such as gene-gene relationships, while cross-attention models inter-modality interaction, which is the peak-gene relationship.",

These architectures were selected for their proven capabilities in medical image processing rather than developing entirely new algorithms. Importantly, autoencoders offer advantages over Vision Transformers (ViT) for our application as they require significantly less training data, making them more suitable for the relatively modest size of brain MRI datasets available in medical research contexts.\n\nFor the downstream clinical prediction tasks, we implemented intentionally simple and easily trainable ML algorithms: Ridge regression for quantitative variables, L2-penalized logistic regression for categorical variables, and random survival forests for survival analysis. This methodological choice was deliberate, as our primary objective was not to maximize absolute prediction performance, but rather to establish a standardized framework for comparing the quality of embeddings generated by each autoencoder architecture.

The autoencoder approach was specifically chosen to automatically learn relevant features from the raw imaging data in an unsupervised manner.

While no traditional feature selection was performed, the model architecture itself acts as a dimensionality reduction mechanism, compressing the high-dimensional input data to between 1,000-5,000 features for conventional autoencoders and exactly 2,048 features for variational autoencoders, which are then used for downstream clinical prediction tasks.",

HAN employed the hierarchical attention model to capture the sequence location of LDRs mainly located in the N’ and C’ of the sequences. IDP-Seq2Seq combined Seq2Seq and attention mechanism to capture the global and non-local correlation features of residues in IDRs. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) was used to extract local features of IDRs, and long short-term memory (LSTM) was used to extract global features of IDRs.

The outcomes of Phase 1 include several optimal model solutions (single predictors), while Phase 2 yielded the final predictors, PUNCH2 and PUNCH2-light. These predictors were trained on larger datasets and benchmarked on CAID2, CAID3, and CAID1 datasets for validation.",

Missing residues, including those with occupancy equal to zero, were treated as disordered.\n\nFor binding prediction in the disordered regions, A set of 840 peptides, with lengths between 5 and 25 amino acids and solved in complex with globular protein domains, was initially obtained from a previous study (Disfani et al., 2012). They discarded 196 peptides that couldn’t be mapped onto UniProtKB (UniProt,2014) sequences with SIFTS (Velankar et al., 2013)—because they were synthetic constructs, or the PDB files had been superseded, or the ATOM records mapped onto discontinuous fragments. They also removed 247 chains sharing 30% or more sequence identity to other regions, based on the BLASTP alignments generated with the recommended settings for short peptides (-seg no -matrix PAM30 -gapopen 10 -gapextend 1 -word_size 3). The positive training set was therefore made up of 5501 amino acids from 397 regions occurring in as many PDB chains (372 UniprotKB sequences). Just 104 of these UniProtKB chains were also used as positive examples for the new disordered residue prediction modules. Negative training examples were obtained from unbound protein domain linker regions in known protein structures. A total of 1164 linkers annotated in CATH v.3.5 .

    "interpretability": "The EGT model is not entirely a black box; it has elements of interpretability: Feature Importance via Self - Attention Mechanisms: The self - attention mechanism in the EGT model assigns weights to each SNP, capturing long - range dependencies and complex interactions within the sequence. This allows for an understanding of which SNPs are more important in predicting quantitative traits. By examining the attention weights, researchers can gain insights into the relative importance of different SNPs. QTL - guided Feature Engineering: The model uses QTL - guided feature engineering to identify SNPs associated with quantitative traits. This approach incorporates prior biological knowledge about the genetic markers linked to specific traits, making the feature selection process more interpretable. Researchers can understand which genetic markers are being used for predictions and their relevance to the traits of interest. Biological Interpretability through GWAS: The integration of GWAS analysis helps identify 14 QTL in the AQT IV dataset. This provides a biological basis for the model's predictions, allowing researchers to connect the genetic variations identified by the model with specific traits. Visualization of Predictions: The article provides examples where the EGT model successfully predicted animal quantitative traits, with predictions closely matching the Ground Truth values. These visualizations demonstrate the model's ability to make accurate predictions and offer a way to interpret its performance. However, it's important to note that the EGT model is a deep learning model, and while it incorporates elements of interpretability, it may still have some aspects that are not fully transparent. The model's interpretability is enhanced through the use of attention mechanisms, QTL - guided feature engineering, and biological validation, but the complex nature of deep learning models means that some level of interpretability challenge may still exist.",

    "algorithm": "The ML algorithm used in the article is a deep learning. We chose to develop and utilize EGT over better - known alternatives for several reasons:\nHandling the sequential nature of genomic data: Traditional methods like GBLUP, LASSO, LGBM, CNN, and LSTM have limitations in effectively handling the sequential nature of genomic data and capturing the intricate relationships between Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) and their phenotypic expressions. EGT leverages the power of the Transformer model's self - attention mechanisms to address this challenge.\nImproved prediction accuracy: The custom loss function in EGT, which combines the R - squared correlation coefficient with Mean Squared Error (MSE), enhances prediction precision. Testing on diverse animal species demonstrated significantly improved prediction accuracy compared to conventional methods.\nBetter feature extraction capabilities: EGT's combination of autoencoders and self - attention mechanisms allows for more effective feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. This enables the model to learn more complex and abstract feature representations, leading to better performance in predicting quantitative traits.\nSuperior performance across multiple test datasets: The EGT model outperformed existing methods in terms of MSE and R - squared values across multiple test datasets, proving its effectiveness in accurately predicting animal quantitative traits.\nThe development of EGT was driven by the need to overcome the limitations of traditional methods and provide a more powerful solution for genetic selection and breeding programs.",
    "meta": "The EGT model does not use data from other ML algorithms as input. It primarily uses SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) sequences as input data. The model's architecture is designed to directly process and analyze the genomic data through its self - attention mechanisms and autoencoders, without relying on the output or predictions from other ML algorithms as input features.",

    "encoding": "The data used in the ML algorithm underwent several preprocessing steps: Ordinal Encoding: The nucleotide bases (A, T, G, C) were converted to numerical values using the NumPy package to enable mathematical operations on the SNP sequences. Missing Data Handling: Two approaches were employed - imputation to fill gaps using statistical methods and deletion to remove samples with extensive missing information. Dataset Split: The dataset was split into training and test sets at a 7:3 ratio. This ensured a robust and reliable foundation for model training and evaluation while maintaining the true data distribution. All individuals from the same dataset were either in the training/validation set or the test set. After the initial split, five - fold cross - validation was performed on the training set.",
    "features": "The EGT model uses SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) sequences as input features. The number of features (f) varies across the different datasets used in the study.

The dataset was split into training and test sets at a 7:3 ratio before any model training.",
    "fitting": "The number of parameters (p) in the EGT model is much larger than the number of training points. To rule out overfitting, the authors employed several strategies: Custom Loss Function: The EGT model uses a custom loss function that combines the R-squared correlation coefficient with Mean Squared Error (MSE). This helps the model focus on the correlation between predicted and observed quantitative traits, enhancing prediction precision. Regularization Techniques: The model incorporates residual connections before and after the MLP head. Residual connections help mitigate the vanishing gradient problem and allow the model to learn deeper and more abstract feature representations. Cross-Validation: Five-fold cross-validation was performed on the training set to ensure robust model generalization. Data Preprocessing: The data underwent rigorous preprocessing, including ordinal encoding, imputation of missing data, and deletion of samples with extensive missing information. This helps ensure the quality and consistency of the training data.",

It provides an indication of the model's prediction error. Lower MSE values indicate better model performance.\nR-squared Correlation Coefficient (R²): This metric measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. It indicates how well the model explains the genetic variation. Higher R² values suggest a better model fit.",
    "comparison": "Yes, a comparison to publicly available methods was performed on benchmark datasets. The EGT model was compared with four state - of - the - art methods for predicting animal quantitative traits: Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (GBLUP), LASSO regression, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Long Short - Term Memory (LSTM). These methods are widely recognized and used in the field of genomic prediction and machine learning.\nAdditionally, the comparison included simpler baselines. GBLUP and LASSO can be considered simpler baseline methods compared to the more complex deep learning approaches like CNN, LSTM, and EGT. The results of these comparisons demonstrated that the EGT model outperformed the compared methods in most cases across the three AQT test datasets, showing superior predictive performance.",

The ANOVA yielded a P - value of 0.032, which is below the commonly used significance level of 0.05. This suggests that there are significant differences in predictive performance between the EGT model and other models. Additionally, a Z - score of 2.01 was obtained, which exceeds the critical value of 1.96 corresponding to a 95% confidence level. This indicates that the difference between the model's predicted values and the actual values is statistically significant.",

This difference in staining types between the training and test sets allows us to evaluate the generalization capability of our models on unseen staining types.\nIn our paper, we have included T-SNE plots that visualize the feature distributions of the datasets. These plots demonstrate that the features in CellBinDB are broadly distributed and cover characteristics from most publicly available datasets. This broad coverage explains why fine-tuning models on CellBinDB improves their performance on third-party datasets they have not seen before, thereby validating the utility and comprehensiveness of our dataset.\n",

The test set in each fold includes around 3,000 positive samples and an equal number of randomly sampled negatives, resulting in roughly 6,000 test samples per fold. No separate validation set was used; all evaluation was performed using 5-fold cross-validation. The distributions of data types (RNA categories and disease classes) were kept consistent across folds through random stratified splitting. While data distribution plots were not included, care was taken to ensure balanced representation in both training and test sets.",
    "redundancy": "The dataset was randomly split using 5-fold cross-validation. For each fold, training and test sets were strictly separated with no overlapping RNA–disease pairs. This independence was enforced using binary mask matrices that explicitly define which entries are used for training or testing.

    "algorithm": "The algorithm belongs to the class of graph neural networks (GNNs) and multi-task learning architectures. Specifically, we use a Multi-gate Mixture-of-Experts (MMoE) framework combined with a Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HAN), designed to learn shared and task-specific representations across multiple RNA types (lncRNA, circRNA, miRNA, piRNA). While MMoE and HAN are existing models, this combination is novel in the context of heterogeneous ncRNA–disease association prediction.\n\nWe chose this architecture because it allows information sharing across related tasks while maintaining specialization through expert selection. Compared to single-task or flat GNN baselines (e.g., GCN, GAT), this structure improved performance and interpretability across all RNA types.",
    "meta": "No, the model does not use the outputs of other machine learning algorithms as input. All predictions are directly generated from the original input features (node attributes and edge structure) within a unified end-to-end architecture. There is no meta-predictor stage, and no stacking or ensembling of separate models was performed. The 5-fold cross-validation ensures strict separation between training and test data.",
    "config": "Yes. All hyperparameter configurations, optimization settings, and model files (including trained weights and training scripts) are publicly available in the GitHub repository and will be archived in GigaDB upon acceptance. The GitHub repository includes the training script with command-line arguments for hyperparameters, and configuration values are documented in the README. Trained model files (.pt) and cross-validation scores are included in the `scores/` directory. The code is released under an OSI-compliant open-source license (e.g., MIT or Apache 2.0).",
    "encoding": "The ncRNA–disease data were represented as a heterogeneous graph with multiple relation types (miRNA–disease, lncRNA–disease, circRNA–disease, piRNA–disease). Each node type (RNA, disease) was assigned initial feature vectors. For RNAs, one-hot encodings of sequence types or statistical features (e.g., k-mer counts) were used where applicable; for diseases, semantic embeddings derived from the DOID ontology were used. All features were normalized. The adjacency matrix was binarized (1 for known association, 0 otherwise), and reliable negative samples were generated using the spy technique. Masks were used to define training and test regions in the matrix.",
    "features": "Each RNA and disease node is represented by a fixed-length feature vector. For RNAs, the input feature dimension is typically 64 or 128 depending on configuration; for diseases, features were projected to the same dimension using a linear layer. In total, the feature dimension per node is f = 128. No explicit feature selection was performed. All features were retained and used as input. The input features were derived from domain knowledge (e.g., sequence encodings, ontology embeddings) and not learned from the training set alone.",
    "fitting": "Yes, the number of trainable parameters (p ≈ 1–2 million) is larger than the number of training points in each fold, and the feature dimension (f ≈ 128) is also relatively high. To reduce overfitting risk, we applied multiple strategies: dropout layers were used throughout the model (including attention and expert modules), early layers were regularized, and 5-fold cross-validation was used for evaluation. Additionally, no test data was used during training, and performance was monitored across folds to ensure consistency. The model showed stable generalization across folds, indicating overfitting was effectively controlled.",
    "parameters": "The model has approximately 1.2 to 2.0 million trainable parameters, depending on the chosen hidden dimensions, number of experts, and expert layer size. The total parameter count includes the HAN encoder, expert networks, gating layers, and attention modules. The values of hyperparameters (e.g., hidden_dim, expert_dim, num_experts, num_heads) were manually selected based on validation performance using 5-fold cross-validation. No exhaustive grid search was conducted; instead, we evaluated a small set of reasonable configurations based on prior work and model capacity considerations.",
    "regularization": "Yes, multiple regularization techniques were applied to prevent overfitting. Dropout layers were used in both the expert networks and attention modules. L2 regularization was applied implicitly via the optimizer. Additionally, the model’s multi-task structure (MMoE) encourages parameter sharing and reduces the risk of overfitting to any single RNA type. While early stopping was not explicitly applied, 5-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate generalization, and no test data was used during training.",

  "evaluation": {
    "method": "The method was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation. Known RNA–disease associations were randomly partitioned into five folds, and in each run, one fold was used for testing while the remaining four were used for training. Reliable negative samples were constructed separately for each fold using the spy technique. No associations from the test set were used during training, ensuring strict separation. Evaluation metrics were averaged across all folds to assess generalization performance.",
    "measure": "We report AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve), AUPR (Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve), and Ranking Index (RI) as performance metrics. These metrics are widely used in ncRNA–disease association prediction tasks and are well-suited for imbalanced binary classification problems. AUC and AUPR measure the classifier’s ability to distinguish positive and negative associations, while RI evaluates the ranking quality of predicted associations. This set of metrics is representative and consistent with standard practices in recent biomedical machine learning literature.",
    "comparison": "Yes. The proposed method was compared against both publicly available methods and simpler baseline models using the same dataset and evaluation protocol. The comparisons were conducted using 5-fold cross-validation to ensure fairness and reproducibility. The results demonstrated that our model achieved superior performance across multiple metrics, confirming its effectiveness over existing alternatives.",
    "confidence": "Performance metrics were averaged over 5-fold cross-validation, and standard deviations were reported to indicate variability. While formal confidence intervals were not computed, the observed performance improvements over baselines were consistent across all folds. This consistency suggests that the model's superiority is statistically meaningful, although no formal statistical significance tests (e.g., p-values) were conducted.",
    "availability": "Yes. The raw evaluation outputs, including prediction scores, evaluation scripts, and fold-wise performance logs, are available in the GitHub repository and will be archived in GigaDB upon publication.

While MMoE and HAN are existing models, this combination is novel in the context of heterogeneous ncRNA–disease association prediction.\n\nWe chose this architecture because it allows information sharing across related tasks while maintaining specialization through expert selection. Compared to single-task or flat GNN baselines (e.g., GCN, GAT), this structure improved performance and interpretability across all RNA types.",

Each node type (RNA, disease) was assigned initial feature vectors. For RNAs, one-hot encodings of sequence types or statistical features (e.g., k-mer counts) were used where applicable; for diseases, semantic embeddings derived from the DOID ontology were used. All features were normalized. The adjacency matrix was binarized (1 for known association, 0 otherwise), and reliable negative samples were generated using the spy technique. Masks were used to define training and test regions in the matrix.",

Additionally, no test data was used during training, and performance was monitored across folds to ensure consistency. The model showed stable generalization across folds, indicating overfitting was effectively controlled.",

L2 regularization was applied implicitly via the optimizer. Additionally, the model’s multi-task structure (MMoE) encourages parameter sharing and reduces the risk of overfitting to any single RNA type.

The independent validation dataset included 424 males (212 ASD, 212 NTC) from 16 sites. All individuals were matched on age and head motion using propensity score matching.",

Summary statistics and cohort characteristics are presented in the manuscript (e.g., flowcharts in Figure 5 and 6), though full distributions are not plotted. In figure 3 we show that the model's predictions are not significantly correlated with key confounds.",

Furthermore, we report the FC signature derived from the model that is associated with identification of the ASD group, providing a neurobiologically meaningful basis for the predictions.",

TCP is not a standard inductive learning algorithm but a transductive method that produces confidence measures for individual predictions. This approach was chosen to ensure high-confidence, low false-positive predictions of autism diagnosis, prioritizing specificity over sensitivity. Unlike traditional classifiers, TCP assesses conformity of each test instance to known classes, allowing predictions only when confident. This novelty aligns with the clinical goal of identifying a high-risk autism signature with strong precision.",

These subtype similarity scores serve as input features for the logistic regression classifier within the conformal prediction framework.

Therefore, the training of initial predictors (clustering + logistic regression) and the classification of test data remain independent, avoiding data leakage.",

For each of the 18 MIST atlas networks (excluding cerebellar networks due to coverage limitations), the average time series was extracted and Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated between this time series and the time series of all non-cerebellar voxels in the brain. To mitigate confounding effects we performed ordinary least squares regression to remove variance associated with age and head motion parameters from the FC maps, retaining the residuals for analysis. For dimensionality reduction, we applied hierarchical agglomerative clustering to FC maps across the discovery cohort, identifying five FC subtypes. The final input features consisted of each subject's spatial similarity to the five subtype centroids (per network).",

Overfitting was further controlled by bootstrap resampling to assess model stability, and use of the transductive approach, which reduces overfitting to the training set since there's no global model to overfit. Both over- and underfitting were further addressed by validating performance on an independent dataset.",
    "parameters": "The logistic regression within the conformal prediction framework involved two key parameters: (1) the ASD class weight (w = 10^16), which heavily penalizes false positives to prioritize specificity, and (2) the conformal rejection threshold (5%), which selects only high-confidence predictions. These were empirically chosen to align with the clinical goal of reliable ASD identification. Standard binomial logistic regression without additional regularization was used (no L1/L2 penalties or C parameter), as the focus was on conformal prediction scoring rather than optimizing inductive model parameters.",

SNP quality control was performed by eliminating variants with duplicate IDs, those with missing values (geno = 0, keeping only genotyped SNPs with a dosage of 0, 1, or 2), variants that deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) by p-value <1e-6, and variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) <0.001. SNP quality control operations were carried out in the default PLINK2 order. Family-related subjects were eliminated using the in-house protocol[35]. In addition, we used subjects of European ancestry to minimize the effects of population structure, which can fade some of the phenotype-related genetic signal[36]. Note that approximately 6% from the UKB population are of a non‑European ethnicity. The age covariate was min-max normalized to range between zero and one. SNPs were coded as 0, 1, 2 for homozygous for the alternative allele, hetero-, and homozygous for the reference allele, respectively, assuming additive allele effects. To create 5 repetitions, the samples were randomly split into an 85% training set and a 15% test set. For each repetition, 1,000 random samples were taken from the training set to serve as the validation set. Overall, the DRIP method is based on dimensionality reduction (DR) of genomic data and the subsequent use of a learning prediction model algorithm. Reducing the number of features For the first stage of DRIP method, we examine two unsupervised approaches for DR, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Autoencoder. Principal component analysis (PCA). We trained PCA on the SNP data using the Scikit-learn Python package[37]. Due to existing resource limits, we trained separate dimensionality reduction models on the training data for each of the 22 chromosomes for all the SNPs (for the five repetitions, using autosomal chromosomes) for the dimensionality reduction process. Such a large dataset in high dimensions could not be loaded into memory at once. Therefore, we split the data into 1,000 samples each. We used iterative algorithms, meaning the model was updated based on a batch of 1,000 samples in each iteration. The first 10% of the principal components were the features used in DRIP’s second stage. Autoencoder. As an additional, non-linear methods for unsupervised DR, we used a deep-autoencoder. We trained a fully connected autoencoder model with the TensorFlow Python package[38]. The autoencoder was trained for each chromosome separately. The network was designed as an encoder with two hidden layers, with the second layer being the feature compression layer (bottleneck) and a decoder with one hidden layer. We chose to add dropout layers to prevent overfitting. This technique is known for its ability to efficiently combine different neural network architectures[39]. Each hidden layer had a dropout layer with a rate of 0.1, except for the bottleneck. The number of neurons in each hidden layer was 20%, 10%, and 20% of the input SNP number, respectively. We performed hyperparameter tuning using the validation set for the activation functions and for the learning rate, where the best configuration was chosen according to the root mean square error (RMSE) metric that measures the average magnitude of prediction errors. As hyperparameter tuning is a resource-intensive task, which takes long run times, we performed the tuning on chromosome 22 and used optimal hyperparameters for the other chromosomes. We trained our model using the Adam Optimizer[40] and the mean squared error (MSE) loss function with a batch size of 250 over 500 epochs. The chosen activation functions were PReLU[41] for the hidden layers and linear for the output layer, and the best learning rate was 1e-5.  The model training was performed using a single RTX6000 GPU and 58 GB of RAM. The evaluation of conserved information of DR was performed as mentioned above. The bottleneck, which contained 10% neurons relative to the original number of SNPs, was used as features to the learning models. In addition, we compare the unsupervised DR to GWAS based supervised SNP selection. Supervised SNP selection. Based on the GWAS results, we calculated for each phenotype a threshold for the 10% lowest p-values. The thresholds were 0.096< p <0.0173 for all phenotypes. SNPs with lower p-values than the thresholds were used as features for the prediction models.",

    "provenance": "We generated raw nanopore signal data to create 'dead' and 'alive' classes for each of the following conditions: UV-treated Escherichia coli, UV-treated Chlamydia suis, antibiotic-treated E. coli alone (no mock community), and an antibiotic-treated quasi-mock community containing E. coli and Klebsiella oxytoca.\nWe cultured E. coli K12 in 200 mL Luria-Bertani (LB) medium for 24 hours at 37°C to reach the log phase of the growth curve. The culture was then used to inoculate four 200 mL LB media in 1L Erlenmeyer flasks, which were again incubated for 24 hours to reach the growth log phase. One of the media was used as viable control, i.e. DNA was extracted from 750 uL of the living culture using the spin-column based QIAGEN PowerSoil Pro Kit (QIAGEN, 2018, Hilden, Germany), following the manufacturers’ instructions. The remaining three cultures were killed by one of the following stressors: UV irradiation at 254 nm for 15 min, heat shock at 120°C for 5 min, or bead beating for 30 min. To then separate extracellular DNA from cell debris and intact bacterial cells, we centrifuged the media for 10 min at 4,000 x g and filtered the supernatant through 0.2 µm filters. The resulting extracellular DNA was subsequently kept at room temperature for 5 days to simulate the natural accumulation of DNA degradation. DNA from dead bacteria was extracted from these samples using the same extraction approach following the QIAGEN PowerSoil Pro Kit protocol, but the first lysis buffer step was omitted since cell lysis had already happened. \nWe then used Oxford Nanopore Technologies’ Rapid Barcoding library preparation kit (RBK114-24 V14), R10.4.1 MinION flow cells, and MinKNOW software v23.04.5 for shotgun nanopore sequencing of the “viable” and “dead” DNA. We used four barcodes for each sample, resulting in DNA input of 800 ng and 218 ng for the preparation of the “viable” and “dead” library, respectively. We ran each library for 24 h, using two different flow cells to avoid any cross contamination, and filtered the resulting nanopore data at a minimum read length of 20 b. Raw nanopore data was created using the standard translocation speed of 400 b/s, and a sampling frequency of 5 kHz.\nWe applied Dorado v4.2.0 (https://github.com/nanoporetech/dorado) SUP-basecalling (dna_r10.4.1_e8.2_400bps_sup@v4.2.0) and 6mA-aware SUP-basecalling (6mA@v1) to all nanopore reads that had passed internal data quality thresholds to obtain E. coli DNA sequence data. We subsequently removed sequencing adapters and barcodes using Porechop v0.2.3 (https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop). The Chlamydia suis strain S45 (kindly provided by J. Storz, Baton Rouge, LA, USA) was cultured as described by Leonard et al. [55]. Briefly, chlamydiae were grown in the epithelial rhesus monkey kidney cell line LLM-MK2 (provided by IZSLER, Brescia, Italy) and prepared as semi-purified stock by scraping infected cells into the supernatant and removal of cellular debris by centrifugation at 500 g for 10 min. Chlamydiae were then pelleted (10’000 x g, 45 min) and resuspended in sucrose phosphate glutamate buffer (SPG). To determine the viability of this stock, one aliquot was thawed on ice and separated into two tubes of which one was UV-inactivated using a Hoefer UVC 500 Ultraviolet Crosslinker (Hoefer Inc., Bridgewater MA 02324, United States): Briefly, samples were kept on ice and exposed to 8 watts of UV light at 12.5 cm for 30 min, similar to previously described protocols [56]. All samples were prepared in biological duplicates. UV-inactivated chlamydia were then further incubated at room temperature for 48 h prior to further processing, while viable chlamydiae were immediately processed. The resulting four samples were divided into subsamples and used for cultivation, vPCR, and nanopore sequencing. \nFor viability determination by culture, subsamples (approximately 1e7 IFU) were used to infect four glass coverslips (13 mm in diameter, ThermoScientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in 24-well plates (TPP Techno Plastic Product AG, Trasadingen, Switzerland) seeded to confluence with LLC-MK2 cells [57]. For the “viable” subsamples, a 1:1000 dilution was performed prior to inoculation. The infection was then enhanced by centrifugation for 1 h at 25°C (1000 x g). After 48 h of incubation at 37°C (5% CO₂), cultures were fixed for 10 min in ice-cold methanol. If cultures were free of chlamydiae, one well was scraped and transferred to fresh monolayers up to three times to confirm negativity as described [58]. Coverslips were then processed using a well-established immunofluorescence assay [59]. Briefly, DNA was stained with 1 μg/mL 4', 6-diamidino-2’-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA). In parallel, inclusions were labeled with a Chlamydiaceae-specific primary antibody (Chlamydiaceae LPS, Clone ACI-P; Progen, Germany), which was diluted 1:200  in blocking solution consisting of 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, St. Louis, MO, USA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, GIBCO, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Inclusions were visualized with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:500 in blocking solution. As a final step, coverslips were washed with PBS, mounted with FluoreGuard (Hard Set; ScyTek Laboratories Inc., Logan, UT, USA) on glass slides, and inclusions determined using a Leica DMLB fluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and a 10X ocular objective (Leica L-Plan 10x/ 25 M, Leica Microsystems). In parallel, a three-fold dilution series of the sample was performed in 96-well plates (TPP) and processed as above. The number of IFU/ml for the whole samples was then calculated based on the number of inclusions detected using the Nikon Ti Eclipse epifluorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) at a 20X magnification [57].\nFor vPCR, subsamples (approximately 2e7 IFU) were taken and mixed with 200 µl SPG and 100 µl PMA enhancer for Gram Negative Bacteria (5X, Biotium, Fremont, CA, USA). PMAxx (Biotium) at a final concentration of 50 µM was added (“PMA-treated”) or not (“untreated”) to the subsamples. Samples were then exposed to a 650-W light source using a PMA-Lite LED Photolysis Device (Biotium) for 5 min, followed by 2 min on ice and additional light exposure for 5 min [48]. For vPCR as well as nanopore sequencing (subsamples with approximately 5e8 IFU), DNA was extracted using the DNeasy® Blood and Tissue Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The amount of chlamydial DNA was quantified with a sensitive C. suis qPCR [60], based on a standard curve with recombinant plasmid containing the amplicon target and calculated for the whole sample. For subsequent nanopore sequencing of the DNA extracts (viable: 13–16 ng/μL; dead: 1.9–2.8 ng/μL), we followed the same approach as described for E. coli above. Each viable sample was sequenced using one barcode (input volume of 10 μL) and each dead sample using three barcodes (input volume of 30 μL). Sequencing reads were processed following the same steps used for the E. coli dataset. Chimeric reads were identified using the 'pi' tag added by Dorado and removed with the pysam Python package. Adapter and barcode trimming was performed using Porechop, and taxonomic classification was conducted with Kraken2 v2.1.4, retaining only reads classified as Chlamydia. \nTo generate data from a simple mock community, a carbenicillin-susceptible E. coli strain and an ESBL-producing Klebsiella oxytoca strain (ATCC 700324) were cultured on Müller-Hinton (MH) agar at 37 °C for 20 hours in two biological replicates. Susceptibility to penicillin as an approximation of carbenicillin resistance was confirmed by VITEK2 and growth curve analysis at 100 and 200 ng/μL. Species identity was confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS and MLST. Cultures were inoculated at OD600 = 0.01 in 10 mL MH broth and incubated for 5 hours. Carbenicillin (200 ng/μL) was added during logarithmic growth, followed by 20 hours of further incubation. DNA was extracted directly from 250 μL of uncentrifuged culture using the same DNA extraction approach as described for UV-exposed E. coli. \nTo generate clean training data for an antibiotic exposure-specific model, two biological replicates of the same E. coli strain were used. For the viable samples,  DNA was extracted from centrifuged pellets (4000 × g, 10 min) before antibiotic treatment, respectively. For the dead samples, DNA was extracted from the filtered supernatant (0.2 μm) 20 hours after carbenicillin exposure using the same DNA extraction approach as described for UV-exposed E. coli. Nanopore sequencing and data processing were done as described for E. coli above.\nTo train ResNet model with UV-treated Escherichia coli, raw nanopore signals were segmented into chunks of 10,000 data points to create balanced 'dead' and 'alive' datasets, resulting in 1,940,000 chunks per class. These were split into training (1,164,000 chunks per class), validation (388,000), and test (388,000) sets, following a 60%-20%-20% ratio.\nFor read-level inference analysis, we used the original reads corresponding to the test set chunks. After excluding chimeric reads and those not mapped to the Escherichia genus by Kraken2, the final test set included 59,171 'alive' reads and 72,207 'dead' reads. An independent read-level dataset was also prepared from UV-treated Chlamydia suis to evaluate the UV-E. coli model, using the same preprocessing steps (exclusion of chimeric reads and reads unmapped to the genus level). This dataset included two barcodes per class, totaling 54,853 'alive' reads and 23,073 'dead' reads. The UV-E. coli model was further evaluated on two biological replicates (BR1 and BR2) of a quasi-mock community comprising carbenicillin-susceptible Escherichia coli and carbenicillin-resistant Klebsiella oxytoca. After preprocessing, the dataset included 479,494 'dead' E. coli reads and 1,945,621 'alive' K. oxytoca reads.\nTo train a ResNet model on antibiotic-treated, filtered Escherichia coli (non-mock community), raw nanopore signals were segmented into chunks of 5,000 data points to create balanced 'dead' and 'alive' datasets, yielding 275,000 chunks per class. The data were split into training (165,000 chunks per class), validation (55,000 per class), and test (55,000 per class) sets, following a 60%-20%-20% ratio. For read-level inference, the antibiotic-treated E. coli model was tested using the full reads that contributed to test set chunks. After mapping the chunks back to their originating reads, the test set comprised 5,218 'alive' reads and 44,563 'dead' reads. Additionally, the model was evaluated on a held-out, biological replicate of E. coli (non-mock community), yielding 273,896 'dead' reads and 1,639,456 'alive' reads. Finally, the model was also evaluated on the antibiotic-treated quasi-mock community that was mentioned before.\nThis data has not been previously used by any other research.",

Experimentally verified lncRNA–disease associations were obtained from LncRNADisease v3.0, while lncRNA sequence data were sourced from the NCBI nucleotide repository. Disease semantic information was extracted using ontology identifiers from the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), with semantic similarity scores calculated using the doSIM function in R. lncRNA–target associations were integrated from NPInter v4.0, and disease–gene associations were derived from the DISEASES database.\n\nAfter comprehensive filtering and mapping, the curated dataset consisted of 4365 lncRNAs, 467 diseases, and 13,335 gene-derived entities (including protein, miRNA, and mRNA targets). A total of 4579 positive lncRNA–disease associations were included. An equal number of negative samples were constructed by randomly pairing lncRNAs and diseases with no known evidence of association, resulting in a balanced binary classification dataset of 9398 data points. These datasets are widely recognized in the biomedical community and have been employed in several prior studies on lncRNA–disease association prediction.",
    "splits": "To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, we employed stratified 5-fold cross-validation on the complete dataset of 9398 samples. This approach ensured an even distribution of positive (known lncRNA–disease associations) and negative (randomly generated, non-associated) samples in each fold. In every iteration, 80% of the data was used for training and 20% for testing. Stratification was explicitly applied to maintain class balance across all folds, reflecting the overall distribution in both training and test subsets.\n\nA separate static validation set was not used outside the cross-validation framework. Instead, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation were all performed within the cross-validation loop, a standard practice when working with balanced but limited datasets.\n\nWhile we did not perform formal statistical tests on feature distribution across splits, we carried out extensive exploratory data analysis using similarity matrices and visualizations. Heatmaps of k-mer frequencies, Levenshtein distances, disease semantic similarity, gene–gene interaction profiles, and other associations were examined to confirm the diversity and consistency of features across subsets. These visual checks helped ensure that data distributions were well-represented and structurally preserved within each fold.",
    "redundancy": "The dataset was partitioned using stratified 5-fold cross-validation, and each fold was independently constructed to prevent data leakage between training and test sets. Specifically, no known lncRNA–disease association used for training was allowed to appear in the test set of the same fold. This ensured that test predictions were based solely on unseen examples.\n\nAlthough we did not apply explicit sequence-level redundancy reduction such as limiting pairwise identity between lncRNAs or between diseases, careful curation was conducted to exclude duplicate entries and entities lacking key information (such as sequences or ontology identifiers). Furthermore, sequence similarity-based features (k-mer, Levenshtein) and ontology-based measures (semantic similarity) were included in the feature space to help the model learn nuanced relationships while preserving representation diversity.\n\nThe distribution of data and association types in our dataset is comparable to other published LDA (lncRNA–disease association) machine learning datasets. However, unlike many earlier studies, our model integrates multiple layers of biological information and incorporates both sequence-level and semantic data, which enhances the richness and reliability of the training and evaluation pipeline.",

Furthermore, our web server PrediLnc, which implements the GARNET architecture, provides real-time access to model predictions and supports user-uploaded queries for novel lncRNA or disease inputs.

    "provenance": "The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was obtained from publicly available databases such as STRING (source of string_net.txt), which is widely recognized and used in bioinformatics research. Node features were generated by performing PCA on a processed TCGA gene expression dataset (cancer_full_expression_pc50.csv) that was compiled and curated by previous studies from the TCGA public resource. Class labels indicating essential (positive) and non-essential (negative) genes were obtained from a summary file from DepMap, a widely used database. The dataset includes 2,299 essential genes (Npos) and 10,723 non-essential genes (Nneg). It is designed for classification tasks and does not contain real-valued outputs for regression. While the cancer_full_expression_pc50.csv feature file was generated in this study, it is from direct transformation of TCGA expression matrix, which is widely used in the cancer research community.",
    "splits": "We employed a stratified 5-fold cross-validation strategy to evaluate model performance. 80% of the data were allocated for training and 20% for testing. Within the training subset, 90% was used for final training and 10% for validation, which was utilized for model tuning and early stopping. Although the original label data consist of 2,299 essential genes (Npos) and 10,723 non-essential genes (Nneg), the actual number of genes involved in training varies depending on the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, as not all genes are present in every network. For instance, in the STRING network, only a subset of genes is retained after filtering based on network inclusion.\n\nGiven that non-essential genes outnumber essential genes by more than fourfold, and that the number of available genes varies across networks, direct training would suffer from a class imbalance problem, potentially resulting in poor predictive performance on the minority (essential) class. To mitigate this, we adopted a resampling strategy whereby, for each training, validation, and test split, all essential genes were included alongside randomly selected non-essential genes at a 1:4 ratio. Using the STRING network as an example, this procedure yielded 6,048 genes in the training set, 972 in the validation set, and 1,680 in the test set. Because the splits were dynamically generated in each fold, we did not plot the distributions explicitly, but the stratification process guarantees that the class balance is consistent across training, validation, and test sets.",
    "redundancy": "The dataset was split using stratified 5-fold cross-validation to ensure independence between training and test sets in each fold. Specifically, genes were partitioned so that no gene appeared in both training and test sets within the same fold, thus maintaining non-overlapping sets. Similar to our approach, other gene classification methods such as EMOGI and MTGCN (both used as benchmark methods in this study) also employ cross-validation strategies to split data into training and test sets. Cross-validation provides a robust framework for performance evaluation by ensuring that each sample is tested while maintaining independence between training and testing data within each fold. This approach is widely used in the community for gene-level prediction tasks, especially when datasets are limited in size or exhibit class imbalance. Therefore, our use of stratified cross-validation aligns with established practices in similar studies.",

After PCA, we applied min-max scaling to normalize node feature values to a [0, 1] range. For each gene, its expression-based feature vector was combined with its topology in the PPI network to provide the input for the graph neural network.

For example, under the STRING network setting, the training set contains around 6,000 genes. We only use 50 node features so our model does not fall into the regime where f > 100. To prevent overfitting, we applied several strategies, including stratified cross-validation, early stopping based on validation performance, dropout, and L2 regularization. These techniques help the model generalize effectively. Conversely, to avoid underfitting, we tuned the model’s complexity (e.g., number of layers and hidden channels). The consistent results across validation folds suggest that the model's capacity is appropriate for the task.",

    "provenance": "The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was obtained from publicly available databases such as STRING (source of string_net.txt), which is widely recognized and used in bioinformatics research. Node features were generated by performing PCA on a processed TCGA gene expression dataset (cancer_full_expression_pc50.csv) that was compiled and curated by previous studies from the TCGA public resource. Class labels indicating essential (positive) and non-essential (negative) genes were obtained from a summary file from DepMap, a widely used database. The dataset includes 2,299 essential genes (Npos) and 10,723 non-essential genes (Nneg). It is designed for classification tasks and does not contain real-valued outputs for regression. While the cancer_full_expression_pc50.csv feature file was generated in this study, it is from direct transformation of TCGA expression matrix, which is widely used in the cancer research community.",
    "splits": "We employed a stratified 5-fold cross-validation strategy to evaluate model performance. 80% of the data were allocated for training and 20% for testing. Within the training subset, 90% was used for final training and 10% for validation, which was utilized for model tuning and early stopping. Although the original label data consist of 2,299 essential genes (Npos) and 10,723 non-essential genes (Nneg), the actual number of genes involved in training varies depending on the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, as not all genes are present in every network. For instance, in the STRING network, only a subset of genes is retained after filtering based on network inclusion.\n\nGiven that non-essential genes outnumber essential genes by more than fourfold, and that the number of available genes varies across networks, direct training would suffer from a class imbalance problem, potentially resulting in poor predictive performance on the minority (essential) class. To mitigate this, we adopted a resampling strategy whereby, for each training, validation, and test split, all essential genes were included alongside randomly selected non-essential genes at a 1:4 ratio. Using the STRING network as an example, this procedure yielded 6,048 genes in the training set, 972 in the validation set, and 1,680 in the test set. Because the splits were dynamically generated in each fold, we did not plot the distributions explicitly, but the stratification process guarantees that the class balance is consistent across training, validation, and test sets.",
    "redundancy": "The dataset was split using stratified 5-fold cross-validation to ensure independence between training and test sets in each fold. Specifically, genes were partitioned so that no gene appeared in both training and test sets within the same fold, thus maintaining non-overlapping sets. Similar to our approach, other gene classification methods such as EMOGI and MTGCN (both used as benchmark methods in this study) also employ cross-validation strategies to split data into training and test sets. Cross-validation provides a robust framework for performance evaluation by ensuring that each sample is tested while maintaining independence between training and testing data within each fold. This approach is widely used in the community for gene-level prediction tasks, especially when datasets are limited in size or exhibit class imbalance. Therefore, our use of stratified cross-validation aligns with established practices in similar studies.",

This approach incorporates computationally inferred protein-protein interactions as sparsity priors, reducing memory from quadratic to manageable levels while maintaining biological relevance\n\nThe method enables processing entire viral genomes (up to 61,000 aa) on a single commodity GPU while capturing long-range inter-protein dependencies missed by existing approaches.",

The putative protein-protein interactions are inferred separately for each genome fragment using the same computational method (attention-based scoring).

Additionally, proteins from non-pathogenic organisms to humans  were included from NCBI. MMseqs2 (version 15.6f452) was used to obtain a set of dereplicated protein sequences. We acknowledge that, although there is no standard for creating negative datasets, they play a crucial role in influencing model performance. Therefore, to improve the quality of our “non-toxin” dataset, potential ARGs, VFs (with high probability), and toxins were filtered out of the “non-pathogenic” dataset using PathoFact 1.0 predictions. The “non-toxin” consists of 213,130 non-redundant protein sequences. To create the “non-VF” dataset for the ML VF model, we filtered out any potential VFs (with high and low probabilities), ARGs, and toxins based on PathoFact 1.0 predictions from the “non-pathogenic” dataset. This resulted in a dataset consisting of 41,774 VF protein sequences. \n\nPositive datasets:\nFor the toxin related dataset curated training data was obtained from SwissProt, filtered for bacterial (taxonomy_id 2), archaeal (taxonomy_id 2157), fungal (taxonomy_id 4751) and viral (taxonomy_id 10239) toxin sequences (KW-0800, toxin). The dataset was supplemented with entries from toxin-specific databases such as the Toxin Exposome Database (T3DB), which catalogues bacterial protein toxins; the Database for Bacterial ExoToxins (DBETH); TADB version 3.0, which includes protein sequences of bacterial toxin–antitoxin (TA) pairs from types I to VIII; sequences from SecReT6, encompassing T6SS gene cluster components, T6SS regulator (T6SR), accessory proteins (T6SA), effectors (T6SE), and immunity proteins (T6SI); and the prokaryotic antimicrobial toxins (PAT) database. MMseqs2 (version 15.6f452) was used to dereplicate the dataset of 1,112,357 protein sequences (100% identity and coverage), yielding 213,363 unique protein sequences, corresponding to the “toxin-related” dataset. \n\nFor the VF dataset, training data was derived from SwissProt, selecting sequences annotated with the virulence keyword (KW-0843) and expanded using the Virulence Factor Database (VFDB).

The MALDI-TOF mass spectra used in this project were originally published as part of the study by Weis et al. [2].
