  "dataset/provenance": "New cohort of 524 enrolled patients, 988 mammography images divided in 494 malignant and 494 benign masses.Data was preprocessed to be useful for DL work.  An additional validation set from another hospital is also used (58 patients). Not used before",
  "dataset/redundancy": "No stratification effort",

  "optimization/encoding": "Five preprocessing steps to prepare mammography images (identification of ROI, image and size normalisation, and data augmentation (flipping and rotations). Image size was  224x224x3 ",
  "optimization/features": "Handcrafted (455), clinical (5) and DL-based features (1024-dimensional vector) are used in the final classifier. MRMR is used for feature selection, reducing the number of features to 30 Hcr and 27 DL features, next to the clinical ones.",
  "optimization/fitting": "There are 7x744 datapoints for training, yet this seems still limited given the complexity of the DL network to extract features. Not considering the DL, and only the SVM, things look better as the feature set is reduced to 62 features in total, so f > p.",
  "optimization/meta": "Yes, for the DL feature extraction the VGG16 image-net trained network was used in combination with the Inception-V3 network into a fusion network.",
  "optimization/parameters": "The DL has its weights and layers next to the epoch, learning rate, momentum and weight decay parameters.  All parameters for the fusion network were transferred rom VGG16 and Inception V3 into a DL fusion network.  They added three additional FC layers.",
  "optimization/regularization": "SVM hyperparameters were tuned with grid-search and 10-fold cross-validation.  Tests were performed in an independent set and verified in an independent validation set.  Yet no stratification seems to be done.",
