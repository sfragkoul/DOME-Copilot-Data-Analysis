  "dataset/provenance": "The data is all curated from the NCBI RefSeq database. There are 173,666, 99,945, 28,081 data points for the three GO categories, MF, BP, and CC, repectively (three sub-tasks). The minimum positive points of each label is set to 50. Because we formulate the plasmid protein function prediction as a multi-class, multi-label classification on 377 labels (172 MF labels + 174 BP labels + 31 CC labels), we can't show all the detailed number of positive/negative points for the 377 binary classifications here. However, you can check more detailed information from the Supplementary Figure S3 in the manuscript. Because we manually curated the dataset based on the RefSeq database, the protein sequences and their GO annotations are very reliable.",
  "dataset/splits": "There are three sub-tasks for our tool, namely the GO term classifications on the MF, BP, and CC categories, respectively. The detailed training/validation/test ratios for the three sub-tasks are 99,806/56,491/17,369, 60,143/29,768/10,034, and 21,228/4,045/2,808. You might find that the splitting ratio is not fixed, because we curated this dataset by simulating the novel protein function prediction scenario. Specifically, for each GO category, we allocated 10% of the most recently released proteins with GO annotations as the test set. Additionally, we ensure that the novel test set significantly differs from the training set in terms of protein sequences. Therefore, among the remaining 90% annotated proteins, those lacking significant alignments (E-value>1e-3) to the test set were assigned to the training set, while others were assigned to the validation set. This splitting strategy poses significant challenges for both PlasGO. Because of the large number of the binary classifications (377), we can't plot all the distributions. However, the data type distributions are roughly consistent for the training, validation, and test sets.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "As described above, the generated test set can serve as a novel protein set compared to the training set. Specficially, the minimum normalized edit distances between the training set and the test set for most of the labels are larger than 0.7 (as shown in Supplementary Figure S4 in the manuscript).",
  "dataset/availability": "You can access to the curated RefSeq dataset with the link http://zenodo.org/records/14005015 (dataset.tar.gz), which is licensed under the CC0 license.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "We employed deep learning in our tool. PlasGO consists of three sub-modules, a pre-trained protein language model, a global BERT model, and a classifier module incorporating a self-attention confidence weighting mechanism. The core part of PlasGO is the BERT model to learn the global context within plasmid sentences. We used the BERT model because we formuated plasmids as a language defined on the protein token set, and BERT is one of the state-of-the-art language models.",
  "optimization/meta": "No. There is no data from other ML algorithms as input to PlasGO.",
  "optimization/config": "Yes, you can check PlasGO's default models (models.tar.gz) via the Zenodo repository [14005015] at http://zenodo.org/records/14005015, which is licensed under the CC0 license.",
  "optimization/encoding": "We employed the powerful foundation protein languange model, ProtTrans, to encode our input protein sequences. It can generate biologically meaningful embedding for each plasmid-encoded protein. Then, the raw input embeddings can greatly improve the performance of GO term prediction through transfer learning. ",
  "optimization/features": "As described in V.3, the only input is the plasmid protein amino acid (AA) sequences. Then, ProtTrans is employed to generate the raw embeddings for each protein (preprocessing). By capturing the\nsemantic meaning of individual AA tokens and their contextual relationships within the protein sequence, ProtTrans will generate per-protein embeddings (1024 dimensions) as the input to the subsequent BERT module.",
  "optimization/fitting": "We have 89,835 plasmid sentences in total for training the simplified global BERT model with token classification task. As shown above, the simplest BERT model (CC) have hyperparameter of hidden_size=512, head_num=8, and layer_num=2. The corpus size (89,835) is sufficient to fit the BERT module. In addition, there are several overfitting strategies in the PlasGO models, which will be listed in V.7.",
  "optimization/parameters": "The parameter number is 13340504 for MF model, 13698908 for BP model, and 6891070 for CC model. Actually, the three models are all simple BERT models with hidden_size = 512, head_num = 8. Besides, we used 4 Transformer layers for MF and BP, and 2 Transformer layers for CC, considering the relatively smaller dataset size and label size for CC.",
  "optimization/regularization": "Yes. 1) Dropout layers adopted on both the classifier FC layer and also the attention blocks in the BERT model. 2) Validation set is employed to prevent overfitting. 3) Layer Normalization is employed for each Transformer block and also the token embedding layer. 4) A rank regularization method is utilized in the classifier module to promote the ability of the model to distinguish low-confidence and high-confidence predictions. For more details, please check the Supplementary Section S1.  ",
  "model/interpretability": "The model is interpretable. We mainly interpreted the global BERT module of PlasGO by comparing the raw embeddings generated from the ProtTrans model and the contextualized embeddings from the global BERT module. You can check the results from Figure 7 in the manuscript. The results showed thats suggests that PlasGO effectively captures the latent features associated with plasmid-specific functions.",
  "model/output": "Classification.",
  "model/duration": "The running speed of PlasGO is very fast. For the 365 plasmid proteins in the example data, it only took 1m48s for the GO term prediction on one NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. ",
  "model/availability": "Yes. You can refer to the GitHub repository https://github.com/Orin-beep/PlasGO for most recent updates. Licensed under the MIT license.",
  "evaluation/method": "We conducted a series of rigorous experiments to evaluate the performance of PlasGO. All of them can be checked in the manuscript's Results part. Specifically, they include 1) the performance on the novel RefSeq test set, 2) two ablation studies for validating PlasGO\u2019s design rationale, 3) visualization of the PlasGO embeddings for interpreting the BERT module, 4) identification of elusive GO term labels to improve the precision of PlasGO, 5) labels of different frequencies and confidence scores which show the performance stability on different labels and the effectiveness of the learned confidence scores, 6) application: automatic GO prediction for unannotated plasmid-encoded proteins in RefSeq, which pre-annotates high-confidence GO terms for all available plasmid proteins (678,197), 7) case study: annotations for two well-studied conjugative plasmids associated with AMR.",
  "evaluation/measure": "We used the two commonly used metrics in the CAFA challenge, namely the protein-centric Fmax and the term-centric AUPR. For more details of the two metrics, please refer to the \"Experimental setup\" section in the manuscript.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "Because the RefSeq test set we curated is to simulate the novel protein function prediction scenario, we didn't include any alignment-based tools for benchmarking, such as Diamond and BLASTP. Additionally, we conducted the benchmarking experiments with six learning-based state-of-the-art tools, including DeepGOPlus, PFresGO, TALE, DeepSeq, TM-Vec, and CaLM. For a fair comparison, we retrained all of them using our curated RefSeq dataset (training/validation/test). The results showed that PlasGO performed the best on all three GO categories (Figure 6 in the manuscript).",
  "evaluation/confidence": "No. The two evaluation metrics do not relate to confidence intervals. For more details, please refer to the CAFA challanges.",
  "evaluation/availability": "Yes, you can check the dataset used for benchmark experiments via the Zenodo repository [14005015] at http://zenodo.org/records /14005015."
