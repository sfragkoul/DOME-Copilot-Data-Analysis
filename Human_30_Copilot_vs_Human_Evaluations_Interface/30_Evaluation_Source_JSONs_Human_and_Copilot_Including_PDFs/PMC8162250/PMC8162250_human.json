  "dataset/availability": "Two DNA methylation datasets GSE88929 and GSE102177 with clinical information were downloaded from the GEO database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). Splits are noted in the text and use of the dataset data points for test, training and validation.\n\nTable S3 provided in supplementary data contains the sample information of the training set and testing set in the GSE88929 datasets.",
  "dataset/provenance": "Data source: GEO database\n\nDatat type: DNA methylation data\n\nAcronym note: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)\n\nTwo DNA methylation datasets GSE88929 and GSE102177 with clinical information were downloaded from the GEO database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). Both datasets were measured by the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip assays. \n\n-GSE88929 dataset: contained 68 umbilical cord blood samples from the newborns of mothers with GDM and 64 controls without GDM [12]. \n\n-GSE102177 dataset: consisted of the peripheral blood samples from 18 fullsibling pairs that were exposed to different conditions of intrauterine hyperglycemia (GDM pregnancy or non-GDM pregnancy). Therefore, there were 18 samples with exposure to maternal GDM and 18 controls without exposure to GDM in the GSE102177 dataset [23].",
  "dataset/redundancy": "Little information on redundancy reduction methods for the data splits in the text.\n\nLikely based on the text, the test and training were kept separate.",
  "dataset/splits": "Authors randomly separated the samples from GSE88929 into the training set and testing set, containing 66 samples.\n\nTable S3 provided in the supplementary data contains the sample information of the training set and testing set in the GSE88929 datasets.\n\nData points:\n-Test: 66 samples.\n-Training: 66 samples.\n\nThe samples from GSE102177 were instead used as an independent validation set. This contained: 18 samples.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "Support vector machine (SVM) ML algorithm - this is not a new algorithm.\n\nWhy chosen: \n-Previous SVM model usage success for prognosis and diagnosis of disease, such as diabetes mellitus.\n-Previous successful use and application of SVMs for GDM research.\n-Novelty of usage for CpG methylation biomarkers.",
  "optimization/config": "No - no configuration available. Little info in text on these model optimisation info points.",
  "optimization/encoding": "No clear information of how the SVM input data was encoded. \u03b2-values of CpG sites from the data seem to have been used but no further information on how these were encoded.",
  "optimization/features": "Input features, (f) = 6 \n\n\u03b2-values of CpG sites used as features: text notes using the \u03b2-values of 6 CpG sites for model development. These \u03b2-values directly represent the features that were used in the model for classification.\n\nYes: feature selection was performed to determine these 6x.",
  "optimization/fitting": "Fitting not clearly addressed in the text, very little information on optimising the fit to avoid over-/under- fitting case for the SVM model. Parameter size unkown but most likely somewhat larger than features used. Small number of features used (f=6). Training set size is not very large, only 66. ",
  "optimization/meta": "No",
  "optimization/parameters": "Parameters used for the SVM ML model are unclear.\n\nIn the simplest case there was potentially 6 parameters used based on the 6x CpG sites noted and their \u03b2-values for the model. However, given the model type there it is very likely there were more than 6x parameters used. e.g. kernel function or tuned hyperparameters.",

  "model/interpretability": "Black box - no model source code linked in a repository (No GitHub/Zenodo/other). Dataset info for the training and test set is available in supplementary file. Less clear for separate valdation dataset. Very poor model optimisation information in the text/suppl. files which is also heavily contributing to black box model nature.  ",

  "evaluation/comparison": "No - no clear indication of comparison to other methods using benchmark datasets. Authors did note this was a novel usage of SVM for this classification task meaning there may not have been other methods to compare to.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "No confidence intervals noted in the text related to the SVM model performance.",
  "evaluation/measure": "Limited performance measures reported in the text.\n\nArea Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) was used as the primary performance metric for the SVM model in the GDM study.\n\nReported Values: AUC values for three datasets:\n-Training Set (GSE88929): AUC = 0.8138\n-Testing Set (GSE88929): AUC = 0.7576\n-Independent Validation Set (GSE102177): AUC = 0.6667\n\nAdditional performance measure metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score could also be used and are absent from the text/related files.",
