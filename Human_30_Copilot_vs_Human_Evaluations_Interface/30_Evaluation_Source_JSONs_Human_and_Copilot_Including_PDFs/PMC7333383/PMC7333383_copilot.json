  "dataset/provenance": "The datasets used in our study primarily originate from the Buenrostro Lab, including GM12878 and K562 data from Buenrostro et al., Nature 2015, and hematopoietic differentiation data from Buenrostro et al., Cell 2018, and Corces et al., Nature Genetics 2016. These datasets were generated using the Fluidigm platform, which involves isolating individual cells and creating libraries in each cell chamber. This method provides high coverage and low sparsity but at the cost of lower throughput compared to more recent technologies.\n\nAdditionally, we included data from Cusanovich et al., Cell 2018, which was generated using a different platform. To demonstrate the versatility of our method, we also analyzed a 10x Genomics scATAC-seq dataset on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). This dataset features a more complex clustering structure, showcasing SCATE's effectiveness on high-throughput platforms.\n\nThe datasets from the Buenrostro Lab have been widely used in the community, providing a robust foundation for our analyses. The inclusion of the 10x Genomics dataset further validates our method's applicability across different sequencing technologies.",
  "dataset/splits": "In our study, we utilized several datasets to evaluate the performance of SCATE. The primary datasets included GM12878 and K562 cells, which were analyzed both separately and as mixtures to simulate heterogeneous cell populations. Additionally, we included hematopoietic differentiation data and a dataset from Cusanovich et al., which involved mouse brain and thymus cells.\n\nFor the GM12878 and K562 cells, we created synthetic samples with different cell mixing proportions. Specifically, we generated 10 synthetic samples for each mixing proportion, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of SCATE's performance across various cell type compositions. This approach allowed us to assess the method's ability to detect and cluster cells accurately, even when the true underlying labels were unknown.\n\nIn addition to these datasets, we also analyzed a 10x Genomics scATAC-seq dataset from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). This dataset presented a more complex clustering structure, providing a rigorous test of SCATE's capabilities on high-throughput platforms. The results demonstrated that SCATE outperformed other methods, highlighting its robustness and versatility.\n\nFurthermore, we conducted benchmark analyses against existing scATAC-seq methods, including Dr.seq2, scABC, Cicero, Scasat, cisTopic, and Destin. These comparisons were performed using default parameters to ensure fairness and were presented in Figure 5 and additional supplementary figures. The benchmarking process involved evaluating the performance of each method across different datasets and cell types, providing a comprehensive assessment of SCATE's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nOverall, our dataset splits included a mix of homogeneous and heterogeneous cell populations, as well as data from different sequencing platforms. This diverse set of datasets allowed us to thoroughly evaluate SCATE's performance and demonstrate its effectiveness in various scenarios.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "In our study, we utilized a variety of datasets to evaluate the performance of SCATE. The datasets were chosen to reflect both homogeneous and heterogeneous cell populations, mimicking real-world scenarios where true cell type labels are often unknown.\n\nFor homogeneous cell populations, we analyzed datasets such as GM12878 and K562 separately. These datasets were generated using high-coverage methods, providing detailed information with less sparsity. This approach allowed us to demonstrate the basic functionality of SCATE on well-defined cell types.\n\nTo simulate more realistic conditions, we also created mixtures of GM12878 and K562 cells, as well as other cell types like mouse thymus and brain. In these analyses, we intentionally did not use the true cell type labels, pretending they were unknown. This mimicked the challenges faced in real-world applications where cell type labels are not available a priori. The cells were computationally clustered into relatively homogeneous subpopulations, and each cluster was analyzed as if it were a single cell type. This approach helped us evaluate how SCATE performs in the presence of noise and mixed cell types.\n\nAdditionally, we analyzed more complex datasets, such as human hematopoietic differentiation data and human PBMC 10x Genomics scATAC-seq data. These datasets are heterogeneous, consisting of multiple cell types, and reflect the reality that unsupervised cell clustering may not perfectly separate cells originating from different cell types. Our results showed that SCATE outperformed other methods in these realistic settings.\n\nTo ensure the independence of training and test sets, we removed cell types that appeared in the scATAC-seq data from the BDDB. This ensured that the CREs constructed using BDDB did not include cell types involved in the scATAC-seq data, providing a reliable evaluation of SCATE's performance on new datasets. This approach is similar to cross-validation techniques used in machine learning, where the model is trained on one set of data and tested on an independent set to avoid overfitting and ensure generalizability.\n\nThe distribution of our datasets compares favorably to previously published machine learning datasets in the field of single-cell genomics. Our datasets include a mix of high-coverage and more recently generated combinatorial indexing and 10X Genomics data, providing a comprehensive evaluation of SCATE's performance across different data types and complexities. This ensures that our findings are robust and applicable to a wide range of real-world scenarios.",

Additionally, the data splits used in our analysis are clearly documented, allowing other researchers to replicate our results and build upon our work.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our work is designed to adaptively tune the analysis resolution in single-cell ATAC-seq data. It falls under the class of cross-validation techniques, which are widely used in machine learning for model selection and parameter tuning.\n\nThe algorithm is not entirely new; it builds upon established principles of cross-validation but is tailored specifically for the unique challenges posed by single-cell ATAC-seq data. The core idea is to automatically determine the optimal number of cis-regulatory element (CRE) clusters by leveraging the data itself, without relying on external gold standards during the tuning process.\n\nThe reason this algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that its primary innovation lies in its application to biological data rather than in the development of a novel machine-learning technique. The focus of our work is on improving the resolution and accuracy of single-cell ATAC-seq analysis, which is a biological problem. The algorithm's effectiveness is demonstrated through its ability to handle the complexities of single-cell data, such as high noise levels and the intrinsic difficulty of separating cell types.\n\nIn summary, while the algorithm uses standard cross-validation methods, its implementation and application to single-cell ATAC-seq data represent a significant contribution to the field of computational biology.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model SCATE integrates multiple types of information to reconstruct activities of individual cis-regulatory elements (CREs) from single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) data. It leverages co-activated CREs, similar cells, and publicly available regulomic data. The precompiled list of CRE clusters, derived from a large number of DNase-seq samples representing diverse cell types, provides information about which CREs are correlated. This correlation information is used as a prior to help infer CRE activities in new scATAC-seq data.\n\nSCATE does not directly use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it uses a hierarchical model that combines information from co-activated CREs and public bulk regulome data. The model adaptively optimizes the analysis resolution based on the available data, balancing the need to pool CREs for robust signal detection against the desire to retain CRE-specific information.\n\nThe precompiled CRE clusters contain information about CRE correlations learned from diverse cell types. This information is transferred to the new scATAC-seq data to help infer CRE activities. However, the actual activity levels of CREs in the new data are inferred using the scATAC-seq read counts, ensuring that the training data is independent. The correlation information serves as a regularization to improve the estimation of CRE activities by reducing variance and introducing a controlled bias.\n\nIn summary, SCATE is not a traditional meta-predictor that combines outputs from multiple machine-learning methods. Instead, it uses a hierarchical model that integrates prior knowledge from public data with new scATAC-seq data to reconstruct CRE activities. The independence of the training data is maintained by using the scATAC-seq read counts to infer actual CRE activities.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, data encoding and preprocessing were crucial steps to ensure the effective application of our machine-learning algorithm, SCATE. We began by defining signal bins in each DNase-seq sample, which are essential for identifying regions of interest in the genome. A bin was considered a \"signal bin\" if it met specific criteria: the raw signal (yi,j) had to be at least 10, the normalized signal (\u02dcyi,j) had to be at least 5, and the normalized signal had to be at least five times (or three times for mouse data) larger than the background signal in the surrounding 100 kb region. These cutoffs were chosen to filter out noisy genomic loci, which could otherwise increase the computational burden and potentially lead to inaccurate results.\n\nThe criteria for defining signal bins can be generalized as (1) yi,j \u2265 a, (2) \u02dcyi,j \u2265 b, and (3) \u02dcyi,j is at least c times the background signal. The default cutoff combinations were set to (a, b, c) = (10, 5, 5) for human data and (a, b, c) = (10, 5, 3) for mouse data. These defaults were determined through an extensive exploration of different cutoff combinations to optimize performance.\n\nTo ensure that the data used for parameter selection were independent of the test data, we used only bulk DNase-seq samples from the BDDB database. We excluded any samples whose cell types were involved in our test scATAC-seq data. The remaining samples were randomly partitioned into a training set and a validation set. The training samples were used to identify signal bins using various cutoff combinations, and SCATE was applied to these training samples. For each validation sample, 10,000 reads were randomly sampled to simulate a scATAC-seq cell, and SCATE was applied to reconstruct CRE activities. The performance was evaluated using the Pearson correlation between the SCATE output and the true bulk DNase-seq profile.\n\nThis preprocessing and encoding strategy allowed us to systematically explore the impact of different cutoff combinations on the performance of SCATE. We found that the default cutoffs provided the best balance between signal reconstruction performance and computational feasibility. This approach ensured that our machine-learning algorithm could effectively analyze the data and provide reliable results.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our model, the number of parameters, p, varies depending on the cluster number K and the specific aspects of the model being considered. The model includes several key components that contribute to the total number of parameters.\n\nFirstly, the locus effects mi and si are learned from bulk data. These effects are specific to each cis-regulatory element (CRE) and are used to model the baseline activity of CREs. The number of these parameters is equal to the number of CREs, I.\n\nSecondly, the model includes a cluster membership matrix, where each entry xik is a binary variable indicating whether CRE i belongs to cluster k. The number of parameters in this matrix is I * K.\n\nAdditionally, the model includes the common activity \u03b2k,j for all CREs in cluster k. The number of these parameters is K.\n\nThe technical bias is modeled using a cell-specific monotone function hj(.), which is estimated using monotone splines. The number of parameters in this function depends on the number of knots T used in the spline basis functions.\n\nThe observed read count yi,j is modeled using a Poisson distribution with mean Lj\u03bcsc i,j, where Lj is a cell-specific normalizing factor. This component does not introduce additional parameters beyond those already mentioned.\n\nThe cluster number K is treated as a tuning parameter and is adaptively chosen based on available information to optimize the analysis's spatial resolution. This is done using a cross-validation approach that balances spatial resolution and estimation uncertainty.\n\nIn summary, the total number of parameters p in the model depends on the number of CREs I, the cluster number K, and the number of knots T used in the spline basis functions for the technical bias. The specific value of p is determined by the chosen values of K and T, which are selected to optimize the model's performance.",
  "optimization/features": "The input features for our analysis are derived from bulk DNase-seq data, specifically from the signal bins identified in each sample. These signal bins are defined using three criteria: (1) the raw signal value must be at least a certain threshold, (2) the normalized signal value must meet another threshold, and (3) the normalized signal value must be significantly higher than the background signal in the surrounding region.\n\nThe default cutoff combinations for defining these signal bins are (a, b, c) = (10, 5, 5) for human data and (a, b, c) = (10, 5, 3) for mouse data. These cutoffs were chosen to filter out noisy genomic loci, which helps to reduce the computational burden and improve the performance of our method, SCATE.\n\nFeature selection was performed to determine the optimal cutoff combinations for identifying signal bins. This process involved exploring different cutoff values that were computationally feasible. The selection was done using a training set of bulk DNase-seq samples, ensuring that the data used to choose parameters were independent of the test data used to evaluate SCATE's performance on scATAC-seq. The training samples were used to identify signal bins using various cutoff combinations, and SCATE was run on these training samples to evaluate performance.\n\nThe performance was assessed by simulating scATAC-seq cells from the validation samples and computing the Pearson correlation between SCATE's output and the true bulk DNase-seq profile. This procedure was repeated for different cutoff combinations, and the mean correlation difference across all validation samples was computed for each combination. The default cutoff combinations were found to provide the best performance in terms of signal reconstruction.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in our approach involves adaptive tuning of the analysis resolution based on the available data. This method is designed to balance the need for pooling enough data to robustly distinguish biological signals from noise while avoiding overfitting or underfitting.\n\nIn our analysis, the number of parameters, specifically the number of CRE clusters (K), is treated as a tuning parameter. This parameter is adaptively chosen using a cross-validation procedure, which helps to determine the optimal K based on the sparsity of the data. When the data is highly sparse, a smaller K is chosen, allowing information to be shared among a larger number of CREs. This approach sacrifices some CRE-specific information to achieve higher estimation precision, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting. Conversely, when the data is less sparse, a larger K is chosen, retaining more CRE-specific information and avoiding underfitting.\n\nTo rule out overfitting, we ensured that the cross-validation procedure effectively evaluated the model's performance on unseen data. This involved splitting the data into training and validation sets multiple times and computing the mean correlation difference across all validation samples for each cutoff combination. The results showed that using looser or more stringent cutoff combinations reduced signal reconstruction performance, confirming that the chosen cutoff values were optimal and not overfitted to the training data.\n\nSimilarly, to rule out underfitting, we explored various cutoff combinations and found that none of the alternative combinations improved performance. This indicated that the default cutoff values provided a good balance between model complexity and performance, ensuring that the model was not too simplistic to capture the underlying patterns in the data.\n\nIn summary, our fitting method adaptively tunes the analysis resolution to prevent both overfitting and underfitting, ensuring robust and accurate signal reconstruction.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our results. One key approach was the use of cross-validation to adaptively tune the analysis resolution. Specifically, we used cross-validation to automatically choose the number of CRE (cis-regulatory element) clusters. This method involved pooling different numbers of cells and applying SCATE to the pooled data to determine the optimal cluster number. By repeating this procedure multiple times, we obtained an empirical distribution of the cluster number chosen by SCATE, which helped in identifying the most appropriate cluster number without relying on external gold standard data.\n\nAdditionally, we explored various cutoff combinations to evaluate their impact on signal reconstruction performance. For both human and mouse data, we tested different cutoff values and observed that neither looser nor more stringent cutoff combinations improved performance. This analysis helped us justify the use of the default cutoff values presented in the main article, ensuring that our results were not overly fitted to specific parameter settings.\n\nFurthermore, we conducted benchmarks and comparisons with existing methods to validate the effectiveness of our approach. These comparisons included evaluating regulome reconstruction performance using different metrics, such as correlation between reconstructed and true bulk log-CRE activities, peak calling AUC, and correlation between predicted and true differential log-CRE activities. These benchmarks provided additional evidence that our method was robust and not prone to overfitting.\n\nIn summary, our use of cross-validation for adaptive tuning, exploration of different cutoff combinations, and comprehensive benchmarking with existing methods collectively ensured that our results were reliable and not the product of overfitting.",
  "optimization/config": "The source code for our tool, SCATE, is publicly available under the MIT License. This can be accessed on GitHub at the following link: https://github.com/zji90/SCATE. The specific version of the source code used in our manuscript has been deposited in Zenodo, a DOI-assigning repository, and can be found at: https://zenodo.org/record/3711558#.Xm6OIC2ZPRY. This link is also provided in the Availability of Data and Materials section of our manuscript.\n\nRegarding the hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters, these details are discussed within the manuscript. Specifically, we have explored various cutoff combinations for both human and mouse data. For human data, the default cutoffs used are (a, b, c) = (10, 5, 5). We tested looser and more stringent cutoff combinations, such as (8, 4, 4) and (12, 6, 6), respectively, and found that these did not improve performance. Similar analyses were conducted for mouse data with default cutoffs of (a, b, c) = (10, 5, 3). Other cutoff combinations, including (8, 4, 2) and (12, 6, 4), also did not enhance signal reconstruction performance. These findings are supported by additional figures, such as Fig. S14, which provide further details on the performance evaluations.\n\nAll relevant information, including the source code, cutoff combinations, and performance analyses, is thoroughly documented in the manuscript and supplementary materials. This ensures transparency and reproducibility of our results.",
  "model/interpretability": "The SCATE model is designed with a focus on interpretability, making it more transparent than many black-box models. This transparency is achieved through several key strategies that allow users to understand and interpret the results effectively.\n\nOne of the primary ways SCATE ensures interpretability is by integrating data from similar CREs (cis-regulatory elements) and cells. This integration helps in reconstructing CRE activities from sparse data, providing a clearer picture of the regulatory landscape. By leveraging publicly available regulome data, SCATE enriches the analysis with well-established biological information, making the results more interpretable in a biological context.\n\nAdditionally, SCATE adaptively optimizes the analysis resolution based on the available data. This adaptive approach allows the model to adjust its complexity and detail level, ensuring that the results are both comprehensive and understandable. Users can systematically characterize the regulatory landscape of a heterogeneous sample through unsupervised identification of cell subpopulations and reconstruction of their chromatin accessibility profiles at the single CRE resolution.\n\nThe model's transparency is further enhanced by its coupling with cell clustering methods. While the default implementation uses model-based clustering, users have the flexibility to choose other clustering methods. This adaptability ensures that the clustering results are interpretable and align with the specific needs of the analysis. For example, in the analysis of human PBMCs from the 10x Genomics platform, SCATE grouped cells into clusters that could be unambiguously linked to cell types, providing a clear and interpretable clustering result.\n\nMoreover, SCATE's performance in regulome reconstruction is thoroughly evaluated and visualized. For instance, the correlation between reconstructed and true bulk log-CRE activities, peak calling AUC, and correlation between predicted and true differential log-CRE activities are all presented. These evaluations provide clear metrics for assessing the model's performance and interpretability.\n\nIn summary, SCATE's unique strategy of integrating data from similar CREs and cells, leveraging regulome data, and adaptively optimizing analysis resolution makes it a transparent and interpretable model. The flexibility in cell clustering methods and comprehensive performance evaluations further enhance its interpretability, making it a valuable tool for analyzing scATAC-seq data.",
  "model/output": "The output of our model, SCATE, is the estimated regulome profile for each cell subpopulation. This profile represents the reconstructed activities of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) at a single-CRE resolution. The model is primarily focused on regression tasks, as it aims to predict continuous values of CRE activities rather than classifying them into discrete categories.\n\nSCATE processes single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) data to provide a detailed map of chromatin accessibility across the genome. For datasets containing multiple cells, SCATE first clusters the cells into subpopulations using a method similar to SCRAT. This clustering helps in identifying relatively homogeneous cell groups. After clustering, SCATE estimates the regulome profile for each cell cluster by pooling reads from all cells in the cluster to create a pseudo-cell. The model then applies its single-cell analysis to this pseudo-cell to estimate CRE activities.\n\nThe output includes a moving average approach to call peaks from the reconstructed regulome profile. This involves calculating a moving average signal for each 200 bp bin, which helps in identifying regions of high chromatin accessibility.\n\nIn summary, SCATE's output is a set of estimated regulome profiles for each identified cell subpopulation, providing insights into the regulatory landscape of heterogeneous samples. The model's focus is on reconstructing continuous CRE activities, making it a regression-based approach.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time for our model, SCATE, can be broken down into several stages. Initially, compiling CREs (Cis-Regulatory Elements) and clustering them typically takes around 1-2 days. This process is computationally intensive and requires a significant amount of resources, specifically a computer with 10 computing cores (2.5GHz CPU/core) and a total of 20GB RAM.\n\nOnce the CRE list and their clustering structure are established, running SCATE to reconstruct the regulome is much faster. This step takes approximately 5 minutes per cell cluster. This efficiency is particularly notable when using the precompiled CRE list and clusters from the BDDB (Bulk DNase-seq DataBase), as it allows users to skip the tedious and computationally heavy steps of CRE detection and clustering. This makes SCATE(BDDB) substantially easier to use compared to SCATE(BDDB+User Data), which requires users to download and process DNase-seq data themselves.",
  "model/availability": "The source code for SCATE is publicly available under the MIT License. It can be accessed and downloaded from GitHub. The specific version of the source code used in the manuscript has been deposited in Zenodo, a DOI-assigning repository, ensuring that the exact code used for the research is preserved and accessible. The link to this specific version is provided in the manuscript.\n\nThe software is implemented as an R package, which can be installed directly from GitHub. This makes it accessible to a wide range of users who are familiar with the R programming environment. Additionally, the package has been submitted to Bioconductor, a popular repository for R packages in bioinformatics, and is currently under review. Once approved, it will be available through Bioconductor, further increasing its visibility and accessibility.\n\nThe software includes detailed user manuals and example data, which are also available on GitHub. This includes markdown files that provide step-by-step instructions for running the software, making it easier for users to get started. The software supports loading peak calls instead of BAM files, providing flexibility in the types of input data that can be used.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of SCATE was conducted through a comprehensive analysis involving multiple datasets and comparison with existing methods. Initially, SCATE was tested on datasets from the Buenrostro Lab, including GM12878 and K562 cells, as well as hematopoietic differentiation data. These datasets were generated using Fluidigm, which provides high coverage but lower throughput.\n\nTo address concerns about the generalizability of SCATE, additional analyses were performed on a 10x Genomics scATAC-seq dataset from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). This dataset features a more complex clustering structure, and SCATE demonstrated superior performance compared to other methods, even on platforms with higher throughput.\n\nThe evaluation also included a detailed benchmarking process. SCATE was compared against various existing scATAC-seq methods, including raw reads methods like Dr.seq2 and scABC, and binary methods such as Cicero, Scasat, cisTopic, and Destin. These comparisons were conducted using default parameters for each method, ensuring a fair assessment. The results, presented in figures and additional files, showed that SCATE consistently outperformed these methods in capturing cell heterogeneity and differential signals.\n\nFurthermore, the evaluation relied on bulk signals due to the difficulty in obtaining single-cell resolution gold standards. SCATE's performance was assessed by comparing reconstructed scATAC-seq signals from single cells or pooled cells to bulk DNase-seq or ATAC-seq signals. This approach allowed for a robust evaluation of SCATE's ability to capture cell differences and heterogeneity.\n\nIn summary, SCATE was evaluated through a rigorous process involving multiple datasets, comparisons with existing methods, and a focus on capturing cell heterogeneity and differential signals. The results demonstrated SCATE's superior performance and reliability in studying cell heterogeneity.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our method, we focus on several key performance metrics to assess the effectiveness of our approach in reconstructing regulome activities. These metrics are chosen to provide a comprehensive understanding of our method's performance and are aligned with those commonly reported in the literature.\n\nOne of the primary metrics we use is the correlation between reconstructed and true bulk log-CRE (cis-regulatory element) activities. This metric helps us understand how well our method can replicate the actual regulatory activities observed in bulk data. We report this correlation for both default analyses and when using user-specified cluster numbers.\n\nAnother crucial metric is the peak calling AUC (Area Under the Curve). This metric evaluates the ability of our method to accurately identify peaks in the data, which are indicative of active regulatory regions. We report the peak calling AUC for different methods and conditions, providing a clear comparison of their performance.\n\nAdditionally, we assess the correlation between predicted and true differential log-CRE activities. This metric is essential for understanding how well our method can capture changes in regulatory activities under different conditions or cell types. We report this correlation for various analyses, including default settings and user-specified cluster numbers.\n\nThese performance metrics are representative of those used in the literature for evaluating regulome reconstruction methods. By reporting these metrics, we aim to provide a transparent and comprehensive evaluation of our method's performance, allowing for easy comparison with other existing methods.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In the evaluation of SCATE, a comprehensive comparison with publicly available methods was conducted on benchmark datasets. The comparison included various methods such as chromVAR, SCRAT, BROCKMAN, Dr.seq2, Cicero, Scasat, Destin, scABC, PRISM, and cisTopic. These methods were evaluated based on their ability to cluster cells, identify regulatory elements, and reconstruct activities of individual cis-regulatory elements (CREs) from single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) data.\n\nThe evaluation involved multiple datasets, including those from the Buenrostro Lab and a 10X Genomics scATAC-seq dataset on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The performance of SCATE was assessed against these methods using various metrics, such as correlation with bulk signals, peak calling AUC, and the ability to capture cell-type-specific signals. SCATE demonstrated superior performance in capturing both cell-type-specific and shared signals between different cell types, as illustrated in Figure 5. Additionally, systematic comparisons in Figures 6-9 showed that SCATE robustly performed among the best across different sampling scenarios.\n\nFurthermore, simpler baselines were also considered. For instance, methods that use raw reads or binary data were compared. SCATE outperformed these baselines, especially when pooling multiple cells into pseudobulk samples, indicating its robustness and reliability in reconstructing scATAC-seq signals. The evaluations were conducted using default parameters for each method to ensure a fair comparison. The results highlight SCATE's effectiveness in studying cell heterogeneity and its ability to accurately capture differences among cells.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our method, SCATE, includes systematic comparisons with other methods using various performance metrics. To assess the confidence in our results, we employed several statistical approaches.\n\nFirstly, we computed the Pearson correlation between the scATAC-seq signals reconstructed by each method and the gold standard bulk signals across all cis-regulatory elements (CREs). This analysis was repeated ten times using ten independent cell samplings for each cell number, and we reported the median performance. This approach provides a robust measure of the correlation's stability and reliability.\n\nSecondly, we performed peak calling using the reconstructed signals and evaluated the performance using sensitivity versus false discovery rate (FDR) curves. The area under the curve (AUC) was computed for each method, and the median AUC from multiple runs was compared. This metric gives a clear indication of each method's ability to accurately identify true peaks while minimizing false positives.\n\nAdditionally, we explored the impact of different cutoff combinations on signal reconstruction performance. For both human and mouse data, we found that using cutoff combinations looser or more stringent than our default values reduced performance. This analysis was conducted across all validation samples, and the mean correlation difference was computed for each cutoff combination, providing a statistical measure of the default cutoffs' superiority.\n\nIn our evaluations, SCATE consistently outperformed other methods, showing the strongest correlation with bulk gold standards and the best peak calling performance. The statistical significance of these results was assessed through repeated sampling and median performance reporting, ensuring that our claims of SCATE's superiority are well-founded.",
