  "publication/title": "Merizo: a rapid and accurate protein domain segmentation method using invariant point attention",
  "publication/doi": "10.1038/s41467-023-43934-4",
  "publication/year": "2023",
  "publication/tags": [],
  "dataset/availability": "The code and network weights of Merizo are available at https://github.com/psipred/Merizo",
  "dataset/provenance": "The PDB chains and domain annotations used for training were accessed from version 4.3 of the CATH database.\nThe final training and testing set contained 17,287 and 663 chains respectively.\nTo fine-tune the model, 7502 and 1195 AFDB-human models were used for the training and testing sets, respectively",
  "dataset/redundancy": "Further redundancy filtering with CD-HIT39 was performed to cluster targets which had a sequence identity of greater than 99%.",
  "dataset/splits": "The authors devised a training-test split which did not overlap at the CATH homologous superfamily (H) level  to better gauge performance on folds that the network has not seen before.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The model is a deep neural network.\nIt is not a novel algorithm.",
  "optimization/config": "The model is accessible through https://github.com/psipred/Merizo",
  "optimization/encoding": "The model takes three inputs: a single representation, pairwise representation and backbone frames. The single representation is produced by one-hot encoding the primary sequence into 20 amino acid classes and then projected into 512 feature dimensions. For the pairwise representation, authors used the pairwise distance map derived from alpha carbons, directly embedded into 32 feature dimensions as continuous values using a linear layer. Finally, the Euclidean backbone frames are calculated from each residue \u201cframe\u201d (N-CA-C atoms) via Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization.",
  "optimization/features": "The model takes 3 inputs with varying feature dimensions.",
  "optimization/fitting": "P is much larger than the number of training points. The authors devised a training-test split which did not overlap at the CATH homologous superfamily (H) level  to better gauge performance on folds that the network has not seen before.",
  "optimization/meta": "It is not a meta-predictor.",
  "optimization/parameters": "The model is a small encoder-decoder network with approximately 37 M parameters (20.4 M in the encoder and 16.8 M in the decoder).",
  "optimization/regularization": "No",
  "model/availability": "It will be incorporated into the PSIPRED workbench at http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/",
  "model/duration": "Average time per target (second) on GPU: 0.112",
  "model/interpretability": "The model is a deep neural network with 37 M parameters, rendering it a black box.",
  "model/output": "The model has elements of both classification and regression tasks.",
  "evaluation/availability": "No",
  "evaluation/comparison": "The benchmark compares the accuracy of domain assignments by Merizo against those produced by four recently published methods including DeepDom, a CNN-based method from Eguchi et al (referred to as Eguchi-CNN), SWORD and UniDoc.\nThey also included four baseline measures, including scoring ECOD assignments against CATH (where ECOD assignments are treated as a prediction result), and three random assignment methods prefixed with\u2019Random\u2019, where the domain count is estimated according to the Domain Guess by Size method.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "Yes, confidence intervals are reported. Merizo is the most performant method on the CATH-663 set when scoring by IoU. It is followed closely by UniDoc, which has a wider distribution.",
  "evaluation/measure": "They scored predictions based on (1) how well the residues in a predicted domain overlap with a true domain, measured via the intersect-over-union (IoU) between residues in the predicted and\nground-truth domain, and (2) how precise the predicted domain boundaries are, when assessed using the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC).",
  "evaluation/method": "They evaluated the model on a test split which did not overlap at the CATH homologous superfamily (H) level with the training set.\nNo mention was made of cross-validation."
