  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was generated from live-cell imaging experiments focusing on the localization of GFP-tagged proteins, specifically GFP-Parkin and GFP-TFEB. The images were acquired using a Nikon Ti-2 CSU-W1 spinning disk confocal system equipped with a high-speed electron-multiplying charge-coupled device camera. The cells were seeded at a density of 105 cells per well on a two-well Lab-Tek chamber slide.\n\nFor the GFP-TFEB localization classification, a training set composed of 107,226 single-cell example images was produced. Of these, 80% were used for training the convolutional neural network (CNN) model, 15% for validation, and the remaining 5% for testing the model's performance. The images were standardized to an input size of 150 pixels by 150 pixels.\n\nThe dataset includes images of cells under various conditions, such as starvation and expression of specific sgRNAs targeting genes like TGFBR1, CREB5, PPP1R1B, and mTOR. These images were used to train and validate models for classifying subcellular localization patterns.\n\nThe flow cytometry data from the TFEB screen, including gating examples and codes, are available on GitHub. Additionally, statistical power analysis and filtered read counts are provided in the same repository. The dataset has been used to develop and validate both Support Vector Machine (SVM) and CNN models for phenotype classification.\n\nThe performance of the models was evaluated using precision-recall curves, and the accuracy of the segmentation procedure was compared with manual segmentation using the Nikon Imaging System elements imaging software. The dataset and associated codes are publicly available, allowing for reproducibility and further analysis by the scientific community.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was split into two unique groups: a test set and a training image set. This procedure was iterated 100 times, ensuring that each observation was used in the training or test set only once. The dataset consisted of approximately 5,000 single-cell images. The accuracy of the classification model was evaluated on the test set after fitting the model on the training set. The performance was calculated by area under the precision-recall curve to prevent overfitting. The final classifier accuracy was reported to be 99%.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "Not enough information is available.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data and code used in our study are publicly available. The flow cytometry data from the TFEB screen, including gating examples and codes, can be accessed on GitHub.

  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used is Support Vector Machines (SVM), specifically a nonlinear SVM algorithm. This algorithm is not new; it is a well-established method in the field of machine learning. The choice to use SVM was driven by its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional spaces and its ability to perform well with a clear margin of separation between classes.\n\nThe SVM algorithm was applied to create a classification model for distinguishing subcellular phenotypes, particularly focusing on the localization of GFP-Parkin. The model was optimized through iterations, with performance evaluated using the area under the precision-recall curve. To prevent overfitting, the data was shuffled and split into training and test sets, with the procedure repeated 100 times to ensure robustness.\n\nThe decision to use SVM in this context was likely influenced by its proven track record in similar biological classification tasks. While the algorithm itself is not novel, its application in this specific biological context contributes to the broader field of computational biology and bioinformatics. The focus of the publication is on the biological insights gained from the application of this machine-learning technique, rather than the development of a new algorithm. Therefore, it is published in a journal focused on cell biology rather than a machine-learning journal.",
  "optimization/meta": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the machine-learning algorithm, data encoding and preprocessing involved several key steps. Initially, single-cell images were captured and segmented to isolate individual cells. These images were then labeled based on the specific phenotype of interest, such as the localization of GFP-Parkin or GFP-TFEB. Features were computed from these images using image processing techniques. For GFP-Parkin, 18 features were initially considered, but only five were selected based on their distinct variation: the 5% intensity quantile, the standard deviation of intensity, minimum radius, eccentricity, and area. These selected features were then used to train a nonlinear support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. To prevent overfitting, the data was shuffled and split into training and test sets multiple times, ensuring that each observation was used only once in either set. For the convolutional neural network (CNN) model used for GFP-TFEB localization, images were resized to 150 pixels \u00d7 150 pixels. Data augmentation techniques, such as random brightness adjustments, were applied to account for variations in fluorescence signal intensity. The images were then divided into training, validation, and testing sets, with 80%, 15%, and 5% of the data respectively. This preprocessing ensured that the models were trained on a diverse and representative dataset, enhancing their ability to generalize to new data.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized a radial basis function (RBF) kernel for our support vector machine (SVM) model. The RBF kernel has a single parameter, \u03b3, which controls the width of the Gaussian function. This parameter is crucial as it influences the model's ability to fit the data.\n\nThe selection of \u03b3 was done through an iterative process aimed at optimizing model performance. We performed multiple iterations, calculating the performance using the area under the precision-recall curve or the receiver operating characteristic curve, depending on the phenotype representation. This approach helped in preventing overfitting by ensuring that the model generalized well to unseen data.\n\nFor the convolutional neural network (CNN) model, several hyperparameters were tuned, including the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs. The learning rate was set to 1e-4, the batch size to 200, and the training was conducted over 50 epochs. These parameters were chosen based on empirical testing and validation to achieve the best performance on the training and validation datasets.\n\nAdditionally, data augmentation techniques, such as random brightness adjustments, were applied to account for variations in fluorescence signal intensity, further enhancing the model's robustness. The final model was selected from the epoch where both the training and validation loss curves showed no further decrease, indicating optimal performance without overfitting.",
  "optimization/features": "In the optimization process of our model, we initially computed 18 features from single-cell images. To enhance the model's performance and reduce computational cost, we performed feature selection. This selection was based on distinct variations observed in the data. Specifically, we chose five cellular features: the 5% intensity quantile, the standard deviation of intensity, minimum radius, eccentricity, and area. These selected features were then used as input for our nonlinear support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to create the classification model. The feature selection process was conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the model's performance on the test set remained unbiased.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed two distinct machine learning models: a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). For the SVM, we utilized a radial basis function kernel with a cost violation of 10. To optimize the model, we performed multiple iterations and evaluated performance using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve or the precision-recall curve, depending on the phenotype representation. To prevent overfitting, we shuffled the featured data and split it into training and test sets, iterating this process 100 times to ensure each observation was used only once in either set. This approach helped in validating the model's generalizability and robustness.\n\nFor the CNN model, we used an ImageNet architecture with TensorFlow and Keras. The training set consisted of 107,226 single-cell images, with 80% used for training, 15% for validation, and 5% for testing. The model underwent 50 epochs with a batch size of 200, and overfitting was mitigated by saving model weights after each epoch and selecting the model from the epoch where both validation and training loss curves plateaued. Additionally, we applied brightness augmentation to the training images to account for variations in fluorescence signal intensity.\n\nTo address the potential for underfitting, we ensured that our models were sufficiently complex to capture the underlying patterns in the data. For the SVM, the radial basis function kernel allowed for non-linear classification, which is crucial for capturing complex relationships in the data. For the CNN, the architecture included multiple convolutional and max-pooling layers, enabling the model to learn hierarchical features from the images. The use of a validation set during training also helped in tuning hyperparameters and ensuring that the model was not too simplistic to capture the necessary patterns.\n\nIn summary, our approach involved rigorous validation techniques, including cross-validation for the SVM and careful monitoring of loss curves for the CNN, to ensure that our models were neither overfitting nor underfitting the data.",
  "optimization/regularization": "To prevent overfitting, several techniques were employed during the optimization process. For the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, the data was shuffled and split into unique training and test sets, with this procedure iterated 100 times to ensure each observation was used only once in either set. This approach helped in evaluating the model's performance more robustly.\n\nFor the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, overfitting was mitigated by using built-in Keras callbacks to save model weights after each epoch. The model was selected from the epoch where both validation and training loss curves showed no further decrease. Additionally, data augmentation techniques, such as randomly applying brightness adjustments to the training images, were used to account for variations in fluorescence signal intensity. This ensured that the model generalized well to new, unseen data.\n\nThe performance of the models was also monitored by plotting performance values against iterations, which helped in identifying and preventing overfitting. The use of precision-recall curves and area under the curve (AUC) metrics provided a comprehensive evaluation of the models' accuracy and robustness.",

  "model/interpretability": "The models employed in our study, specifically the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), are largely considered black-box models. This means that while they can provide accurate predictions, the internal decision-making processes are not easily interpretable.\n\nThe SVM model, for instance, uses a radial basis kernel to classify phenotypes, but the specific weights and combinations of features that lead to a particular classification are not straightforward to extract or interpret. Similarly, the CNN model, which is based on an ImageNet architecture, processes images through multiple convolutional and max-pooling layers. The final phenotype decision is based on probability values, but the intermediate steps and feature extractions within the neural network are not transparent.\n\nHowever, we did implement certain measures to ensure that the models were not overfitting and to validate their performance. For the SVM, we performed iterations and calculated performance using the area under the precision-recall curve. We also shuffled the featured data and split it into training and test sets multiple times to ensure robustness. For the CNN, we used techniques such as brightness augmentation and monitored validation and training loss curves to select the optimal model epoch.\n\nWhile these steps help in validating the models' performance and generalizability, they do not make the models more interpretable. The focus was on achieving high accuracy and reliability in phenotype classification, which is crucial for our experimental goals.",
  "model/output": "The model is a classification model. It is designed to classify images based on the localization of GFP-TFEB, distinguishing between nuclear and cytosolic positions. The model uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, specifically an ImageNet-like structure, to achieve this classification. The output of the model is a probability value that indicates the likelihood of GFP-TFEB being in the nucleus or cytosol. A high probability value corresponds to nuclear GFP-TFEB, while a low probability value indicates cytosolic GFP-TFEB. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as the precision-recall curve and the area under the curve (AUC), which provide a measure of the model's accuracy in classifying the images correctly. The model was trained on a dataset of single-cell images, with a portion of the data used for training, validation, and testing to ensure robust performance and generalization.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time for our models varied depending on the specific tasks and the hardware used. For the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, the training process involved iterations to optimize performance, with each iteration's performance evaluated using the area under the precision-recall curve. This iterative process helped prevent overfitting and ensured robust model performance. The exact time for these iterations is not specified, but it was managed efficiently to avoid excessive computational overhead.\n\nFor the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, training was conducted over 50 epochs with a batch size of 200. The images used for training were 150 pixels by 150 pixels, and the model included three steps of convolution and max pooling. The learning rate was set at 1e-4. To mitigate overfitting, model weights were saved after each epoch using the built-in Keras callbacks API. The final model was selected from the epoch where both the validation and training loss curves showed no further decrease. This approach ensured that the model generalized well to unseen data.\n\nThe live-image acquisition and model deployment for both SVM and CNN were performed on specialized microscopy systems. For the SVM deployment, a Nikon Ti-2 CSU-W1 spinning disk confocal system was used, equipped with a high-speed electron-multiplying charge-coupled device camera. The process involved real-time capture and segmentation of images, with the SVM model deployed on-the-fly. The entire process was iterated across more than 1,000 fields of view, ensuring comprehensive coverage.\n\nFor the CNN-based screen, live-cell image acquisition and deployment were performed on an Eclipse Ti2-E microscope with a CSU-W1 spinning disk system. The TensorFlow deployment script ran a backend \"while-loop\" throughout the acquisition, facilitating real-time processing. The environmental control chamber maintained optimal conditions for the cells during imaging.\n\nIn summary, while specific execution times for individual components are not detailed, the models were designed and optimized for efficient performance. The use of advanced microscopy systems and real-time processing ensured that the models could handle large datasets and provide accurate classifications in a timely manner.",

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the method involved several steps to ensure its accuracy and reliability. Initially, a nonlinear SVM algorithm was used to create a classification model with selected features and labeled cell images. To optimize the model, iterations were performed, and performance was calculated using the area under the precision-recall curve. To prevent overfitting, the data was shuffled and split into training and test sets, with the procedure repeated 100 times to ensure each observation was used only once in either set. The classifier achieved an accuracy of 99% on approximately 5,000 single-cell images.\n\nThe segmentation procedure's accuracy was compared to the gold standard manual segmentation using the Nikon Imaging System (NIS) elements imaging software. The intersection over union was calculated to evaluate the segmentation, showing very similar scores to those obtained with CellProfiler.\n\nThe performance of phenotype classification and sorting of photoactivated cells was evaluated separately. dCas9-KRAB was expressed and tested in U2OS cells expressing photoactivatable mCherry (pa-mCh) and GFP-Parkin. To calculate the sorting accuracy, cells blocked for Parkin recruitment were mixed with wild-type cells in varying ratios. The photoactivation process involved illuminating cells with specific laser parameters to ensure accurate activation and minimize unwanted effects.\n\nAdditionally, a graphical user interface was developed to facilitate image segmentation, measurement, and model building. This interface allowed for real-time capture and analysis of live-cell images, generating masks to identify cells with the desired phenotype. The photoactivated samples were then sorted using flow cytometry and deep sequenced to determine sgRNA abundance.\n\nThe CNN model's performance was assessed using a precision-recall curve, where the area under the curve measured accuracy. The model was trained on a dataset of single-cell images, with 80% used for training, 15% for validation, and 5% for testing. Overfitting was prevented by saving model weights after each epoch and selecting the model with the best validation performance. The CNN model showed higher performance than the SVM model, likely due to differences in the segmentation step and handling of uneven illumination in the training set.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed several performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of our classification models. For the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, we primarily used the area under the precision-recall curve to assess performance. This metric is particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets, which is common in biological data. Additionally, we calculated accuracy scores and used confusion matrices to provide a detailed breakdown of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. These metrics allowed us to understand the model's ability to correctly classify cells exhibiting the desired phenotype, such as GFP-Parkin mitochondrial localization.\n\nFor the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, we also utilized the precision-recall curve to measure accuracy. Furthermore, we implemented a validation set during training to tune hyperparameters and detect overfitting. The final model performance was evaluated using a separate testing set, ensuring that the model's generalizability was assessed. We also compared the intersection over union of our segmentation procedure with established methods like CellProfiler to validate the accuracy of our image segmentation.\n\nThe use of precision-recall curves and confusion matrices is representative of standard practices in the field, especially when dealing with classification tasks in biological imaging. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of the model's performance, including its sensitivity and specificity, which are crucial for reliable phenotypic classification. The inclusion of validation and testing sets further ensures that our models are robust and can be applied to new, unseen data.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we compared the performance of two different machine learning models: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM).

We employed a cross-validation procedure where the data was shuffled and split into training and test sets 100 times to ensure robust performance evaluation.\n\nBoth models were assessed on the same testing dataset to compare their ability to accurately predict the true class labels of cell images. The CNN model demonstrated higher performance, which we speculate may be due to the segmentation step that introduced uneven illumination in the training set.\n\nWhile we did not compare our methods to publicly available benchmarks or simpler baselines, our internal comparison between the CNN and SVM models provided valuable insights into their respective strengths and weaknesses. The CNN model's superior performance suggests its potential for more accurate classification tasks in similar biological imaging contexts.",

We conducted power calculations using the R package PROPER to estimate the statistical power of differential guide read count data from the negative binomial distribution. This allowed us to determine the appropriate sample sizes and the number of repeats needed for our studies, which were chosen to be 3, 5, 7, and 9. The power was calculated for effect sizes ranging from 0.1 to 5 with an \u03b1 nominal of 0.15, similar to the false discovery rate used in our current study.\n\nFor the SVM classification model, we performed iterations and calculated performance using the area under the precision-recall curve.
