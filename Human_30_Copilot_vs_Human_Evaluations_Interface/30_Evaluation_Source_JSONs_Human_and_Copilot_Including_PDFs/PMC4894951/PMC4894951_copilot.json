  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our work leverages ideas from statistical physics and machine learning to address the inverse problem of learning stochastic reaction-diffusion processes from data. The core of our approach is the connection between stochastic reaction-diffusion processes and spatio-temporal Cox processes, a well-studied class of models in computational statistics.\n\nThe machine-learning algorithm class used is not a standard, off-the-shelf algorithm but rather a novel approach tailored to the specific challenges of stochastic reaction-diffusion processes. This algorithm is not new in the sense that it builds upon established methods in statistical physics and machine learning, but it is innovative in its application to stochastic reaction-diffusion processes.\n\nThe reason this algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that the primary focus of our work is on the application of these methods to stochastic reaction-diffusion processes, which are of significant interest in fields such as systems biology and epidemiology. The novel contribution lies in the integration of these techniques to solve a long-standing problem in computational modeling, rather than the development of a new machine-learning algorithm per se. The algorithm's effectiveness is demonstrated through its application to real-world problems, showcasing its practical utility and accuracy.",
  "optimization/meta": "Not applicable. The publication does not discuss a meta-predictor or the use of data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. The focus is on a method for parameter inference and model selection for stochastic reaction\u2013diffusion processes using a Cox process representation. The approach involves optimizing the likelihood with respect to the parameters and comparing Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) values for model selection. The method does not involve combining predictions from multiple machine-learning algorithms.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the data encoding and preprocessing, we utilized fluorescence intensity measurements obtained from the FlyEx database. These measurements were taken on a spatial grid for 17 Drosophila embryos at cleavage stage 13. The data consists of fluorescence intensity values, which represent the expression levels of the bicoid protein.\n\nTo simplify the analysis, we projected the two-dimensional data onto one dimension. This reduction allowed us to focus on the spatial distribution of the bicoid protein along the length of the embryo. The preprocessing steps involved normalizing the fluorescence intensity values to ensure consistency across different embryos and measurement conditions.\n\nThe encoded data was then used to infer the parameters of our stochastic reaction-diffusion model. The parameters included the creation range, diffusion rate, and the ratio of production to decay rates of the bicoid protein. These parameters were estimated by maximizing the likelihood of the observed data given the model.\n\nThe preprocessing and encoding steps were crucial for ensuring that the data was in a suitable format for the machine-learning algorithm. By projecting the data to one dimension and normalizing the intensity values, we were able to accurately infer the model parameters and validate the performance of our approach.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In the optimization process, the number of parameters used in the model varies depending on the specific system being analyzed.\n\nFor the gene expression system, the model includes parameters such as the diffusion rate, production rates, and decay rates for both mRNA and protein. The exact number of parameters can vary based on the complexity of the reactions being modeled.\n\nIn the case of the SIRS model, the system comprises a susceptible, an infected, and a recovered species. The model has four parameters that need to be inferred: the diffusion rate, the recovery rate, the susceptible rate, and the bimolecular infection rate.\n\nFor the Drosophila embryo data, the system has four parameters: the creation range, the diffusion rate, the production rate, and the decay rate of the bicoid protein. However, for steady-state data, not all parameters are identifiable, and only certain ratios are inferred.\n\nThe selection of parameters is driven by the specific biological or epidemiological system being modeled. The parameters are chosen based on their relevance to the dynamics of the system and the availability of data for inference. The goal is to use a parsimonious set of parameters that can accurately describe the system's behavior while avoiding overfitting.",
  "optimization/features": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our approach, the risk of over-fitting is generally low because we directly optimize the kinetic parameters of the model rather than fitting an intensity function to the observed points and then fitting the dynamics. Kinetic parameters are usually much fewer than the number of observations available. This means that the number of parameters is not much larger than the number of training points, which helps to mitigate over-fitting.\n\nTo further ensure that over-fitting is not an issue, we use a likelihood-based approach that is appropriately penalized to account for model complexity. This penalization helps to balance the fit of the model to the data with the complexity of the model, thereby reducing the risk of over-fitting.\n\nUnder-fitting is addressed by the accuracy of our method in capturing the dynamics of the system. The mean-field approximation used in our method effectively captures the complex behavior of the system, as demonstrated in the results for the Drosophila embryo bicoid data and the SIRS system. The good agreement between the experimental data and the point process approximation, along with the small residuals observed, indicates that the model is sufficiently complex to capture the underlying dynamics without being overly simplistic.\n\nAdditionally, the computational efficiency of our method allows for the inference of parameters in a reasonable time frame, even for larger systems. This efficiency ensures that the model can be thoroughly tested and validated against the data, further reducing the risk of under-fitting. The method's ability to handle spatial heterogeneity and its application to real gene expression data demonstrate its robustness and accuracy in fitting the data without under-fitting.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our approach, we directly optimize the kinetic parameters of the model rather than fitting an intensity function to the observed points and then fitting the dynamics. This method inherently reduces the risk of overfitting because kinetic parameters are typically much fewer in number than the observations available. By focusing on these parameters, we ensure that our model remains parsimonious and avoids the complexities that can lead to overfitting. Additionally, the use of a likelihood function enables us to provide a statistically meaningful, data-driven assessment of how well a model describes the data. This assessment is crucial when there is uncertainty about the precise mechanisms underlying the data, such as the exact reactions or species involved. Likelihood estimates, when appropriately penalized to account for model complexity, can then be used to select models according to their support from the data. This method ensures that our models are not only accurate but also robust and generalizable.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model presented in this work is not a black-box model. Instead, it provides a transparent and interpretable framework for understanding stochastic reaction-diffusion processes. This transparency is achieved through the Cox process representation, which establishes a clear link between microscopic, mechanistic descriptions (Stochastic Reaction-Diffusion Processes, SRDPs) and empirical, data-driven approaches (spatio-temporal point processes).\n\nOne of the key examples of this transparency is the application to the bicoid protein in Drosophila embryos. The model explicitly infers parameters such as the creation range, diffusion rate, and the ratio of production to decay rates of the bicoid protein. These parameters have clear biological interpretations and are directly related to the underlying mechanisms of protein expression and diffusion. The results show good agreement between the model predictions and experimental data, demonstrating the model's ability to capture the essential dynamics of the system.\n\nAnother example is the model selection for the SIRS (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible) system. The method uses the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to decide between two microscopic models, one with and one without spontaneous infection. The model selection process is transparent, as it relies on optimizing the likelihood with respect to the parameters and comparing the BICs of the two models. The results show that the method correctly identifies the true model in the vast majority of cases, providing a clear and interpretable way to distinguish between different underlying mechanisms.\n\nFurthermore, the dynamics of the SIRS system are visualized using an RGB image, where the color components represent the intensity fields of the three species (Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered). This visualization helps to understand how the model captures the complex behavior of a wave of infection spreading through the domain. The mean-field approximation used in the model provides a transparent way to interpret the results, as it captures the essential dynamics of the system while being computationally efficient.\n\nIn summary, the model presented in this work is transparent and interpretable, providing clear examples of how it can be used to understand complex biological and epidemiological systems. The use of the Cox process representation and the application to specific examples demonstrate the model's ability to bridge the gap between mechanistic descriptions and data-driven approaches, making it a powerful tool for inference and model selection.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this work is primarily focused on inference and model selection for stochastic reaction-diffusion processes. It is not strictly a classification or regression model in the traditional sense. Instead, it provides a framework for estimating parameters and selecting the correct model from a set of candidate models based on given data.\n\nThe model uses a Cox process representation of stochastic reaction-diffusion processes (SRDPs), which allows for the application of statistical inference methods. This representation enables the estimation of parameters and the comparison of different models using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The model is designed to handle spatio-temporal data and can be applied to various systems, such as gene expression in Drosophila embryos and epidemic spreading in populations.\n\nThe output of the model includes parameter estimates and model selection results. For example, in the case of the Drosophila embryo data, the model infers parameters such as the creation range, diffusion rate, and the ratio of production to decay rates of the bicoid protein. The model also provides predictions that can be compared to experimental data, demonstrating the accuracy of the inference method.\n\nIn summary, the model is a tool for parameter estimation and model selection in stochastic reaction-diffusion processes. It is not a classification or regression model but rather a method for inferring the underlying mechanisms and parameters of complex spatio-temporal systems.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time for our model is notably efficient. For instance, inferring four unknown parameters for the SIRS system took approximately 10 seconds on a 3.1 GHz processor. This efficiency is particularly pronounced when compared to traditional methods. Simulating a single realization of the SIRS system using Brownian dynamics simulations took about 250 seconds, which is roughly an order of magnitude longer than our entire inference procedure. This efficiency is due to our method's reliance on solving (S)PDEs, for which there exists a rich literature of efficient numerical methods. This suggests that our approach is well-suited for larger systems with more species and unknown parameters.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The method was evaluated using several approaches to demonstrate its accuracy and effectiveness. Simulated time-series data from a gene expression system was used to initially test the method. This system involved mRNA transcription, diffusion, and protein translation, with reactions modeled deterministically, corresponding to a Poisson process.\n\nFor the Drosophila embryo data, the method was applied to real gene expression data for the bicoid protein at cleavage stage 13. The data, consisting of fluorescence intensity measurements on a spatial grid, was obtained from the FlyEx database. The system was modeled by a linear birth-death process, and parameters such as the creation range, diffusion rate, and production-to-decay rate ratio were inferred. The results showed good agreement between the experimental data and the point process approximation, with residuals generally small and larger errors concentrated around regions of steeply changing gradients.\n\nModel selection was performed using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to decide between two microscopic models for an SIRS system. The method was tested under two scenarios: with and without spontaneous infection. The results indicated that the method correctly identified the true model in the vast majority of cases, demonstrating its suitability for model selection. The effectiveness was notable even when spatial heterogeneities evened out rapidly, although some mistakes occurred due to random samples of the SRDP when the infection spread particularly fast.\n\nThe method's performance was also evaluated through numerical simulations of the corresponding (S)PDEs, projected onto a finite set of spatial basis functions. This approach allowed for efficient parameter estimation by maximizing the data likelihood, reducing the risk of overfitting due to the direct optimization of kinetic parameters. The software used for these evaluations is available as supplementary data.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our evaluation, we primarily focus on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) as our key performance metric. The BIC is used to compare the goodness of fit of different models, taking into account both the likelihood of the data given the model and the number of parameters in the model. This metric is particularly useful for model selection, as it penalizes models with a larger number of parameters, thereby helping to prevent overfitting.\n\nWe report the frequency with which our method correctly identifies the true model underlying the data. This is assessed through multiple simulations and parameter sets, providing a robust measure of the method's accuracy. Specifically, we find that our approach correctly selects the true model in the vast majority of cases, demonstrating its effectiveness in model selection tasks.\n\nAdditionally, we evaluate the confidence level with which the correct model is chosen. This provides insight into the reliability of our method's predictions. The results indicate that the method often selects the correct model with a high degree of confidence, further validating its performance.\n\nWhile our primary focus is on the BIC and model selection accuracy, we also consider the agreement between the experimental data and the model predictions. This is assessed through visual comparisons and residual analysis, which show that our method provides accurate predictions that closely match the observed data.\n\nOverall, the reported metrics are representative of the literature on model selection and inference for stochastic reaction-diffusion processes. The use of the BIC is a standard approach in the field, and our evaluation provides a comprehensive assessment of the method's performance in identifying the true underlying model.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our evaluation, we compared our method to commonly used approaches for stochastic reaction-diffusion processes (SRDPs) and spatio-temporal point processes. Unlike many existing methods that rely on computationally expensive Brownian dynamics simulations or stochastic simulations of spatially discretized systems using the reaction-diffusion master equation (RDME), our approach leverages the solution of (stochastic) partial differential equations (S)PDEs. This allows us to take advantage of a rich literature of efficient numerical methods, making our method highly scalable and suitable for larger systems.\n\nWe demonstrated the efficiency of our method by comparing the computational time required for parameter inference in an SIRS system. Our method inferred four unknown parameters in approximately 10 seconds on a 3.1 GHz processor, whereas simulating a single realization of the SIRS system using Brownian dynamics took about an order of magnitude longer. This stark contrast highlights the immense computational costs associated with traditional simulation-based inference methods.\n\nFurthermore, we showed that our method can accurately discriminate between competing models using likelihood-based criteria, such as the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). This capability is crucial for model selection and structure learning in spatio-temporal stochastic systems. By providing a likelihood approximation, our approach enables the application of techniques from fields where structure learning is more established, such as learning gene regulatory networks.\n\nIn summary, our method offers a significant advantage in terms of computational efficiency and scalability compared to existing approaches. It also provides a robust framework for model selection and structure learning in complex spatio-temporal systems.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our method's performance includes an assessment of the confidence with which it selects the correct model. We employed the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to determine the true model from two scenarios: one where the true microscopic model includes a spontaneous infection reaction and another where it does not. The sign of the difference in BIC values indicates whether the correct model is selected, while the magnitude of this difference reflects the confidence level of the selection.\n\nOur results, illustrated in Figure 5, show the frequency with which our method correctly identifies the true model and the associated confidence levels. The figures combine results from 5 different parameter sets and 20 independent simulations for each set, totaling 100 experiments. In the scenario without spontaneous infection, the method correctly identified the true model in 89% of the cases, and in the scenario with spontaneous infection, it achieved 96% accuracy. Notably, in most instances, the method selected the correct model with a 'very strong' confidence level.\n\nThese findings demonstrate the robustness and reliability of our method in model selection tasks. The high accuracy and strong confidence levels indicate that our approach is well-suited for distinguishing between competing models, even in the presence of identifiability problems that can arise from similar mechanisms like spontaneous and contact infection. The method's performance is particularly impressive given the computational efficiency, as it relies on solving (S)PDEs rather than more computationally intensive simulations.",
