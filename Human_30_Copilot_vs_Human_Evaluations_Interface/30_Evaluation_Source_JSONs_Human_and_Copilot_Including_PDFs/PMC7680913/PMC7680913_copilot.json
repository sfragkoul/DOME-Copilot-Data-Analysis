  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from a clinical investigation involving patients with adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) and healthy controls (HCs). The study included a total of 90 patients with AOSD and 40 healthy controls. The training set consisted of 40 AOSD patients (23 active and 17 inactive) and 24 healthy controls. The validation set comprised 26 AOSD patients (18 active and 8 inactive) and 16 healthy controls.\n\nThe data collected included demographic and clinical information, laboratory test results, and biological samples. The systemic disease activity of each AOSD patient was assessed using a modified Pouchot\u2019s score. Biological samples were obtained under a protocol approved by the Institutional Research Ethics Committee of Ruijin Hospital in Shanghai, China. All subjects provided written informed consent.\n\nThe dataset was used to quantify cell-free DNA and NET-DNA complexes in the serum of AOSD patients. Additionally, serum levels of various interleukins (IL-1b, IL-6, IL-10, IL-18) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were measured. Support vector machines (SVM) were employed to explore the potential of circulating NETs as biomarkers for diagnosing AOSD and identifying patients refractory to low-dose glucocorticoid treatment.\n\nThe study adhered to the principles of Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. The dataset has not been previously published or used by the community in other studies.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into two main splits: a training set and a validation set. The training set included 40 patients with adult-onset Still\u2019s disease (AOSD), of which 23 were active and 17 were inactive. Additionally, the training set contained 24 healthy controls (HCs). The validation set consisted of 26 patients with AOSD, with 18 being active and 8 inactive. The validation set also included 16 healthy controls. The distribution of data points in each split was designed to ensure a representative sample of both active and inactive AOSD patients, as well as healthy controls, for both training and validation purposes.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets were split into a training set and a validation set. The training set included 40 patients with adult-onset Still\u2019s disease (AOSD) and 24 healthy controls (HCs). The validation set consisted of 26 patients with AOSD and 16 HCs. The training and validation sets were independent, ensuring that the model's performance could be evaluated on unseen data. This independence was enforced by using distinct groups of patients and controls for each set, preventing any overlap that could bias the results.\n\nThe distribution of the datasets compares favorably to previously published machine learning datasets in the context of AOSD. The training set included a balanced representation of active and inactive AOSD patients, as well as healthy controls, which is crucial for building a robust model. Similarly, the validation set maintained this balance, allowing for a thorough assessment of the model's generalizability. The inclusion of both active and inactive AOSD patients in the training set helped in capturing the variability in disease activity, which is essential for developing a reliable diagnostic tool. The validation set's independent nature ensured that the model's performance metrics, such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity, were accurate and not inflated by overfitting.",
  "dataset/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in this study is Support Vector Machines (SVM). This is a well-established and widely used class of algorithms in the field of machine learning, particularly for classification tasks.\n\nThe SVM approach implemented in this study is not a new algorithm. It is a standard method that has been extensively studied and applied in various domains, including bioinformatics and medical research. The choice of SVM for this study was likely driven by its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data and its ability to build robust predictive models.\n\nThe reason this algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that the focus of this research is on its application in the medical field, specifically in the diagnosis and monitoring of adult-onset Still\u2019s disease (AOSD). The primary contribution of this study is the demonstration of the clinical value of circulating neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) as biomarkers for AOSD, rather than the development of a new machine-learning algorithm. The SVM was used as a tool to achieve the study's objectives, which are centered around medical and biological insights rather than algorithmic innovations.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employed in this study is not a meta-predictor. It does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it relies on a support vector machines (SVM) approach to build a prediction model. The SVM model utilizes circulating NETs and clinical data from the training set to create a classifier. This model is then used to predict the class labels of samples in the validation set.\n\nThe training set included 40 patients with AOSD and 24 healthy controls, while the validation set consisted of 26 patients with AOSD and 16 healthy controls. The independence of the training data from the validation data is ensured by the study design, which separates the datasets for model training and validation purposes. This separation helps in assessing the predictive power of the model accurately.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps. Initially, demographic and clinical data were collected and entered into a database, along with laboratory test results. This data included information on patients with adult-onset Still\u2019s disease (AOSD) and healthy controls (HCs). The training set consisted of 40 AOSD patients and 24 HCs, while the validation set included 26 AOSD patients and 16 HCs.\n\nContinuous variables, such as age and laboratory measurements, were presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Categorical variables, like sex and clinical manifestations, were expressed as counts and proportions. For the machine-learning algorithm, specifically the support vector machines (SVM) approach, the data was preprocessed by implementing grid search and Gaussian radial basis function kernels for tuning parameters. This preprocessing step was crucial for optimizing the model's performance.\n\nThe circulating neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and clinical data of the patients in the training set were used to build the SVM model. Each sample in the validation set was then predicted using this model and assigned a classification label. The predictive power of the model was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, with metrics such as area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity being calculated. Overall accuracy was determined by the ratio of correctly predicted patients.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In the optimization process, the support vector machines (SVM) approach was employed to build a model using circulating NETs and clinical data of patients. The selection of parameters for the SVM model involved the implementation of grid search and Gaussian radial basis function kernels. This method was used to tune the parameters effectively. The specific number of parameters used in the model is not explicitly stated, but the process involved selecting the optimal parameters through a systematic search. The grid search method is a common technique for hyperparameter tuning, where a range of values for each parameter is specified, and the model is trained and evaluated for each combination to find the best-performing set of parameters. This ensures that the model is optimized for the given dataset and improves its predictive power.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized a comprehensive set of input features to build our predictive model. The features included both clinical data and circulating NETs signatures. Specifically, we quantified cell-free DNA and various NET-DNA complexes in the serum of patients, such as NE-DNA, MPO-DNA, and citH3-DNA. Additionally, we measured serum levels of key cytokines, including IL-1b, IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, and TNF. These biomarkers were chosen based on their known associations with disease activity and inflammation in AOSD.\n\nFeature selection was performed to ensure that only the most relevant features were included in the model. This process was conducted using the training set exclusively, adhering to best practices in machine learning to prevent data leakage and maintain the integrity of the validation process. By focusing on the training set, we aimed to build a robust model that could generalize well to new, unseen data. The selected features were then used to train a support vector machine (SVM) model, which was subsequently evaluated on an independent validation set to assess its predictive power.",
  "optimization/fitting": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed a regularization method to prevent overfitting when using support vector machines (SVM) for modeling. Specifically, we utilized grid search along with Gaussian radial basis function kernels to tune the parameters of our SVM model. This approach helped in selecting the optimal hyperparameters, which is crucial for enhancing the model's generalization ability and reducing the risk of overfitting. By carefully tuning these parameters, we ensured that our model could effectively distinguish between patients with adult-onset Still\u2019s disease (AOSD) and healthy controls, as well as identify those who were refractory to low-dose glucocorticoid treatment.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization schedule used in our study are available. Specifically, we utilized a support vector machines (SVM) approach with grid search and Gaussian radial basis function kernels for tuning parameters. The details of these configurations can be found within the methodology section of our publication. However, the model files themselves are not explicitly provided in the publication. The optimization parameters, such as those used in the SVM, are described in the context of our experimental setup and analysis.\n\nRegarding the availability and licensing, the methods and configurations described in our paper are intended for academic and research purposes. The specific tools and software used, such as MATLAB R2020a for SVM implementation and statistical software like SPSS and GraphPad Prism, have their own licensing agreements that would need to be adhered to if one were to replicate our study. The data and methods described are meant to be reproducible within the guidelines of academic research and ethical considerations.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a blackbox. It utilizes support vector machines (SVM), which are inherently interpretable models. SVM works by finding a hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space. The decision boundary created by SVM is linear in the transformed feature space, making it possible to understand how different features contribute to the classification.\n\nThe interpretability of the SVM model is further enhanced by the use of Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernels. The RBF kernel allows the model to handle non-linear relationships between features, but the decision function remains interpretable. The kernel trick transforms the data into a higher-dimensional space where a linear separator can be found, and the support vectors (the data points closest to the decision boundary) are crucial in defining this separator.\n\nIn the context of this study, the SVM model was used to distinguish between patients with adult-onset Still\u2019s disease (AOSD) and healthy controls (HCs), as well as to identify patients refractory to low-dose glucocorticoid treatment. The model's predictions are based on the levels of circulating neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and clinical data. The use of parallel coordinates plots and Andrews curves provides visual representations of how different features (such as NET-DNA complexes) contribute to the classification of AOSD patients with different responses to treatment. These visualizations help in understanding the relationships between the features and the model's predictions, making the model more transparent.\n\nAdditionally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the curve (AUC) values provide quantitative measures of the model's performance. The high AUC values indicate that the model has a good discriminative ability, and the ROC curves show the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity at various threshold settings. This information helps in interpreting the model's reliability and its potential for clinical application.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in this study is a classification model. Specifically, it utilizes support vector machines (SVM) to distinguish between different categories of patients. The SVM approach was used to classify patients with adult-onset Still\u2019s disease (AOSD) from healthy controls (HCs) and to identify those who are refractory to low-dose glucocorticoid treatment. The model assigns a classification label to each sample in the validation set, predicting whether a patient has AOSD or is refractory to treatment based on the circulating NETs signature and clinical data. The predictive power of the model is assessed using metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, sensitivity, and specificity.",

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method involved a combination of training and validation sets to assess the performance of the support vector machines (SVM) model. The training set consisted of 40 patients with adult-onset Still\u2019s disease (AOSD) and 24 healthy controls (HCs). An independent validation set was used, comprising 26 AOSD patients and 16 HCs. The SVM model was built using the circulating NETs signature and clinical data from the training set. Each sample in the validation set was then predicted using this model and assigned a classification label.\n\nThe predictive power of the model was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which provided the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity. The overall accuracy of the model was determined by the ratio of correctly predicted patients. The model exhibited excellent performance in the validation set, with an accuracy of 88.10%. The ROC analysis revealed a sensitivity of 87.5%, a specificity of 88.5%, and an AUC of 0.880. These results suggest that the circulating NETs signature could serve as a potential biomarker for diagnosing AOSD.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our study, we focused on several key performance metrics to assess the effectiveness of our model. The primary metric we reported was the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), which provides a comprehensive measure of the model's ability to distinguish between patients with adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) and healthy controls (HCs). An AUC of 0.880 was achieved, indicating strong discriminative power.\n\nIn addition to the AUC, we also reported sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity, or the true positive rate, measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified by the model. Our model achieved a sensitivity of 87.5%. Specificity, or the true negative rate, measures the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified. The specificity of our model was 88.5%.\n\nOverall accuracy, which is the ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances, was also calculated. The model exhibited an accuracy of 88.10%, demonstrating its robustness in classifying patients.\n\nThese metrics collectively provide a thorough evaluation of the model's performance. The AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy are standard metrics in the literature for assessing the performance of diagnostic models, ensuring that our evaluation is both comprehensive and comparable to other studies in the field.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "Not applicable. The study focused on the quantification of cell-free DNA and NET-DNA complexes in the serum of AOSD patients and the use of support vector machines (SVM) for diagnostic and predictive modeling. It did not involve comparisons to publicly available methods or simpler baselines on benchmark datasets. The primary emphasis was on the development and validation of the SVM model using specific clinical data and biomarkers related to AOSD.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "Evaluation Confidence\n\nThe study employed statistical methods to ensure the reliability of the results. The performance metrics, such as sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC), were assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The AUC value of 0.880 indicates a high level of discrimination between the classes. The p-values associated with the comparisons of circulating NETs levels between different groups were provided, demonstrating statistical significance. For instance, the levels of circulating NETs were significantly higher in active AOSD patients compared to healthy controls and inactive patients, with p-values ranging from <0.0001 to 0.0495. The support vector machines (SVM) model showed excellent performance in the validation set, with an accuracy of 88.10% and a p-value of <0.0001. These statistical analyses provide confidence in the robustness of the findings, suggesting that the circulating NETs signature could serve as a potential biomarker for AOSD.",
