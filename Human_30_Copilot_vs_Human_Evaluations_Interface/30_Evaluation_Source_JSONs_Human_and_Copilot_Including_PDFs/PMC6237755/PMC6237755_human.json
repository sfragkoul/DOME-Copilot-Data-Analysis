Student\u2019s t-test was performed to determine if there were any significantly different metabolites between AD, MCI, and age-matched controls (p < 0.05) when compared pairwise. Non-normally distributed data were analyzed using a Mann\u2212Whitney U test and a Bonferroni correction was applied to account for multiple comparisons. To determine if sample demographics were statistically significantly different, a one-way analysis of variance analysis (ANOVA) was conducted using the IBM SPSS Statistics toolbox (v. 24.0).",
