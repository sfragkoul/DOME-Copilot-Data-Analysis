  "dataset/provenance": "The Human Connectome Project's Young Adult dataset was used for functional MRI data. This dataset is widely used and well established in MRI analysis.",
  "dataset/splits": "We used internal cross-validation (k-fold validation) with a k of 128. We also used a large number of subjects varied between 999 and 1077 according to the respective analysis. Distribution of data types did thus not differ between train and test sets.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "Our dataset was split fold-wise into test and train sets randomly. Since the dataset contains some data from siblings, we took care not to split siblings into corresponding train/test pairs.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The ML algorithm used is a form of linear regression. Connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) was used as described in [1]. CPM uses simple correlation described by Pearson's r between features (edges of a connectome) and a to-be-predicted measure (in this case, BMI) in the train set. From negative and positive correlations between features and the measure a general linear model is constructed, which is then used to predict the test set's measure.\n\n[1] Shen X, Finn ES, Scheinost D, et al.

  "optimization/meta": "No data from other ML algorithms was used. ",
  "optimization/encoding": "A preprocessed version of the Human Connectome Project's (HCP) Young Adults dataset was used. While a comprehensive and detailed description has been published elsewhere [1], a concise description of the steps involved is as follows: In a first step, correction for distortions related to gradient nonlinearity (which is more pronounced in the HCP\u2019s scanner setup) was applied with a FreeSurfer software package. The FSL software\u2019s FLIRT method was then used to correct for head motion. Grand-mean intensity normalization was performed on the fMRI time series. One of the keystones of fMRI studies is reliable intersubject comparability, which requires translating a subject\u2019s physical space into a common standard space (\u201dregistering\u201d). The HCP addressed this fundamental issue via multimodal registering, i.e. using a variety of imaging modalities to reliably and automati- cally identify anatomical or functional landmarks in each subject\u2019s 3D data and align them accordingly in what they call grayordi- nate space, a derivate of Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, in which only matter of interest (i.e. gray matter) is preserved. Building on work described in [2], Glasser et al. [3] developed a multi-modal and mapped areal-feature-based (dubbed \u201dMSMAll\u201d) registration method, which uses myelin maps, resting-state brain networks, visuotopic maps, and a subcortical region of interest for inter-subject alignment (see the supplemental methods of [3] for implementation details).  The analysis is a parcellated analysis. For the cerebral cortex, HCP-MMP1.0 (Human Connectome Project Multi- Modal Parcellation version 1.0, [3]) by Glasser et al. was used. They delineated 180 parcels per hemisphere (360 in total) by using the overlap of four areal feature maps, one for each modality (cortical thickness, relative myelin content, tfMRI, rsfMRI). Subcortical parcels were provided by Tian et al. [4]. They relied on subcortical-to-cortical connectivity derived from the HCP\u2019s rsfMRI data to delineate 27 subcortical parcels per hemisphere (54 in total) along connectivity gradients, i.e. sufficiently stark changes in func tional connectivity. Finally, cerebellar parcels came from a HCP-based study which clustered neighboring cerebellar voxels into 100 parcels by means of similarity of their rsfMRI time-series [5].

  "optimization/parameters": "Does not readily apply.",
  "optimization/features": "Features in CPM correspond to the edges of the connectome used to predict the measure in question. Since we used a 513 x 513 connectivity matrix (of which 99 x 513 nodes contained values of interest and were used as features), the number of features was comparatively high. They were selected with p < 0.05 as a thresholding mechanism and only selected in the training set. Feature selection and prediction was strictly separated.",
