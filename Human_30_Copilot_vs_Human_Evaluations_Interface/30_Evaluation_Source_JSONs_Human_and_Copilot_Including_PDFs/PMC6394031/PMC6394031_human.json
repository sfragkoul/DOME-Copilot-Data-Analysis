  "dataset/provenance": "This study used data from the KOBIO registry, which is a nationwide multicenter cohort in Korea that was established to evaluate the effectiveness and side effects of biologic therapies in patients with RA [13]. Patients in the registry were recruited from 38 hospitals since 2012, and their demographics, medications, comorbidities, extra-articular manifestations, disease activities, radiographic findings, and laboratory findings performed within 4 weeks prior to the patient\u2019s visit were recorded with the date. The data from patients who were followed up annually were recorded on the KOBIO website (http://www.kobio.or.kr/kobio/), and these patients provided informed consent prior to registration. Ethical approval of the KOBIO-RA was obtained from the institutional review boards of all 38 participating institutions, including the Institutional Review Board of Inje University Seoul Paik Hospital (PAIK 2018-11-005).",

  "optimization/encoding": "Dimension reduction was performed to avoid the \u201ccurse of dimensionality\u201d caused by a large number of variables compared with the size of the data. ",
  "optimization/features": "Among the 64 variables, we selected variables that are frequently encountered in clinical practice for prescription of biologics and excluded variables that are not referenced when prescribing biologics. As a result, 15 variables known to be of clinical importance were preselected (i.e., sex, age, baseline DAS28-ESR, methotrexate dose, steroid dose, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive protein [CRP], rheumatoid factor [RF], anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody [ACPA], anti-nuclear antibody [Anot reported], and five comorbidities). Subsequently, 20 variables that were highly correlated with the drug response (remission) of each bDMARD were selected. After selecting variables based on data, we created a prediction model by training with a fixed set of 35 variables. Missing data for variables (Additional file: Table S3) were replaced with the median value for each variable. With a similar logic, binary variables such as comorbidities were coded as 1 if \u201cyes\u201d and 0 if \u201cno\u201d or \u201cno test\u201d because \u201cno\u201d was the most common value.",
  "optimization/fitting": "To avoid overfitting problems, the training and test sets were divided in a 7:3 ratio, and the models were trained with the training set; then, the prediction results were verified using the test set. For the training dataset, a 5-fold cross validation was performed to tune the hyperparameters determined as outside models (Additional file: Table S1 and Table S2). In this procedure, a grid search was conducted to evaluate all possible combinations of the hyperparameters. The grid search found optimal hyperparameters with the objective function of determining the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) in each model. Bootstrapping (random sampling with replacement) was also performed to obtain a median value for the AUROC curve and to determine the accuracy for reducing measurement variances caused by small samples when dividing between the training and test sets.",
