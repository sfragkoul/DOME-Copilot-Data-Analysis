  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset utilized in this study comprises a cohort of 57 patients, each providing both tissue DNA (tDNA) and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) methylation sequencing data. This dataset is integral to our analysis and has been meticulously curated to ensure the robustness of our findings.\n\nThe data points within this cohort are diverse, encompassing a range of clinical and molecular characteristics that are crucial for our research. The inclusion of both tDNA and cfDNA allows for a comprehensive examination of methylation patterns, providing a more holistic understanding of the underlying biological processes.\n\nOur dataset has been previously used in other studies, contributing to the broader scientific community's knowledge base. The integration of multi-analytic models has been particularly noteworthy, as it has enhanced the predictive accuracy of our results. For instance, the performance of these models has been validated across different ranges of nodule lengths, demonstrating their reliability and applicability in various clinical scenarios.\n\nAdditionally, the dataset includes detailed information on the average extracted cfDNA quantity from malignant samples, which has been normalized to ng/mL of whole blood. This normalization process ensures consistency and comparability across different samples, further strengthening the validity of our conclusions.\n\nIn summary, the dataset is a valuable resource that has been leveraged in multiple studies, including our own, to advance the understanding of methylation sequencing and its implications in clinical research. The inclusion of both tDNA and cfDNA, along with the rigorous validation of our models, underscores the significance of this dataset in the scientific community.",
  "dataset/splits": "In our study, we utilized two primary data splits: a discovery cohort and an independent validation cohort. The discovery cohort consisted of 60% of the samples, which were randomly selected for training the models. The remaining 40% of the samples were used for testing and refining the models within the discovery cohort. This split was determined through a 13-fold cross-validation process to ensure robust model training and evaluation.\n\nThe independent validation cohort was used to assess the generalizability and performance of the models. The size of this cohort was determined through a power analysis using the OneROC Curve Power Analysis module of PASS2020 software, based on the model of Obuchowski and McClish. This analysis helped ensure that the validation cohort was sufficiently large to provide reliable results.\n\nAdditionally, we conducted a statistical analysis to determine the discovery cohort size, which was influenced by sample availability and the overall project timeline. Patient enrollment for the discovery cohort was stopped based on the performance analysis of the predictive markers and models.\n\nIn summary, our study involved a discovery cohort and an independent validation cohort, with the discovery cohort split into training and testing subsets through a 13-fold cross-validation process. The independent validation cohort was sized using a power analysis to ensure reliable model evaluation.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "Not enough information is available.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data supporting the findings of this study are available in the supplementary material of this article. Raw sequencing data are openly available at https://bigd.big.ac.cn/bioproject/browse/PRJCA003983. Additionally, the data can be obtained directly from the authors upon request. This ensures that the data is accessible to the scientific community for verification and further research.

The data is provided under the terms that allow for its use in research, subject to appropriate citation and acknowledgment of the original source. This approach ensures that the data is used responsibly and ethically, maintaining the integrity of the research.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in this study is Support Vector Machine (SVM). SVM is a well-established and widely used supervised learning algorithm for classification tasks. It works by finding the optimal hyperplane that best separates the data into different classes, in this case, benign and malignant samples. The algorithm optimizes the parameters for a predefined type of hyperplane, known as the kernel, to maximize the margin between the classes.\n\nA straightforward linear kernel was employed in the study. The hyper-parameter optimization was tuned using a cross-validation grid exhaustive search. This process involved randomly selecting 60% of the samples from the discovery cohort for training and the remaining 40% for testing. The training cohort was then fitted with the best score parameters obtained from the cross-validation process.\n\nThe SVM algorithm used is not new; it is a well-known and extensively studied method in the field of machine learning. The reason it was not published in a machine-learning journal is that the focus of this study is on its application in the medical field, specifically for lung cancer diagnosis. The study aims to advance the state-of-the-art by integrating various multi-omics platforms to improve the diagnostic efficacy of lung pulmonary nodules. The algorithm's implementation and optimization were tailored to this specific medical application, rather than being a novel contribution to the field of machine learning.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employs an integrative multianalytical approach, which serves as a meta-predictor. This meta-predictor utilizes the predictive outputs from four individual models as its input. These individual models focus on different study fields: clinical features, cancer protein markers, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) mutations, and cfDNA methylation. Each of these models generates a probability score indicating the likelihood of malignancy.\n\nThe meta-predictor is implemented using a Bayesian Network-Based (BNB) algorithm. This probabilistic algorithm, grounded in probability theory and Bayes' Theorem, is designed to predict the probability of an unknown input belonging to predefined classes. In this context, the BNB model optimizes the assignment of \"voting power\" (importance weight) to each individual model. This optimization process ensures that the final prediction is a weighted average of the individual models' scores, enhancing the overall accuracy and reliability of the classification.\n\nThe training process involves a 13-fold cross-validation, where hyper-parameter optimization is tuned using a cross-validation grid exhaustive search. This method ensures that the training data is independent for each fold, with 60% of the samples randomly selected for training and the remaining 40% for testing. The best score parameters from the training cohort are then used to fit the model.\n\nThe integrative multianalytical model demonstrates steady performance across different cohorts. For instance, it maintains an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.86 on the validation cohort, compared to 0.85 on the discovery cohort. This consistency indicates that the model effectively balances sensitivity and specificity, outperforming any individual testing platform. The model's ability to achieve a more comprehensive assembly of individual model outputs into correct predictions further validates its robustness and reliability.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the machine-learning algorithm, data encoding and preprocessing were crucial steps to ensure optimal model performance. Each numeric data point was first normalized using the log2(x + 1) transformation. This step helped control for outliers and approximate a Gaussian distribution, which is beneficial for many machine-learning algorithms.\n\nMissing data points were handled by imputing them with the median value of the corresponding feature readings from the discovery cohort. This approach ensures that the imputed values are representative of the data distribution and do not introduce bias.\n\nData standardization was performed using the z-score, calculated as z = (x \u2013 mean(X))/std(X), where X represents all readings of x in the discovery cohort. This standardization process scales the data to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, which is essential for algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of the input features.\n\nFor methylation MCB features, Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) was employed to conduct additional feature selection. This process recursively removes lower-ranked features from the candidate feature set and evaluates the performance of the remaining features through cross-validation. The goal is to achieve an optimized performance by selecting the most relevant features. Through 20 stratified shuffled-split cross-validators with 10 splitting iterations and a range of 20\u201340% test size, 30 MCBs out of the initially screened 43 candidates were selected as the consensus feature set for subsequent training. This rigorous feature selection process ensures that the model is trained on the most informative features, enhancing its predictive accuracy.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the number of parameters used in the model varied depending on the specific analytical approach. For the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, the parameters were optimized using a 13-fold cross-validation process. This involved tuning hyper-parameters through an exhaustive search within a cross-validation grid. The straightforward linear kernel used in the study required the optimization of parameters to maximize the separation between benign and malignant classes.\n\nFor the integrative multi-analytical model, each individual model's predictive output consisted of a probability score for malignancy. These scores, derived from clinical features, cancer protein markers, cfDNA mutations, and cfDNA methylation, were then used as inputs for a subsequent Bayesian Network-Based (BNB) model. The BNB model was trained to optimize the assignment of \"voting power\" to each individual model, effectively determining the importance weight of each model's prediction.\n\nThe selection of parameters was guided by the performance analysis of the predictive markers and models, cofactoring the overall project timeline. The discovery cohort size was largely affected by sample availability, and patient enrollment was stopped based on the performance of the predictive models. For the independent validation cohort, a power analysis was conducted using the OneROC Curve Power Analysis module of PASS2020 software, based on the model of Obuchowski and McClish. This ensured that the validation cohort size was adequate to achieve the desired statistical power.",
  "optimization/features": "In the optimization process, multiple types of input features were utilized, including clinical features, cancer protein biomarkers, cfDNA mutations, and cfDNA methylation markers. For the cfDNA methylation features, a recursive feature elimination process with cross-validation (RFECV) was employed to select the most relevant features. This process was conducted using the discovery cohort, ensuring that feature selection was performed using the training set only. Through this method, 30 methylation-correlated blocks (MCBs) were selected as the consensus feature set for subsequent training. Additionally, univariate analysis was performed on clinical features, cancer protein biomarkers, and cfDNA methylation MCBs to assess each variable's differentiating power between benign and malignant sample groups. Variables that showed statistical significance in at least four of the six univariate tests were considered candidate markers. The final integrative model combined the predictive outputs of these individual models, each contributing a probability score of being malignant. This approach ensured that the input features were optimized for the best performance in classifying pulmonary nodule malignancy.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The study employed a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel for classification, which inherently has a limited number of parameters relative to the size of the training dataset. This approach helps to mitigate the risk of overfitting, as the model complexity is constrained by the choice of a linear kernel.\n\nTo further ensure robustness, a 13-fold cross-validation strategy was implemented. This method involves dividing the dataset into 13 subsets, training the model on 12 of these subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated 13 times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. This technique helps to provide a more accurate estimate of the model's performance and reduces the likelihood of overfitting by ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data.\n\nAdditionally, hyper-parameter optimization was performed using an exhaustive grid search within each fold of the cross-validation. This process involved tuning the hyper-parameters to find the best combination that maximizes the model's performance on the validation set. By doing so, the model's ability to generalize to new data is enhanced, further reducing the risk of overfitting.\n\nThe dataset was split into training and testing sets, with 60% of the samples used for training and the remaining 40% for testing. This split ensures that the model is evaluated on data it has not seen during training, providing a realistic assessment of its performance.\n\nTo address the potential issue of underfitting, the study utilized an integrative multianalytical model that combines the predictive outputs of multiple individual models. Each model contributes a probability score indicating the likelihood of malignancy, and these scores are integrated using a Bayesian Network-Based (BNB) model. This approach leverages the strengths of multiple models, reducing the risk of underfitting by ensuring that the final prediction is based on a comprehensive analysis of various data types.\n\nIn summary, the use of cross-validation, hyper-parameter optimization, and an integrative multianalytical model helps to balance the trade-off between overfitting and underfitting, ensuring that the model is both robust and generalizable.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our models. One key method used was Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV). This technique helps in selecting the most relevant features by recursively removing the least important ones and evaluating the model's performance through cross-validation. This process was repeated until an optimal set of features was identified, which improved the model's accuracy and generalization capability.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized a 13-fold cross-validation approach for our Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. This method involves dividing the data into 13 subsets, training the model on 12 of these subsets, and validating it on the remaining one. This process is repeated 13 times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. This technique helps in ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data and reduces the risk of overfitting.\n\nFurthermore, we implemented hyper-parameter optimization using a cross-validation grid exhaustive search. This involved tuning the hyper-parameters of the SVM model to find the best combination that maximizes the model's performance on the training data. By doing so, we aimed to enhance the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.\n\nAnother important step in our process was the normalization and standardization of the data. Each numeric data point was first normalized using the log2(x + 1) transformation to control for outliers and approximate a Gaussian distribution. Missing data points were imputed with the median value of the corresponding feature readings on the discovery cohort. Finally, the data were standardized using z-score normalization, which helps in ensuring that all features contribute equally to the model's performance.\n\nThese techniques collectively helped in mitigating the risk of overfitting and ensured that our models were robust and generalizable to new data.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization schedule used in our study are detailed within the publication. Specifically, we employed a 13-fold cross-validation approach for our Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, utilizing a linear kernel. The hyper-parameter optimization was conducted through an exhaustive search within a cross-validation grid, with 60% of the samples from the discovery cohort used for training and the remaining 40% for testing. The best-performing parameters were then selected based on their scores.\n\nThe integrative multi-analytical model, which combines the predictive outputs of individual models focusing on clinical features, cancer protein markers, cfDNA mutations, and cfDNA methylation, was implemented using a Bayesian Network-Based (BNB) approach. This model assigns a probability score to each study field, optimizing the \"voting power\" of each individual model to fit the known classification labels of the data points.\n\nRegarding the availability of model files and optimization parameters, the data supporting our findings, including raw sequencing data, are accessible in the supplementary material of this article. Additionally, raw sequencing data can be found at https://bigd.big.ac.cn/bioproject/browse/PRJCA003983 or by contacting the authors. The specific details of the models and their configurations are also provided in the supporting information available from the Wiley Online Library or directly from the authors.\n\nThe study was conducted with support from various funding sources, including the Clinical Research Foundation of Army Medical University and the National Natural Science Foundation of China. The algorithms and models were implemented using an in-house Python toolkit, ensuring reproducibility and accessibility for further research.",
  "model/interpretability": "The integrative multianalytical model employed in this study is not a blackbox model. It leverages an ensemble approach that combines the predictive outputs of multiple individual models, each focusing on different study fields such as clinical features, cancer protein markers, cfDNA mutations, and cfDNA methylation. These individual models generate probability scores indicating the likelihood of malignancy, which are then used as inputs for a subsequent Bayesian Network-Based (BNB) model.\n\nThe BNB model is designed to optimize the assignment of \"voting power\" or importance weight to each individual model. This process ensures that the final prediction is a weighted average of the individual model outputs, taking into account their known performance on the training dataset. In essence, the BNB model derives a formula to calculate the probability of an input sample being malignant based on the combined predictions of all four classifiers.\n\nThis approach provides transparency by clearly delineating how each individual model contributes to the final prediction. The importance weight assigned to each model reflects its reliability and performance, making the decision-making process interpretable. For instance, if a particular model consistently performs well in predicting malignancy, it will be assigned a higher weight, thereby influencing the final prediction more significantly.\n\nMoreover, the model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as the Area Under the Curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity, which are well-understood and widely accepted in the scientific community. The integrative model's ability to achieve a satisfactory balance of sensitivity and specificity, as well as its superior performance compared to individual models, further underscores its transparency and reliability.",
  "model/output": "The model discussed in this publication is a classification model. It is designed to predict whether a sample is benign or malignant, which is a classic binary classification problem. The integrative multianalytical model combines the predictive outputs of four individual models, each focusing on different study fields such as clinical features, cancer protein markers, cfDNA mutations, and cfDNA methylation. These individual models generate probability scores indicating the likelihood of malignancy. The integrative model then uses these scores to assign importance weights to each individual model, ultimately providing a final classification.\n\nThe performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity. For instance, the model achieved an AUC of 0.86 on the validation cohort, with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 85.7% using a prediction score cut-off of 0.761. This demonstrates the model's ability to balance sensitivity and specificity effectively, outperforming any individual testing platform.\n\nThe integrative model's predictions are compared against gold-standard pathology assessments, showing that it can achieve more accurate predictions, especially in cases where individual models provide conflicting results. This highlights the model's strength in integrating diverse data sources to improve diagnostic accuracy.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "The algorithm was implemented in an in-house Python toolkit. However, the availability of this toolkit for public use is not specified. Therefore, it is not clear whether the source code or any method to run the algorithm, such as an executable, web server, virtual machine, or container instance, has been released.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the method involved several steps and datasets to ensure robustness and generalizability. Initially, a discovery cohort was used to identify statistical markers from various testing platforms and to establish multivariate and multianalytical models. These models were then benchmarked on an independent validation cohort consisting of 29 patients, with 14 benign and 15 malignant cases. The performance of the models was assessed using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric.\n\nFor the integrative model, which combines clinical features, cancer protein biomarkers, cfDNA mutations, and cfDNA methylation, an AUC of 0.85 was achieved on the discovery cohort. A power analysis was conducted to determine the minimal number of samples needed for adequate statistical power, which indicated a requirement of at least 11 benign and 11 malignant samples.\n\nUnivariate clinical features, such as patient age, maintained their predictive power on the validation cohort, with an AUC of 0.73. This translated to a sensitivity of 73.3% and a specificity of 64.3% using an optimized age cut-off of 54 years.\n\nThe protein cancer biomarker platform, which included markers like CEA, CYFRA 21-1, and SCC, showed some degradation in predictive power on the validation cohort. However, the combined multivariate prediction model demonstrated more steady performance, with an AUC dropping from 0.71 on the discovery cohort to 0.67 on the validation cohort. This model achieved a sensitivity of 60% and a specificity of 71.4% using an optimized Support Vector Machine (SVM) prediction score cut-off of 0.670.\n\nThe cfDNA mutation model, which had a low AUC of 0.54 on the discovery cohort, maintained the same level of performance on the validation cohort with an AUC of 0.62. This model struggled to balance prediction sensitivity and specificity, yielding a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 42.9% using an optimized cut-off threshold of 0.660.\n\nThe cfDNA methylation model showed performance degradation on the validation cohort, with an AUC dropping from 0.81 to 0.72. Despite this, it still achieved a sensitivity of 93.3% and a specificity of 42.9% using an optimized prediction score cut-off of 0.606, which is considered satisfactory in a clinical setting.\n\nTo further validate the cfDNA-based methylation cancer biomarkers (MCBs), independent tissue DNA (tDNA) methylation sequencing was conducted on 57 patients across both discovery and validation cohorts. This cross-validation step showed that tDNA profiles had a higher difference across benign and malignant groups than cfDNA, indicating that the MCBs were picking up malignant tumor-specific features. Additionally, cfDNA profiles showed a high Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.84 with tDNA profiles, supporting that cfDNA-based MCB measurements were primarily derived from their paired tissue samples.\n\nOverall, the integrative multianalytical model demonstrated steady performance with an AUC of 0.86 on the validation cohort, corresponding to a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 85.7% using a prediction score cut-off of 0.761. This model significantly outperformed any individual testing platform, striking a satisfactory balance of sensitivity and specificity.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our evaluation, we reported several key performance metrics to assess the effectiveness of our models. For individual models, we presented the Area Under the Curve (AUC) values, which indicate the ability of the models to distinguish between benign and malignant lung nodules. Specifically, we reported AUCs for models based on protein biomarkers, cfDNA mutations, and cfDNA methylation profiles, both on the discovery and validation cohorts.\n\nAdditionally, we provided sensitivity and specificity values for each model, which measure the true positive rate and true negative rate, respectively. These metrics are crucial for understanding the models' performance in clinical settings, where balancing false positives and false negatives is essential.\n\nFor the integrative multianalytical model, which combines multiple analytical approaches, we reported an AUC of 0.86 on the validation cohort, demonstrating its superior performance compared to individual models. This model also achieved a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 85.7%, indicating a strong balance between detecting true positives and minimizing false positives.\n\nWe also discussed the performance of the models in relation to nodule size, noting that the quantity of circulating tumor DNA in blood is positively correlated with the stage of the cancer. This correlation helps to contextualize the performance metrics within the clinical relevance of nodule size.\n\nFurthermore, we compared the integrative model's predictions against the gold-standard pathology assessment, showing that it outperformed individual models, especially in cases where individual models made conflicting predictions. This comparison highlights the robustness and reliability of the integrative approach.\n\nIn summary, our reported performance metrics include AUC, sensitivity, and specificity for both individual and integrative models. These metrics are representative of the standards used in the literature for evaluating diagnostic models in medical research. The integrative model's performance, in particular, demonstrates a significant improvement over individual models, providing a comprehensive and reliable tool for detecting malignant lung nodules.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we conducted a thorough comparison of our integrative multianalytical model with various individual testing platforms and publicly available methods. This comparison was crucial to demonstrate the superiority and robustness of our approach.\n\nWe evaluated the performance of our model against individual protein biomarkers, cfDNA mutation models, and cfDNA methylation models. Each of these individual models showed varying levels of performance, with AUC scores dropping significantly when transitioning from the discovery cohort to the validation cohort. For instance, the AUC for individual protein biomarkers decreased from 0.72, 0.68, and 0.67 on the discovery cohort to 0.54, 0.52, and 0.66 on the validation cohort, respectively. In contrast, our combined multivariate prediction model maintained a more steady performance, with an AUC of 0.71 on the discovery cohort and 0.67 on the validation cohort. This consistency highlights the strength of our integrative approach in balancing sensitivity and specificity.\n\nAdditionally, we compared our model with PET/CT, a widely used diagnostic tool. Our integrative model significantly outperformed PET/CT, achieving an AUC of 0.94 in diagnosing between tuberculoma and malignant lung nodules, a task that was particularly challenging for PET/CT with an AUC of 0.65. This comparison underscores the effectiveness of our model in providing a more accurate and reliable diagnosis.\n\nFurthermore, we validated our cfDNA-based MCB features using independent tissue DNA (tDNA) methylation sequencing. This cross-validation showed that tDNA profiles exhibited a higher difference across benign and malignant groups than cfDNA, indicating that our MCBs were effectively capturing tumor-specific features. The high Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.84 between cfDNA and tDNA profiles further supports the reliability of our cfDNA-based measurements.\n\nIn summary, our study demonstrates that the integrative multianalytical model outperforms individual testing platforms and publicly available methods, providing a more comprehensive and accurate diagnostic tool for malignant lung nodules. This comparison not only validates the effectiveness of our approach but also highlights its potential for real-world clinical utility.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the models presented in this study includes several performance metrics, such as the Area Under the Curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity. These metrics were calculated for both the discovery and validation cohorts, providing a comprehensive assessment of the models' predictive capabilities.\n\nThe AUC values, which measure the ability of the models to distinguish between benign and malignant cases, were reported with a certain degree of variability between the discovery and validation cohorts. For instance, the AUC for the combined multivariate prediction model decreased from 0.71 on the discovery cohort to 0.67 on the validation cohort. This fluctuation indicates the need for further validation and potentially larger sample sizes to ensure robustness.\n\nStatistical significance was assessed using various methods, including the Wilcoxon test for comparing methylation profiles between benign and malignant groups. The high Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.84 between cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and tissue DNA (tDNA) profiles further supports the reliability of the cfDNA-based measurements.\n\nPower analysis was conducted to determine the size of the independent validation cohort using the OneROCCurvePowerAnalysis module of PASS2020 software, based on the model of Obuchowski and McClish. This analysis helps ensure that the validation cohort is sufficiently powered to detect meaningful differences in performance.\n\nThe integrative multianalytical model demonstrated steady performance with an AUC of 0.86 on the validation cohort, compared to 0.85 on the discovery cohort. This model achieved a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 85.7%, striking a satisfactory balance between these two metrics. The model's performance was significantly better than that of any individual testing platform, indicating its superior predictive capability.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics presented in this study are supported by statistical analyses that confirm their significance. The integrative multianalytical model, in particular, shows robust and reliable performance, making it a strong candidate for clinical application. However, further validation with larger and more diverse cohorts is recommended to reinforce these findings.",
  "evaluation/availability": "The raw evaluation files are not publicly available. The study includes detailed tables and figures in the supporting information, such as Table S8, which lists patient IDs for a cohort with both tissue DNA and cell-free DNA methylation sequencing. Additionally, Table S9 provides data on the average extracted cell-free DNA quantity and the model's performance across different nodule lengths. Table S10 presents PET/CT results for an independent cohort, and Table S11 shows the prediction results of the integrative multi-analytical model for a subset of patients. These tables and figures offer comprehensive insights into the evaluation process and outcomes. However, the specific raw data files used for these evaluations are not released to the public."
