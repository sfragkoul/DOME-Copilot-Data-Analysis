DOME-ML (Data, Optimisation, Model, and Evaluation in Machine Learning) annotation, supporting the current study, is available through DOME Wizard.
"	The source of the data is from a database we compiled, the Visual Physiology Opsin Database (VPOD) (10.5281/zenodo.10667840 or https://github.com/VisualPhysiologyDB/visual-physiology-opsin-db/). VPOD_1.0 is a new database, available on GitHub, that currently includes all heterologously expressed animal opsins. We refer to a subset of the database with only heterologous data as VPOD_het_1.0, although for version 1.0, this is synonymous with the entire database. VPOD_het_1.0 relies on 68 publications, mainly primary sources, with dates ranging from the 1980’s to 2023. The database contains opsin sequences and phenotype data from 166 unique species (counting 35 reconstructed ancestors), including fishes, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, crustaceans, and bivalves. Altogether, VPOD_het_1.0 contains 864 unique opsin sequences and corresponding λmax values.	"We used naming conventions that include versioning to improve reproducibility and reliability of individual datasets and models. For example, one subset combines ultraviolet and SWS opsins, which we named VPOD_uss_het_1.0 (n=280). Our convention is to name the subset (in this case USS = ‘Ultraviolet and Short-wave Sensitive’ opsins); name the source of phenotype data (heterologous = het), and record the version number of the dataset (1.0). We also created subsets for medium- and long-wave sensitive opsins (VPOD_mls_het_1.0)(n=91) and all rod (Rh1) and rod-like (Rh2) opsins (VPOD_rod_het_1.0)(n=352). Other subsets use species taxonomy, one for vertebrates (VPOD_vert_het_1.0)(n=721) and another for invertebrates (VPOD_inv_het_1.0)(n=143). For taxonomic subsets, we considered all sequences from phylum Chordata as ‘vertebrates’ and the rest as 'invertebrates’. Another subset excludes all mutant opsin sequences, called ‘wild-types’ (VPOD_wt_het_1.0)(n=318). A final named subset is the whole data set (VPOD_wds_het_1.0)(n=864).

"	For model training, a whole dataset it submitted to the algorithm training pipeline and it is randomly sampled to split the data such  that 80% is used for training, and 20% is used for model validation. The amount of data points in these splits/sets are dependent on the subset of data used to train the models. As mentioned earlier, VPOD_het_1.0 contains 864 unique opsin sequences and corresponding λmax values. From this we created eleven data subsets with varying levels of taxonomic and gene family inclusivity to test which factors most impact the reliability/performance of ML methods.	4.0	0.0	Yes, this all available on our GitHub repository, (10.5281/zenodo.10667840 or https://github.com/VisualPhysiologyDB/visual-physiology-opsin-db/).	We didn't compare to an existing publicly available ML methods. However, we compared performance of ML models to phylogenetic imputation, which estimates phenotypes using phylogenetic information. Phylogenetic imputation uses maximum likelihood (we will not abbreviate maximum likelihood as ML to avoid confusion with machine learning), assuming Brownian Motion to predict missing phenotypes using a phylogenetic tree, assuming more closely related species or sequences have more similar phenotypes. We randomly removed 50 opsin sequences, and their corresponding λmax values from each of the training datasets used to train our ML models (with the exception of the smaller MWS/LWS and invertebrate datasets, in which we only removed 15), then estimated the removed λmax values using phylogenetic imputation. We used the phylogenetic imputation sub-module of the phytools R package for performing imputation. We compared imputed and actual λmax using regression. 	No	The default performance metrics for regression and classification that deepBreaks uses are Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and F-score. The default list of metrics that deepBreaks reports are provided in the documentation provide predefined custom metrics or a set of metrics from the scikit-learn library in python.	"For model evaluation and comparison, deepBreaks by default uses a 10-fold cross-validation approach and ranks
the models based on their average cross-validation score.
As we described in the methods of the main text ""we created eleven data subsets with varying levels of taxonomic and gene family inclusivity (Table 1) to test which factors most impact the reliability/performance of ML methods. We used naming conventions that include versioning to improve reproducibility and reliability of individual datasets and models. For example, one subset combines ultraviolet and SWS opsins, which we named VPOD_uss_het_1.0. Our convention is to name the subset (in this case USS = ‘Ultraviolet and Short-wave Sensitive’ opsins); name the source of phenotype data (heterologous = het), and record the version number of the dataset (1.0). We also created subsets for medium- and long-wave sensitive opsins (VPOD_mls_het_1.0) and all rod (Rh1) and rod-like (Rh2) opsins (VPOD_rod_het_1.0). Other subsets use species taxonomy, one for vertebrates (VPOD_vert_het_1.0) and another for invertebrates (VPOD_inv_het_1.0). For taxonomic subsets, we considered all sequences from phylum Chordata as ‘vertebrates’ and the rest as 'invertebrates’. Another subset excludes all mutant opsin sequences, called ‘wild-types’ (VPOD_wt_het_1.0). A final named subset is the whole data set (VPOD_wds_het_1.0). 
Using various subsets of data, we performed a number of experiments to better understand the performance of ML models in predicting λmax. First, to better understand how training data relate to model performance, R2 , and training data size, we gradually increased the size of training datasets, using the WDS, Vertebrate, WT, and Rod subsets separately, by adding between 15-50 randomly selected sequences at a time, repeating the process three times per data split (Table S1). We then analyzed the fit between the size of training data sets (x-axis) and model performance (y-axis), comparing six non-linear models with AIC to find the model that best explains the observed variation (Figure S2). Second, to understand if ML could predict known phenotypic changes due to experimental mutations, we queried the top performing WT model (which lacks data from artificially mutated sequences) using all experimentally mutated opsins to predict their phenotypes. We plotted these results using matplotlib [49] to visualize characteristics of poorly predicted outliers (e.g., taxonomic bias or sensitivity to mutations which caused large shifts in λmax from the WT). Third, we examined the ability of our models to predict λmax of thirty invertebrate opsins not in VPOD_1.0 because they are only known from physiological studies (Table S3, Figure S4). Here, we collected data both characterized by single-cell microspectrophotometry (MSP) or electroretinogram methods and with expression localized to cell-type by in-situ-hybridization (ISH), to link λmax to a specific opsin (the sequences and metadata can be found in ‘msp_erg_raw.txt’ and ‘msp_erg_meta.tsv’, while the resulting predictions can be found under the ‘msp_tests’ folder on our GitHub repository). Finally, we directly compared predictive capabilities of models trained on different data subsets by randomly selecting and removing the same 25 wild-type ultraviolet or short-wave sensitive opsins from the training data of the WDS, Vertebrate, WT, and UVS/SWS models before training and querying the model with those same sequences following training (Table S3, Figure S5).

All data and code (software) is covered under a GNU General Public License (Version 3), in accordance with Open Source Initiative (OSI)-policies. 	A single representative prediction, all the way to several hundred predictions, takes only a matter of seconds to complete on a normal desktop PC.  Additionally, training the models can completed in a matter of minutes on a desktop PC as well.  	"All models used are generally interpretable, primarily due to the nature of the feature selection process, treating each position on an amino acid sequence as a feature. 
For interpreting the contribution of sequence positions to the predictive models, we use the feature importance, coefficients, and weights as different algorithms have different kinds of
output. For xgboost and lightgbm the reported feature importance represents the number of times a feature appears in a tree. For AdaBoost, random forest, decision tree, extra tree, and
gradient boosting the importance of a feature is its Gini importance which is computed as the
normalized total reduction of the criterion brought by that feature."	The models used for our paper were all regression, but deepBreaks provides the option to also train classification models in an identical manner. 	4.0	0.0	We then trained various ML models employing a custom version of deepBreaks, an ML tool designed for exploring genotype-phenotype associations. For continuous phenotypes, deepBreaks fit models using twelve different existing ML linear regression algorithms including, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Bayesian Regression, Lasso Least Angle Regression, Huber Regressor, Extremely Randomized Trees (Extra Trees), Extreme Gradient Boosting (xgboost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (lightgbm), Random Forest, Decision Tree, and AdaBoost. deepBreaks takes aligned genotype data (DNA, RNA, Amino Acid) and some measure(s) of corresponding continuous or categorical phenotype data as input to train ML models. 	Yes, they are likely available in the scikit-learn documentation. 	The deepBreaks pipeline for preprocessing starts with dropping columns in the dataset that contain missing values over a certain threshold. The default threshold is 80% of the number of samples.  Dropping the zero-entropy (constant) features from the dataset, is the next step.   deepBreaks uses one-hot encoding to convert amino acid sequences into numerical values. One consequence of this encoding is any amino acids at a given position in the alignment, which are not present at that position in any training data, will be treated equivalently as unseen. For example, cases of only A and V at a highly conserved site in the training set that are presented with a sequence with T at that site will be considered as no A and no V. The models cannot distinguish the input whether it's T or other unseen amino acids at that site.  	"The number of input features is variable depending on the length of the sequences following sequences alignment and the many preprocessing and feature selection steps. deepBreaks uses the Kruskal-Wallis tests (for continuous phenotypes)  to reduce the number of positions in the training data set and drop the redundant ones. This statistical test is used to assess the significance of each position by running tests on all the positions against the phenotype one by one. Those features where the p-value of their test against the phenotype is less than a threshold (default p-value = 0.25) will be dropped. A list of all features and their test p-values are provided a report to the user. Then, since deepBreaks considers each position in the sequences as a feature of our training dataset,  it checks for collinearity between our predictive variables, as it can cause issues for parameter estimation. To check for the relationship between
"	We did not focus on ruling out overfitting or underfitting, however these features may be present in the scikit-learn backend. 	No	For all of the above-mentioned models deepBreaks by default uses the default hyperparameters from the scikit-learn library in python and a grid search (expandable by user preference) parameter set that is provided in the documentation.	We did not directly impliment any regularization measures, however I know certain models like the Light Gradient Boosted Machine and Xtreme Gradient Boosted Machine algorithms have regularization terms/parameters to limit overfitting.  That said, more information on this can be found in the scikit-learn documentation or in the corresponding literature for each machine learning algorithm type. 	7.0	1.0	65d6a5c492c76639b881cd51	39460934.0	PMC11512451	02/02/2026 19:46:52	Frazer SA, Baghbanzadeh M, Rahnavard A, Crandall KA, Oakley TH.

After the collagen droplet had polymerized, we changed the medium and transferred the plates to an Incucyte Live-Cell Analysis System, which captured images of the spheroids every hour for a duration of 24 hours. Additionally, we employed a ZEISS Axio Vert.A1 Inverted Microscope to manually capture images of the spheroids at specific time points. By utilizing both methods, we were able to collect a diverse range of spheroid images, resulting in a robust dataset for our DL model.

You can check raw data in the folder-original_data, and preprocessed data by each step in the folder-Count_Preprocessing and folder-Preprocessing. (This part is described at Section 2 and Code Availability Statement)	"Dataset is originated from four different public datasets in Qiita. Each dataset is open to the public from references: 1. Lloyd-Price et al (published 2019, citation#=1233), 2. Flores et al. (published 2014, citation #=377), 3. Halfvarsona et al. (published 2017, citation #=825), 4. McDonald et al. (published 2018, citation #=476). A Total of 2140 samples are used for the experiment. (citation # is referred at 2022/12/22) (This part is described at Section 2.1)
Among 1569 samples which have class state, 702 samples are positive and the rest are negative. Number of positives and negatives is similar, and various performance indexes are calculated to avoid class imbalance problems. (This part is described at Section 2)"	Partitioning is done by splitting the training and the independent test (never used for preprocessing, feature selection, parameter tuning) and, internally to the training set, by bootstrapping to maintain the class balance and random sorting. (This part is described at Section 2)	The ratio between training and test set was 80:20. Separate validation set was not used. To maintain the distribution of data types, bootstrapping was used. 	4.0	0.0	The source code containing evaluation files is open to the public at https://gitlab.com/sysbiobig/mlonmicrobiome with GNU General Public License. 	To validate the performance improvement/consistence, we compare with public, simple algorithm which is Linear SVM based RFE without any special preprocessing method. 	To prove the low variability of performance, the standard deviation of performance is written together with average in Supplementary Tables. Variability is rounded to two decimal places. 	To validate the evaluation, we check various performance indexes (MCC, AUC, accuracy, PPV, NPV, sensitivity, specificity) and stability indexes (rank based stability measurement-number of common features, Pearson Correlation, Canberra Distance, Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity). Evaluation is done by test dataset obtained from following process: merging benchmark datasets and splitting into training dataset and test dataset by random sort(bootstrapping). 	As illustrated in Fig.1, we divided the entire dataset into Ensemble Dataset 1 and Ensemble Dataset 2. And each ensemble dataset was divided to training set and test set. With this pipeline, we are able to evaluate the entire pipeline in two independent separate dataset. 	5.0	0.0	The source code is open to the public at https://gitlab.com/sysbiobig/mlonmicrobiome with GNU General Public License. 	The major execution time was consumed by RFE stage, and we recorded the execution time in the source code. In each bootstrap, RFE with mapping by Bray-curtis similarity matrix required around 3~4 minutes. 	We reported interpretation of model in Figure 5 by SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). 	We used regressor to predict between healthy and IBD samples. 	4.0	0.0	Eight different types of prediction algorithms, namely logistic regression, linear SVM, random forest, XGBoost, Perceptron, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with 1, 2 or 3 hidden layers, were used to classify samples in IBD vs. healthy using the features selected within the RFE phase. There was no new ML algorithm. 	We reported how hyperparameters were tuned in 2.5 Classification Model Algorithms, and reported the code at https://gitlab.com/sysbiobig/mlonmicrobiome with GNU General Public License. 	As explained in Section 2.1 Data, we divided the abundance profiles by the geometric mean in each data source and took the log (base 2) of the ratios, and then min-max scaler was applied.	We selected a core set of features with 283 taxa at the species level and 220 at the genus level. Feature selection was done by RFE, which is a core part of our paper. RFE was done only by training dataset. 	In this experiment, f was large so that overfitting should be considered (f>100). In this aspect, we propose stable feature selection method to prevent overfitting. 	Before applying the eight different types of prediction algorithms, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) by Linear SVM was used. RFE stage was done solely by training dataset, and test dataset was used only for evaluating the performance of eight different prediction algorithms.	Grid search is used to tune major parameters (learning rate, regularization parameter). Grid search is done solely on the training dataset in cross validation. As all models are built from scikit-learn library 1.0.2, definitions of parameters are all released in the library page and also summarized in Methods. (This part is described at Section 2.2 and 2.5.1)	We applied RFE with mapping transformation to prevent overfitting.

We consistently maintained an independent test set for all datasets in order to evaluate the model's performance and determine if there was any overfitting or underfitting. Additionally, we employed cross-validation methods and feature selection techniques to mitigate the risk of overfitting. These measures helped ensure a more reliable assessment of the model's generalization capabilities and minimize the influence of biased or noisy data.	The ML pipeline employed in this project incorporates several preprocessing steps, including data resampling and feature selection. These steps are followed by model training and evaluation. To prevent any potential data leakage, we perform data preparation within cross validation folds. Additionally, we maintain an independent test dataset to ensure accurate and unbiased evaluation.	The majority of the trained models were utilized with their default parameters.	We employed cross-validation methods and feature selection techniques to mitigate the risk of overfitting. These measures helped ensure a more reliable assessment of the model's generalization capabilities and minimize the influence of biased or noisy data.	8.0	0.0	670e3b6e908d74f9cb331be6	38206587.0	PMC10783149	02/02/2026 19:46:52	Akshay A, Katoch M, Shekarchizadeh N, Abedi M, Sharma A, Burkhard FC, Adam RM, Monastyrskaya K, Gheinani AH.

The source of the dataset is INfrastructure for a PHAge REference Database (INPHARED) provided by https://github.com/RyanCook94/inphared on Aug 1st, 2022. There are 3,659 bacteriophage genomes in this dataset. We curated 1912 tailspike protein sequences and 200732 non-tailspike protein sequences from this dataset. This data has not been used in previous papers.	To train and validate the SpikeHunter the manually curated set of tailspike proteins was first clustered into 20,274 clusters at 30% identity using CD-HIT. The dataset was divided into training, validation, and testing datasets in a ratio of 3:1:1 using the StratifiedGroupKFold function in the Scikit-learn python package, with two key objectives in mind: 1) ensuring the absence of overlaps among protein clusters, and 2) maintaining consistent ratios of positive to negative samples across the splits. As a result of this process, the training, validation and test sets are independent.	The dataset was divided into training, validation, and testing datasets in a ratio of 3:1:1. The training set includes 122,506 proteins (comprising 1,023 positive samples and 121,483 negative samples belonging to 12,170 clusters), a validation set 40,838 proteins (comprising 343 positive samples and 40,495 negative samples belonging to 4,054 clusters), and a test set 39,300 proteins (comprising 546 positive samples and 38,754 negative samples belonging to 4,050 clusters).	4.0	0.0	Yes.

Phage protein sequences were tokenized and transformed into numerical vectors using the batch_converter function in the ESM Python package (https://github.com/facebookresearch/esm).	Since the sequences are embedded as 1280-length representations using a pre-trained transformer protein language model ESM-2 during training, the number of input features before embedding varies depending on the lengths of protein sequences, while the number of features after the embedding is 1280. No feature selection strategy was performed.	The model's parameter count is approximately eight times the number of training data points. Early stopping was adopted to stop training once the model performance was no longer improved on the validation dataset for three consecutive epochs to avoid overfitting.

When training the four MOB classification models suitable for different length ranges, the training and testing sets were randomly split in a 7:3 ratio. There was no overlap between the training and testing sets; they were independent of each other.	When training plasmid DNA word vectors based on the Skip-gram language model, MOBFinder utilized a total of 37,139 plasmid genomes. For training the four MOB classification models, this study obtained the complete plasmid genomes from the NCBI database again and annotated them with MOB typing using the relaxase database. Subsequently, 67,925 plasmid genomes determined by MOB typing were used to simulate plasmid assembly fragments from metagenomic datasets for training the MOB classification models	4.0	0.0	 The evaluation script for this tool will be uploaded to the relevant database after the article is published.

Classification.	4.0	0.0	The machine learning algorithms used in this study are the Skip-gram language model and Random Forest. Both of these methods are well-known in machine learning. Currently, methods used for MOB typing annotation rely on relaxase-based approaches such as MOB-suite and MOBscan. However, in metagenomic plasmid assembly fragments, relaxase sequences are often missing or incomplete. As a result, most plasmid assembly fragments are annotated as non-transferable plasmids. Due to differences in sequence features and host range among different MOB types, this study utilized the Skip-gram language model to digitally encode the biological patterns and features of metagenomic plasmid assembly fragments, resulting in significant performance improvements for MOBFinder. With a training dataset of up to 990,000 entries, Random Forest was used to prevent overfitting in training the MOB classification models. The combined use of these two algorithms effectively enhanced the performance of predicting MOB types in metagenomic plasmid assembly fragments. In some cases, F1 and AUC scores reached as high as 0.99, almost perfect.	According to our test results, MOBFinder takes approximately 5 to 18 minutes to predict on the test set, depending on the length and quantity of input data.	"1.

67333632a96b586fdb27231e	You can access to the curated RefSeq dataset with the link http://zenodo.org/records/14005015 (dataset.tar.gz), which is licensed under the CC0 license.	The data is all curated from the NCBI RefSeq database. There are 173,666, 99,945, 28,081 data points for the three GO categories, MF, BP, and CC, repectively (three sub-tasks). The minimum positive points of each label is set to 50. Because we formulate the plasmid protein function prediction as a multi-class, multi-label classification on 377 labels (172 MF labels + 174 BP labels + 31 CC labels), we can't show all the detailed number of positive/negative points for the 377 binary classifications here. However, you can check more detailed information from the Supplementary Figure S3 in the manuscript. Because we manually curated the dataset based on the RefSeq database, the protein sequences and their GO annotations are very reliable.	As described above, the generated test set can serve as a novel protein set compared to the training set. Specficially, the minimum normalized edit distances between the training set and the test set for most of the labels are larger than 0.7 (as shown in Supplementary Figure S4 in the manuscript).	There are three sub-tasks for our tool, namely the GO term classifications on the MF, BP, and CC categories, respectively. The detailed training/validation/test ratios for the three sub-tasks are 99,806/56,491/17,369, 60,143/29,768/10,034, and 21,228/4,045/2,808. You might find that the splitting ratio is not fixed, because we curated this dataset by simulating the novel protein function prediction scenario. Specifically, for each GO category, we allocated 10% of the most recently released proteins with GO annotations as the test set. Additionally, we ensure that the novel test set significantly differs from the training set in terms of protein sequences. Therefore, among the remaining 90% annotated proteins, those lacking significant alignments (E-value>1e-3) to the test set were assigned to the training set, while others were assigned to the validation set. This splitting strategy poses significant challenges for both PlasGO. Because of the large number of the binary classifications (377), we can't plot all the distributions. However, the data type distributions are roughly consistent for the training, validation, and test sets.	4.0	0.0	Yes, you can check the dataset used for benchmark experiments via the Zenodo repository [14005015] at http://zenodo.org/records /14005015.	Because the RefSeq test set we curated is to simulate the novel protein function prediction scenario, we didn't include any alignment-based tools for benchmarking, such as Diamond and BLASTP. Additionally, we conducted the benchmarking experiments with six learning-based state-of-the-art tools, including DeepGOPlus, PFresGO, TALE, DeepSeq, TM-Vec, and CaLM. For a fair comparison, we retrained all of them using our curated RefSeq dataset (training/validation/test). The results showed that PlasGO performed the best on all three GO categories (Figure 6 in the manuscript).	No. The two evaluation metrics do not relate to confidence intervals. For more details, please refer to the CAFA challanges.	"We used the two commonly used metrics in the CAFA challenge, namely the protein-centric Fmax and the term-centric AUPR. For more details of the two metrics, please refer to the ""Experimental setup"" section in the manuscript."	We conducted a series of rigorous experiments to evaluate the performance of PlasGO. All of them can be checked in the manuscript's Results part. Specifically, they include 1) the performance on the novel RefSeq test set, 2) two ablation studies for validating PlasGO’s design rationale, 3) visualization of the PlasGO embeddings for interpreting the BERT module, 4) identification of elusive GO term labels to improve the precision of PlasGO, 5) labels of different frequencies and confidence scores which show the performance stability on different labels and the effectiveness of the learned confidence scores, 6) application: automatic GO prediction for unannotated plasmid-encoded proteins in RefSeq, which pre-annotates high-confidence GO terms for all available plasmid proteins (678,197), 7) case study: annotations for two well-studied conjugative plasmids associated with AMR.	5.0	0.0	Yes. You can refer to the GitHub repository https://github.com/Orin-beep/PlasGO for most recent updates. Licensed under the MIT license.	The running speed of PlasGO is very fast. For the 365 plasmid proteins in the example data, it only took 1m48s for the GO term prediction on one NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. 	The model is interpretable. We mainly interpreted the global BERT module of PlasGO by comparing the raw embeddings generated from the ProtTrans model and the contextualized embeddings from the global BERT module. You can check the results from Figure 7 in the manuscript. The results showed thats suggests that PlasGO effectively captures the latent features associated with plasmid-specific functions.	Classification.	4.0	0.0	We employed deep learning in our tool. PlasGO consists of three sub-modules, a pre-trained protein language model, a global BERT model, and a classifier module incorporating a self-attention confidence weighting mechanism. The core part of PlasGO is the BERT model to learn the global context within plasmid sentences. We used the BERT model because we formuated plasmids as a language defined on the protein token set, and BERT is one of the state-of-the-art language models.	Yes, you can check PlasGO's default models (models.tar.gz) via the Zenodo repository [14005015] at http://zenodo.org/records/14005015, which is licensed under the CC0 license.	We employed the powerful foundation protein languange model, ProtTrans, to encode our input protein sequences. It can generate biologically meaningful embedding for each plasmid-encoded protein. Then, the raw input embeddings can greatly improve the performance of GO term prediction through transfer learning. 	"As described in V.3, the only input is the plasmid protein amino acid (AA) sequences. Then, ProtTrans is employed to generate the raw embeddings for each protein (preprocessing). By capturing the
semantic meaning of individual AA tokens and their contextual relationships within the protein sequence, ProtTrans will generate per-protein embeddings (1024 dimensions) as the input to the subsequent BERT module."	We have 89,835 plasmid sentences in total for training the simplified global BERT model with token classification task. As shown above, the simplest BERT model (CC) have hyperparameter of hidden_size=512, head_num=8, and layer_num=2. The corpus size (89,835) is sufficient to fit the BERT module. In addition, there are several overfitting strategies in the PlasGO models, which will be listed in V.7.	No. There is no data from other ML algorithms as input to PlasGO.	The parameter number is 13340504 for MF model, 13698908 for BP model, and 6891070 for CC model. Actually, the three models are all simple BERT models with hidden_size = 512, head_num = 8. Besides, we used 4 Transformer layers for MF and BP, and 2 Transformer layers for CC, considering the relatively smaller dataset size and label size for CC.	Yes. 1) Dropout layers adopted on both the classifier FC layer and also the attention blocks in the BERT model. 2) Validation set is employed to prevent overfitting. 3) Layer Normalization is employed for each Transformer block and also the token embedding layer. 4) A rank regularization method is utilized in the classifier module to promote the ability of the model to distinguish low-confidence and high-confidence predictions.

"scGraph2Vec is a deep-learning framework for generating gene embeddings that are highly informative by incorporating single-cell data patterns of neighbor genes and communities. The datasets used for training are the gene-by-cell matrix from public available scRNA-seq data and the interaction network from the BioGRID database (release v.4.4.210, https://downloads.thebiogrid.org/File/BioGRID/Release-Archive/BIOGRID-4.4.210/BIOGRID-ALL-4.4.210.mitab.zip). The gene-by-cell matrix contained an average of 66,395 cells (range 2,638 to 287,269) and 24,064 genes (range 13,714 to 33,694). The interaction network contained 977,356 interactions among 19,752 genes. The scRNA-seq datasets were previously published and can be freely available.

We referred to the classic data division method when training the VGAE model (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.07308v1). The dataset was split according to the positive and negative edges of the interaction network, and the training set and test set are independent. The positive edges (i.e., the element values of the matrix being 1) of the initial adjacency matrix were split by 90%, 5%, and 5% respectively and the same number of negative edges (i.e., the element values of the matrix being 0) were randomly selected to form the training set, validation set, and test set, respectively.	The gene-by-cell matrix contained an average of 66,395 cells (range 2,638 to 287,269) and 24,064 genes (range 13,714 to 33,694). The interaction network contained 977,356 interactions among 19,752 genes. The gene-by-cell matrix were adjusted to be consistent with the nodes of the interaction network. We deleted the genes that were not annotated in the interaction network and used 0 to fill in the node features that lacked feature values. The positive edges (i.e., the element values of the matrix being 1) of the initial adjacency matrix were split by 90%, 5%, and 5% respectively and the same number of negative edges (i.e., the element values of the matrix being 0) were randomly selected to form the training set, validation set, and test set, respectively.	4.0	0.0	Scripts that were used to perform the evaluation are available (https://github.com/LPH-BIG/scGraph2Vec).	Yes, we adopt a unified benchmark framework to compare scGraph2Vec with other gene embedding calculation methods, including scVI, LDVAE, siVAE, scVAE, scGNN, scapGNN, scETM, SAUCIE, and SIMBA.	scGraph2Vec had the highest silhouette coefficients, implying the best module partitioning.	For link prediction, we use AUC and AP indicators for evaluation. For community detection, we use silhouette coefficient for evaluation.	Cross-validation.

Using a 64-core CPU in parallel, the total computation time was about 50 minutes, the peak memory usage was 64 gigabytes.	We demonstrate that gene embedding is biologically interpretable and can reveal functional gene modules representing general or tissue-specific cellular processes.

Its efficiency and accuracy have been demonstrated in existing single-cell embedding methods.	Yes, this information can be found in the Github (https://github.com/LPH-BIG/scGraph2Vec).	For each scRNA-seq dataset, we filtered for genes with a non-zero expression value in at least 3 cells and for cells with at least 200 expressed genes. The originally downloaded count data were transformed to log (counts per million + 1) values and scaled by all cells. 	On average, each scRNA-seq datasets contained 66,395 cells/features (ranging from 2,638 to 287,269) and 24,064 genes/nodes (ranging from 13,714 to 33,694). We used all features after quality control of single-cell data.	Our features are sufficient to train p, therefore over and underfitting should not be an issue.	No, this question is not applicable to our work.	The model has four hyperparameters specific to scGraph2Vec and some general parameters associated with GAE/VGAE. We carried out a hyperparameter sweep to examine the key hyperparameters of scGraph2Vec and the best hyperparameters were determined by using a combination of assessment parameters, including the silhouette coefficient, the number of clusters, and the running time.

676008c869b4c4f264235cc6	The data are released in the https://github.com/SkywalkerLuke 	The data sources include multiple databases, specifically IEDB, CEDAR, VDJdb, ImmunoCode, dbpepneo2.0, and NEPdb. These datasets can be downloaded from Google Drive and have been submitted along with the source code of TransHLA, including both training and testing data.	Independent	The ratio of the training set, validation set, and test set is 7:1:2. For HLA-II epitopes, there are 312,245 positive samples and 312,245 negative samples. For HLA-I epitopes, there are 459,442 positive samples and 459,442 negative samples. The document mentions that an independent validation set was indeed used, but it does not provide the specific number of samples in the validation set. To ensure the rationality of data distribution, the researchers examined the frequency distribution of HLA alleles that bind to peptides in the IEDB database. The results show that the frequency distribution of HLA alleles in the training set, validation set, and test set exhibits highly similar characteristics (see Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 5). Therefore, it can be concluded that the distribution of data types in the training set and test set is similar. The document notes that the distribution of data types for the training set, validation set, and test set has all been visualized. Specifically, Figure 2 shows the distribution of major HLA-I alleles across different datasets, while Supplementary Figure 5 displays the distribution of the top 50 alleles for HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP.	4.0	0.0	No	Yes, a comparison was performed against current SOTA software on benchmark datasets, as well as against simpler baselines. Details of these comparisons can be found in Table 3 and Table 4 of the paper.	Our model significantly improves performance, particularly in specificity, and this improvement is statistically significant.	The performance metrics reported include AUC-ROC, AUC-PRC, accuracy, F1-score, Matthews correlation coefficient, recall, precision, and specificity. These metrics provide a comprehensive and representative analysis, which is consistent with standards in the literature.	The method was evaluated using an independent dataset by splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets in a 7:1:2 ratio. This ensures that the evaluation is based on data that the model has not seen during training.	4.0	1.0	https://github.com/SkywalkerLuke/TransHLA, MIT license	Using an NVIDIA 3080 GPU and a batch size of 128, it takes approximately 1200 seconds to output around 180,000 predictions.	Black Box	classification	4.0	0.0	TransHLA employs a deep learning machine learning algorithm, specifically combining the Transformer architecture with Residue Convolutional Neural Networks (Residue CNN) to predict epitopes presented by HLA molecules. The novelty of this algorithm lies in its utilization of cutting-edge deep learning techniques, such as Transformers and ESM2 embeddings, to enhance prediction accuracy and efficiency. This new approach was chosen over more traditional models due to its higher specificity and sensitivity in identifying immunogenic epitopes and novel epitopes. Moreover, by merging all epitopes into a single positive sample class and using negative samples in a 1:1 ratio during training, this method learns unified epitope features, enabling better differentiation between epitopes and regular peptide sequences. This not only improves prediction accuracy but also significantly reduces the need for chemical experiments, lowering costs, and demonstrating greater robustness and reliability in antigen selection tasks across diverse populations.	Yes, the hyperparameter configurations, optimization schedule, model files, and optimization parameters are reported. You can find this information at the following URL: https://github.com/SkywalkerLuke/TransHLA. The repository includes details about the licensing as well.	The input data consists of sequences. The sequences are encoded using the ESM2 tokenizer, which converts characters into numerical representations. Then, these numerical representations are passed through ESM2 to generate embeddings. This process leverages the advanced modeling capabilities of ESM2 to create high-dimensional representations of the peptide sequences, which are essential for effective machine learning model training.	We use 2 pretrained embedding features (sequence embedding, structure) as input. We do not use feature selection, and we use the deep learning framework for abstract feature extraction.	The number of parameters is quite large, categorizing it as a large model. However, since a portion of these parameters comes from the pre-trained model, which has effectively extracted features in advance, this helps mitigate both overfitting and underfitting. During downstream training, we employed an early stopping mechanism and established conditions for when early stopping should commence, allowing us to save the best-performing model. This approach helps ensure that the model does not overfit to the training data while still maintaining sufficient capacity to learn effectively.	No, the model does not use data from other machine learning algorithms as input. The training data for the initial predictors and the meta-predictor are not clearly stated to be independent of the test data for the meta-predictor. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed that they are independent.	The model uses approximately 700 million parameters. Of these, 650 million parameters are derived from the ESM2 pre-trained model. The remaining parameters are determined based on the size of the ESM2 embeddings and the number of layers in the model.	Yes, overfitting prevention techniques were used. Specifically, we employed a validation set along with an early stopping mechanism. This approach helps monitor the model's performance and stops training when improvements on the validation set cease, effectively preventing overfitting.	8.0	0.0	676005bbdd85bd59b37ec404	40036690.0	PMC11878767	02/02/2026 19:46:52	Lu T, Wang X, Nie W, Huo M, Li S.

The scripts used for this evaluation are part of the gigascience database. 	HVSeeker is shown to outperform other methods on various comprehensive datasets and on different performance metrics. 	We use precision, recall, accuracy and F1-score, ROC-AUC  to fairly compare different methods. 	For optimization runs we used a nested 5-fold CV, ensuring fair assessment of our results due to independent test datasets. When testing HVSeeker-DNA we additionally used subsets of our original independent test-set of different homology conditions to challenge our models. In the last step we test HVSeeker against a novel dataset based on the infant gut metagenome, showing it's utility in a practical setting.	5.0	0.0	The source code is released on github and can be found in the gigascience database aswell (MIT license included). To make it easier to run the scripts, we also supply a conda environment with instructions for easy installation. 	Executing a simple forward pass with one sequence only takes around 0.0366 seconds on a standard machine (cpu only). Prediction time is therfore neglegtible. 	As it is the case with most deep-learning methods, interpretaing the classification results is unfortunately not directly possible. 	The model performs classification. 	4.0	0.0	HVSeeker is based on established machine learning (ML) algorithms, such as LSTM and Transformer, which are known to work well with sequences and have been adapted to our specific problem	The model files, optimization schedule and paramter and hyperparameter configurations are reported and can be found in the gigascience database. 	HVSeeker relies on one-hot encoding but merges data in different ways, such as padding (cycling through the sequence until it reaches the required length), contig assembly (combining multiple shorter sequences to generate a longer sequence, then splitting it into subsequences of 1000 bp), and sliding window (using a window of 1000 bp to slide over the input DNA sequence in 100 bp steps)	Both versions of HVSeeker rely only on the sequence, the input features are therfore the nucleotides/amino acids of the input sequence. No further feature selection was performed.	We evaluate our models during training using a validation set to achieve an optimal fit of the paramters.	HVSeeker-Protein uses input from a pre-trained version of ProtBert. Since ProtBert was previously trained on a masked language task, it had not encountered a classification task prior to this study.	HVSeeker contains 1026152 trainable parameter. The number of parameter is a result of adapting the model to the training process. 	We use early stopping using a validation set and dropout to prevent overfitting to the training data.

"	"This dataset contains annotated images of mature inflorescences, collected from experiments conducted on the Multiparent Advanced Generation Inter-Cross (MAGIC) population for Arabidopsis. These 2D RGB images are in png format, consist of branches of stems with fruits attached. The designated image-based tasks are for quantitative trait extraction for Arabidopsis fruits, and has been used to develop Cascade Mask R-CNN for instance segmentation. The annotations for an image consist of segmentation masks for individual instance of siliques and have been store in COCO format in json files, with only one class of object of interest, i.e. siliques. The number of silique object could vary from none to hundreds. 

This annotation dataset was curated for our AI pipeline for Arabidopsis fruit phenotyping, and has not be used in other work yet. "	The datasets were split randomly form two independent datasets: a training set and a test set without any shared examples between the two. 	"The annotated image dataset has been randomly split into two sets: training (44 images, with 2,288 annotated siliques) and test (11 images, with 652 silique segmentations).
The distributions of the training and test set are similar as they are from the same experiment and imaged under the same condition by a flatbed scanner. 

For the verification of the pipeline using QTL analysis, the full dataset collection (in total of over 7000 images) has been utilised.

The perfermance is also reported in the associated paper, freely available under CC0 license. All the additional evaluation of the model outputs via QTL analysis, including identified loci based on deep learning phenotypic data and known genes (from bioinformatic database and literature), are available on the Github Repository https://github.com/kieranatkins/silique-detector under Open Source Licenses. 	No direct comparison on instance segmentation model is available at the moment, as this is a newly curated dataset for our AI pipeline development. Simpler alternative traits can be extracted using other easier to extract traits, by e.g. semantic segmentation algorithms, however it would not be a precise measurement on the silique morphology, as we hope for this work. 	Experiments for comparison to alternative methods have not been available. However, this development aims to demonstrate the potential of using AI based pipeline to for large scale fruit phenotyping, and we have done so by verifying the model-derived phenotypic outputs through QTL analysis. 	"We evaluated the trained model on an independent test set of 11 annotated images containing 652 siliques, using standard performance metrics for object detection and segmentation. These include Average Precision and Average Recall (with an IoU threshold ranging from 0.5 to 0.95 in increments of 0.05), as well as Precision at IoU thresholds of 0.5 and 0.75.

For independent verification of the instance silique segmentation model, the entire image collection (over 7000 images) was examined through qualitative inspection and QTL analysis to identify links between variability in model-derived fruit morphology phenotypes and the genome. Significant loci were then cross-referenced with known genes and relevant literature."	Original model output were first validated using independent test dataset (of 11 images), followed by applying the model on a much larger dataset of over 7000 images with qualitative visual checking and further QTL analysis on the model derived phenotypic data. 	5.0	0.0	The entire pipeline, docker containerised, including pre-trained models, model inferences, phenotypic data extraction and evaluation, is available at https://github.com/kieranatkins/silique-detector/ under GPL 3.0 license.

Only a few seconds or less are required to inference on the model to generate the segmentation predictions using a single desktop PC with CPU only, it is recommended to run on machine with larger RAM (e.g. 32 GB or above) is recommended. 	This model is a blackbox neural network model, however it's outputs (detected silique instances and corresponding masks) can be plotted overlaying the original images for visual inspection. Examples are given on the associated paper, and also users can easily run through the docker containerised pipeline and generate images with model prediction examples. 	Direct model outputs for the instance segmentation problem include detected bounding boxes and segmentation masks for siliques and their associated confidence scores.	4.0	0.0	We chose Cascade Mask R-CNN for our instance segmentation tasks due to its multi-stage approach, which progressively refines detection, offering higher accuracy and improved handling of scale and occlusion compared to single-stage methods like YOLACT, which prioritise real-time processing over precision. While two-stage methods, including Mask R-CNN, provide a strong balance between detection precision and efficiency, additional integration of attention mechanisms, such as transformer architectures, can further enhance spatially aware segmentation but often require more computational resources and training data. Cascade Mask R-CNN’s ability to refine detections iteratively makes it particularly suitable for the challenges in agricultural imagery, such as dense scenes and varied scales.

We opted for end-to-end deep learning model architecture where features are automatically learned from the data. 	We initialise the weights without any parameter freezing to allow the model to adapt to the largely different domain of our dataset.   The model was trained for 36 epochs, most of the settings are set as default values, using stochastic gradient descent with a learning rate of 0.01. These hyper-parameters were chosen based on the internal validation (randomly split from the training set) performance, i.e. to allow the model to converge well without overfitting. We included an initial linear learning rate warm-up for the first 100 iterations, starting at 0.00001, and ending at the learning rate of 0.01. This was chosen to stop the sharp initial updates from the initial COCO weights, which can lead to instability \citep{glimer21}. The learning rate was set to decay by a factor of 0.1 at epochs 24 and 33 to allow for fine-tuning later in the training. Training took place across 4 GPUs. Batch size was set to 1 image for each GPU. 	No	Underlying Cascade Mask R-CNN, we used a RegNetX 1.6GF backbone \cite{radosavovic20} with a feature pyramid network.

This dataset is widely used and well established in MRI analysis.	Our dataset was split fold-wise into test and train sets randomly. Since the dataset contains some data from siblings, we took care not to split siblings into corresponding train/test pairs.	We used internal cross-validation (k-fold validation) with a k of 128.

Connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) was used as described in [1]. CPM uses simple correlation described by Pearson's r between features (edges of a connectome) and a to-be-predicted measure (in this case, BMI) in the train set. From negative and positive correlations between features and the measure a general linear model is constructed, which is then used to predict the test set's measure.

"	Python code with which the analysis was performed is available under a GPLv3 license and can be accessed through a git respository at https://codeberg.org/tobac/hcp-suite As part of the published paper, a Jupyter notebook is provided with intermediate files (i.e. connectivity matrices)	A preprocessed version of the Human Connectome Project's (HCP) Young Adults dataset was used. While a comprehensive and detailed description has been published elsewhere [1], a concise description of the steps involved is as follows: In a first step, correction for distortions related to gradient nonlinearity (which is more pronounced in the HCP’s scanner setup) was applied with a FreeSurfer software package. The FSL software’s FLIRT method was then used to correct for head motion. Grand-mean intensity normalization was performed on the fMRI time series. One of the keystones of fMRI studies is reliable intersubject comparability, which requires translating a subject’s physical space into a common standard space (”registering”). The HCP addressed this fundamental issue via multimodal registering, i.e. using a variety of imaging modalities to reliably and automati- cally identify anatomical or functional landmarks in each subject’s 3D data and align them accordingly in what they call grayordi- nate space, a derivate of Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, in which only matter of interest (i.e. gray matter) is preserved. Building on work described in [2], Glasser et al. [3] developed a multi-modal and mapped areal-feature-based (dubbed ”MSMAll”) registration method, which uses myelin maps, resting-state brain networks, visuotopic maps, and a subcortical region of interest for inter-subject alignment (see the supplemental methods of [3] for implementation details).  The analysis is a parcellated analysis. For the cerebral cortex, HCP-MMP1.0 (Human Connectome Project Multi- Modal Parcellation version 1.0, [3]) by Glasser et al. was used. They delineated 180 parcels per hemisphere (360 in total) by using the overlap of four areal feature maps, one for each modality (cortical thickness, relative myelin content, tfMRI, rsfMRI). Subcortical parcels were provided by Tian et al. [4]. They relied on subcortical-to-cortical connectivity derived from the HCP’s rsfMRI data to delineate 27 subcortical parcels per hemisphere (54 in total) along connectivity gradients, i.e. sufficiently stark changes in func tional connectivity. Finally, cerebellar parcels came from a HCP-based study which clustered neighboring cerebellar voxels into 100 parcels by means of similarity of their rsfMRI time-series [5].

678fa69f5a9877fd97a7d5dc	The training dataset is available on zenodo (https://zenodo.org/records/10940194) with a CC-BY 4.0 licence. 	"The dataset consists of 155 primary and 155 metastatic melanoma manually selected ROIs, scanned at 40× magnification (0.22 µm/px) with a size of 1024 × 1024 pixels. For these ROIs, annotations of both tissue and nuclei are supplied, as well as a context ROI of 5120 × 5120 pixels centered around the ROI. Annotations were created by a medical expert and checked and corrected by a dermatopathologist.  All cases were digitized in a large melanoma referral center, however 76 cases are revisions or consultations originating from other treatment hospitals. Annotations are in the .GeoJSON format, making annotations easily visualizable with the opensource pathology image viewer Qupath. 

The following nuclei categories were used:  tumor, stroma, vascular endothelium, histiocyte, melanophage, lymphocyte, plasma cell, neutrophil, apoptotic and epithelium and the following tissue categories were used: tumor, stroma, epidermis, necrosis, blood vessel, and background. A total of 147 739 nuclei are manually annotated. "	The sets were split randomly. As each sample is a histological specimen from a different patient the training and test dataset are independent. 	"The PUMA dataset contains 103 primary melanoma ROIs and 103 metastatic melanoma ROIs in the training set, with a total of 97,429 nuclei. 
The test set includes 52 primary melanoma ROIs and 52 metastatic melanoma ROIs, comprising 50,490 nuclei. 

In the manuscript the distribution of metastatic sites, nuclei and tissue annotations is plotted in the data description paragraph.

No publicly available method exists able at segmenting skin tissue on H&E stained histopathology images. "	The results are bootstrapped for generation of confidence intervals. This is not performed in the final public evaluation code for the PUMA challenge due to reducing computational burden. The difference in performance between the used models is statistically significant. 	"For the calculation of the F1 score, the center distance between the predicted nuclei and the ground truth nuclei was used. For each ground truth nucleus, predictions within a 15 pixel (3.3 μm) were identified. This radius is smaller than the average size of lymphocytes, which form the smallest nuclei in the dataset. Matching was performed based on the highest predictive score (if available) or the shortest distance. After matching, the ground truth was censored until all ground truth nuclei were either matched or classified as a false negative. Using the identified true positives, false positives, and false negatives, precision (all correct predictions divided by all predictions) and recall (all correct predictions divided by all ground truth nuclei) were calculated. The class F1 score was computed as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, ranging from 0 to 1. Finally to compare models, micro F1  (aggregation of TP, FP, and FN over all classes, followed by F1 score calculation) and Average F1  (the average of class F1 scores) were calculated [40]. Results are shown with a 95% confidence interval which is calculated through bootstrapping the samples. 

Both models and intra- and interobserver agreement were evaluated using the DICE score. The DICE score is a harmonic mean between 0 and 1, in which 1 is a perfect segmentation prediction, and 0 is no correct prediction. This can result in inflated high average DICE scores if a tissue class is only present in a few samples, as the DICE score is 1 in the case of a correct absent prediction. To accommodate this, we calculated not only the average DICE score over all samples but also the micro average DICE. This is the DICE score for all predictions concatenated along one axis, resulting in a prediction mask of 1024 × 96.256 pixels. Results are shown with a 95% confidence interval which is generated through bootstrapping the sample results. 

Metrics are in line with literature (Maier-Hein, L., Reinke, A., Godau, P. et al. Metrics reloaded: recommendations for image analysis validation.

Segmentation	4.0	0.0	"In this study, two algorithm classes are used. The first class consists of models for nuclei instance segmentation, while the second class includes semantic segmentation models for medical image analysis. The nuclei instance segmentation algorithms offer advantages over classic models due to post-processing techniques like watershed segmentation, which help separate densely packed nuclei. Additionally, these algorithms can be applied to whole slide images instead of tiles. 

For tissue annotation semantic segmentation, two models were used. The first is nnU-Net, which is designed for supervised medical image segmentation. The second is Mask2Former2, a transformer segmentation algorithm which can be used for supervised semantic segmentation. For this experiment the backbone was replaced by a foundation model that is better able at feature extraction from histopathology images.


"	The original training code of the models used was not adjusted. Weights for the baseline solution of the PUMA challenge are supplied on Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/records/13881999). 	Annotations are supplied in the .geoJSON format. For training of Hover-Net and Hover-Next the .geoJSON and .TIFF images were recoded to numpy array masks. For tissue segmentation the .geoJSON were encoded to .PNG masks. 	No explicit feature selection was performed. The models used the raw input from the images without reducing or selecting specific features. Therefore, the entire dataset, including both tissue and nuclei information, was used for training without separate feature selection steps.	In this study, due to the use of different models, it’s hard to directly compare p (parameters) and f (input features) with the number of training points. The models were used to establish a baseline without detailed tuning. Overfitting was countered by 5-fold cross-validation and the use of an independent test set, though specific model-related techniques were not addressed.	No	The models in this research used default configurations for the number of parameters. The goal was to establish a baseline for the dataset, providing a reference point for the PUMA challenge. The community is then invited to improve upon these baseline models in future work. No manual tuning or selection of the number of parameters (p) was performed.	To decrease the risk of overfitting we used data-augmentation and 5-fold cross validation to define a training and validation set in the original training set. We took the mean of these models on the independent test set. 	7.0	1.0	678fa631edf7b65039c6cf91	39970004.0	PMC11837757	02/02/2026 19:46:52	Schuiveling M, Liu H, Eek D, Breimer GE, Suijkerbuijk KPM, Blokx WAM, Veta M.

All individual data captured of each plant, at each timestep, was encapsulated into their own directories. 
The main data consists of RGB images and depth maps of each plant, captured from positions equidistance around the centre of each plant. Each position for each image was recorded and stored as a transform file and COLMAP point cloud, which ensures that these images can be utilised for 3D reconstruction using Neural Radiance Fields, 3D Gaussian Splatting or other supported models/frameworks.
Approximately 320 images and depth maps were captured for each plant instance- this would vary depending on if the robot setup failed to reach some of the positions. For each of the plant instances, we also include all model weights and training parameters, which can be executed using NeRFStudio.
This dataset is novel and is introduced along with the supported manuscript. "	We chose to implement a 8:1 split between our training and evaluation (test) images. These images were added to each set sequentially during capturing, meaning that after 8 training images were captured, the next was added to the evaluation set. Our capturing process takes images around the plant in a linear path, meaning that the evaluation images were evenly distributed around the plant (resulting in accurate evaluation results). These splits are similar to other multi-view image datasets (such as the original NeRF Dataset).	"For each plant, there are around 35 images used for evaluation (284 images for training). These datasets were distributed evenly based on our capturing process (see IV.3).

Neural Radiance Field models utilise a neural network to represent a given scene, meaning that these models are black box.

The only factor that could be considered ""dependent"" between images is the type of histological staining. Other datasets with tissue annotation typically only include one type of stain (often hematoxylin and eosin, e.g., ORCA: https://sites.google.com/unibas.it/orca/home and CAMELYON16: https://camelyon16.grand-challenge.org/) and focus not on segmenting tissue from background, but provide tissue annotations for segmentation areas of medical interest within the tissue area. Therefore, they are not useful for our method which is evaluated to work on different types of staining."	"Since the task is tissue segmentation from images, we applied data splitting at an image level. The model was validated with two strategies to highlight robustness (explanation at ""Evaluation.Evaluation Method)

The final model used by the registration algorithm was trained on a 80/20 split (stratified split to ensure that distributions are similar). No hyperparameter optimization was conducted because the structure of the deep learning model was predefined. "	4.0	0.0	Raw evaluation files have not been made available.	We compared our method to a simpler baseline method (Otsu's thresholding) by performing the same preprocessing steps to the tissue image but using Otsu' thresholding instead of our model.	We have performed a one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test and achieved a p value < 0.0001. Therefore, we make the claim that our method is better than the baseline.	"The reported performance metrics are Hausdorff distance (69.159), Dice Similarity Coefficient (0.979), Precision (0.982), and Recall (0.997).

These are metrics used in the field of Digital Pathology when working in the field of segmentation tissue regions of interest. For instance, see https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2022.971873 and https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers15030762."	"The method was evaluated in two rounds of validation before final training:
1. Stratified Kfold cross validation with a 80/20 split with stratification for each type of staining.
2. Leave-one-tissuetype-out validation (train the model on 3 staining types and leave one staining type out) with a split according to the distribution noted in IV.1. This was done for analyzing the robustness. Example: When testing ""leave-one-tissuetype-out validation"" on immunohistochemistry, 224 images from the other 3 staining groups were used as training and the 61 images of immunohistochemistry were used as a test set.

The final model was trained on a 80/20 stratified split using cross validation."	5.0	0.0	The software is released under the MIT license and can be executed via Python API. It is used a preprocessing step in a registration pipeline. Tutorials for running the registration (and specifically the segmentation portion of the registration) can be found here: https://github.com/mwess/GreedyFHist/blob/master/examples/notebooks/pairwise.ipynb. Example data is available.	The model takes around 1.06 seconds on a desktop PC.	The model is based on a deep learning architecture and is therefore a black box model.	The model performs tissue segmentation which is a form of classification.	4.0	0.0	The ML algorithm is a deep learning architecture based on the pre-existing YOLO8 model (https://yolov8.com/) for segmentation. It was chosen because it is able to perform fast inference on a CPU which complements the rest of our CPU based registration algorithm.	The trained model is incorporated into our registration algorithm, GreedyFHist (https://github.com/mwess/GreedyFHist) and available under the MIT license. Default parameters were used to train the model.	Preprocessing: Images were resampled to a resolution of 640 x 640 and converted to grayscale. Spurious noise from the background of the image was removed using a method by Chambolle et al., that performs total variation denoising. Then we used the YOLO8 model to perform tissue segmentation on the image. After segmentation small artifacts were removed from mask and masks were rescaled to the input images original size.	Each input image consists of 640x640 (409600) pixel. No feature selection was done.	Since we train the model for pixel level classification our training points were 116 736 000 pixels and  3 157 200 parameters (ratio of 0.027). We evaluated our segmentation model with stratified kfold cross validation and leave-one-tissuetype-out validation before training the final model. All models performed similarly. 	No data from other ML algorithms is used as input.	The model was predefined with 3 157 200 parameters. By default, adjusting the number of parameters was not possible and therefore not done.	During training, image augmentation is used to generalize the dataset (Augmentation parameters can be found here: https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/train/#train-settings). Additional augmentation, mosaic augmentation (https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2023/12/mosaic-data-augmentation/) is used as a means of improving the models robustness. This feature was disabled in the last 10 epochs of training (epochs 90 - 100). Because of that, no early stopping was used.	8.0	0.0	67bf7c28edf7b650399238cf	40366868.0	PMC12077394	02/02/2026 19:46:52	Wess M, Andersen MK, Midtbust E, Guillem JCC, Viset T, Størkersen Ø, Krossa S, Rye MB, Tessem MB.

"	In the cross-modal prediction task, we conducted benchmark experiments on the PBMC 10k and NeurlPS datasets. For the PBMC 10k dataset, we randomly divide cells into training (n=9527) and testing (n=2382) sets (bootstrapping five times). For the NeurlPS dataset, we compare with the top five winners from the modality prediction task (ATAC-GEX subtask) using the official settings, datasets, and guidelines from the multimodal single-cell data integration competition of NeurIPS 2021.	In the multimodal integration task, the dataset is not divided into training and test sets because we use unsupervised learning. In the cross-modal prediction task, we use 80% of the cells as the training set and the remaining 20% of the cells as the test set. The data distribution of the training set and the test set is consistent.	4.0	0.0	The evaluation code is shown in https://github.com/melobio/Attune. The evaluation results reported in this paper are available in Supplementary_Table.xlsx.	We benchmark with GLUE, uniPort, Seurat, Cobolt, MinNet, scJoint, MultiVI, sciCAN, Babel and Polarbear on PBMC 10k dataset and SHARE-seq dataset.	The performance metrics have confidence intervals and it can claim that the method is superior to others. We benchmark against other multimodal integration methods on PBMC 10k and SHARE-seq dataset (repeated five times with different random seeds). We benchmark against other cross-modal prediction methods on PBMC 10K and NeurIPS dataset (bootstrapping five times).	Integration endeavors are assessed through an array of metrics, including mean average precision (MAP), cell type ASW, neighbor consistency (NC), Seurat alignment score (SAS), Batch ASW, graph connectivity (GC), biology conservation, omics mixing, overall integration score and FOSCTTM. Most of which have been widely embraced and validated in previous single-cell integration tasks, such as graph connectivity (GC) in the NeurIPS 2021 competition and average silhouette width (ASW) in scJoint and FOSCTTM in MMD-MA.	"To demonstrate the performance of Attune, we benchmark it against other multimodal integration methods (repeated five times with different random seeds) on matched scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq datasets, such as 10x Multiome and SHARE-seq, with several established metrics, most of which have been widely embraced and validated in previous single-cell integration tasks, such as graph connectivity (GC) in the NeurIPS 2021 competition and average silhouette width (ASW) in scJoint. We also quantify the alignment performance between modalities using the Fraction Of Samples Closer Than the True Match (FOSCTTM) on both datasets.
In cross-modal prediction, we compare it against state-of-the-art cross-modal prediction methods such as BABEL and Polarbear, using the 10x Multiome dataset (PBMC10k, n=11,909).

On the PBMC 10k dataset (11909 cells), pre-training takes 30 minutes, cross-modal prediction takes 15 minutes, and inference of gene-peak interaction takes 1 hour. The above time is calculated on a single Quadro RTX 6000 24GB	By employing transformer’s cross-attention mechanism, we can interpretable reveal regulatory interaction of genes and construct gene-peak interaction. Attune employs contrastive learning as a pretraining procedure followed by a transformer decoder to model the relationship between peaks and genes. The transformer is a deep neural network structure for sequence modeling. The self-attention mechanism establishes attention connections between each token in a sequence, so the embedding of each token contains implicit context. Meanwhile, the cross-attention mechanism establishes attention connections between tokens in two sequences, enabling the model to extract the dependency between tokens in the two sequences. Both self-attention and cross-attention are adopted in our model. Self-attention captures intra-modality interaction, such as gene-gene relationships, while cross-attention models inter-modality interaction, which is the peak-gene relationship.	Attune is an unsupervised pre-training model, which consists of two asymmetric teacher-student networks, as well as two modules dedicated to downstream tasks: the cross-modal prediction module and the inference of gene-peak interaction module. The cross-modal prediction module is regression task and the inference of gene-peak interaction module is classification task.	4.0	0.0	"The ML algorithm reported in this paper belongs to an unsupervised multimodal pre-training algorithm, which is a cross-modal contrastive learning pre-training model designed to capture the interactions between different modalities.
In the context of single-cell multi-modal data, this ML algorithm is innovative in that it can capture the interactions between different modalities. By maximizing the agreement between modalities within a cell on the hypersphere. It can also places representations of distinct modalities into a shared feature space, enabling the modeling of interactions between peaks and genes. These capabilities are not available in other known algorithms.
"	Hyperparameter configurations and optimization strategies and model files and optimization parameters are described in detail in https://github.com/melobio/Attune. 	The Attune model takes expression (gene count) and accessibility (peak count) matrices from matched multimodal scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq as input data. For scRNA-seq data, genes expressed in fewer than 5% of cells were filtered out. We used SCANPY to normalize each cell count to 10,000 read counts before the logarithm. Additionally, sex chromosome genes were removed, and 2000 highly variable genes (HVGs) were selected based on the experiments depicted in Figure 2d providing a reasonable compromise. For scATAC-seq data, peaks accessed in fewer than 5% of cells were filtered out. And peaks from sex chromosomes were also filtered out. The normalized expression and accessibility matrices were encoded in the TensorFlow Record (TF-record) format. The scRNA-seq data was encapsulated in one TF-record file, with 'gene index' and 'gene count' fields, while the scATAC-seq data was encapsulated in another file, with 'peak index' and 'peak count' fields.	For scRNA-seq data, there are 2000 features as input, and for scATAC-seq data, there are more than 20,000 features as input. Based on the experiments depicted in Figure 2d and Table S5 providing a reasonable compromise. This choice allows us to achieve satisfactory performance while managing the computational cost and ensuring the overall stability and efficiency of the model. It performed using the training set and testing set.	Attune leverages separate teacher-student networks to learn cell representations from scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq respectively, through cross-modal contrastive learning. Contrast learning is implemented by the explicit comparison of the d-dimensional embedding (where d = 128 by default) of a cell on two modalities on a unit hypersphere.  Positive sample pairs are created by taking two modal representations of a cell and pulling them together, while negative samples are created by taking different cells and widening the distance between them. The above process is quantified using NT-Xent loss (the normalized temperature-scaled cross-entropy loss). To avoid underfitting of the model, we set the minimum batch size to 32. As the number of training iterations increases, the NT-Xent loss will gradually decrease. To avoid overfitting of the model, we set the maximum epoch to 20.	The data input to the model is raw data and has not been processed by other ML algorithms. It is clear that training data of initial predictors and meta-predictor are independent of test data for the meta-predictor.	The parameter that needs to be defined in the model is the dimension of embedding, and we set the dimension of the embedding to 128. Comparative experiments are detailed in Table S6.	To avoid overfitting of the model, we set the maximum epoch to 20.	8.0	0.0	67da3599edf7b65039fddc2c	41105015.0	PMC12532322	02/02/2026 19:46:52	Yang Y, Xie C, He Q, Yang M.

"The training set consists of the CellBinDB dataset, and the test sets consist of two separate datasets: IEEE_TMI_2019 and Lizard.
The training set and the test sets are completely independent. There is no overlap between these datasets in terms of image content or source, ensuring that the models are evaluated on entirely unseen data during testing."	"For our model fine-tuning process:
Training Set: We used the CellBinDB dataset, which contains 1,044 images.
Test Sets: Two separate datasets were used for testing:
IEEE_TMI_2019: Contains 50 images.
Lizard: Contains 238 images.

No separate validation set was used during the fine-tuning of both models (Cellpose and MEDIAR).

Regarding the distribution of data types:
The training set includes images from four different staining types (DAPI, H&E, ssDNA, and mIF), while both test sets only contain images stained with H&E. This difference in staining types between the training and test sets allows us to evaluate the generalization capability of our models on unseen staining types.
In our paper, we have included T-SNE plots that visualize the feature distributions of the datasets. These plots demonstrate that the features in CellBinDB are broadly distributed and cover characteristics from most publicly available datasets. This broad coverage explains why fine-tuning models on CellBinDB improves their performance on third-party datasets they have not seen before, thereby validating the utility and comprehensiveness of our dataset.

685504d91d1a98db540a923e	Yes. All datasets used in this study, including RNA and disease information, known associations, and the 5-fold cross-validation splits, are publicly available. The data will be archived and assigned a DOI in GigaDB upon publication. In addition, key data files and preprocessing scripts are available in the GitHub repository. All data will be shared under an open data license to ensure reusability and transparency.	"The raw data were collected from publicly available and well-established biological databases. miRNA–disease associations were obtained from HMDD v4.0, with sequence data from miRBase. lncRNA and circRNA associations were sourced from LncRNADisease v3.0, with circRNA sequences from circBase and lncRNA sequences from GENCODE and NONCODE. piRNA–disease associations were collected from piRDisease v1.0, and piRNA sequences from piRBase and piRNAdb. Disease terms were standardized using Disease Ontology (DOID) identifiers.

The dataset is structured as a binary classification task, where positive samples are known RNA–disease associations and negative samples are constructed using the spy technique. The total number of positive samples is in the tens of thousands, and negative samples are generated in equal size per fold during cross-validation. These databases are widely used and recognized in the ncRNA research community, although the exact combination and integration presented in this study is novel."	The dataset was randomly split using 5-fold cross-validation. For each fold, training and test sets were strictly separated with no overlapping RNA–disease pairs. This independence was enforced using binary mask matrices that explicitly define which entries are used for training or testing. No additional redundancy reduction (e.g., sequence similarity filtering) was performed. The distribution of positive and negative samples is consistent with previous studies in the ncRNA–disease association domain, and no significant imbalance or bias was observed.	Each fold of the dataset contains approximately 10,000 positive samples for training, along with an equal number of reliable negative samples selected using the spy technique. The test set in each fold includes around 3,000 positive samples and an equal number of randomly sampled negatives, resulting in roughly 6,000 test samples per fold. No separate validation set was used; all evaluation was performed using 5-fold cross-validation. The distributions of data types (RNA categories and disease classes) were kept consistent across folds through random stratified splitting. While data distribution plots were not included, care was taken to ensure balanced representation in both training and test sets.	4.0	0.0	Yes. The raw evaluation outputs, including prediction scores, evaluation scripts, and fold-wise performance logs, are available in the GitHub repository and will be archived in GigaDB upon publication. The evaluation code includes metrics computation, result aggregation, and visualization tools. All resources are released under an OSI-compliant open-source license (e.g., MIT).	Yes. The proposed method was compared against both publicly available methods and simpler baseline models using the same dataset and evaluation protocol. The comparisons were conducted using 5-fold cross-validation to ensure fairness and reproducibility. The results demonstrated that our model achieved superior performance across multiple metrics, confirming its effectiveness over existing alternatives.	Performance metrics were averaged over 5-fold cross-validation, and standard deviations were reported to indicate variability. While formal confidence intervals were not computed, the observed performance improvements over baselines were consistent across all folds. This consistency suggests that the model's superiority is statistically meaningful, although no formal statistical significance tests (e.g., p-values) were conducted.	We report AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve), AUPR (Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve), and Ranking Index (RI) as performance metrics. These metrics are widely used in ncRNA–disease association prediction tasks and are well-suited for imbalanced binary classification problems. AUC and AUPR measure the classifier’s ability to distinguish positive and negative associations, while RI evaluates the ranking quality of predicted associations. This set of metrics is representative and consistent with standard practices in recent biomedical machine learning literature.	The method was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation. Known RNA–disease associations were randomly partitioned into five folds, and in each run, one fold was used for testing while the remaining four were used for training. Reliable negative samples were constructed separately for each fold using the spy technique. No associations from the test set were used during training, ensuring strict separation. Evaluation metrics were averaged across all folds to assess generalization performance.	5.0	0.0	Yes, the full source code is publicly available. It includes training, evaluation, and prediction scripts for the PanGIA model. However, no executable, web server, virtual machine, or container instance is currently provided. The source code is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/qiankunzizairen/PanGIA and will also be archived in GigaDB upon publication. It is released under an OSI-compliant open-source license (e.g., MIT).	A single forward pass to generate predictions for all RNA–disease pairs takes approximately 1 second on an NVIDIA A100 GPU. On a CPU, the same operation may take 15–30 seconds depending on matrix size. During training, each epoch takes around 8–12 seconds on A100. Generating predictions and saving ranked results for one fold takes less than 1 minute in total.	The model incorporates both black-box and interpretable components. While deep neural networks like HAN and MMoE are generally considered black-box models, our architecture allows for some interpretability. Specifically, the gating mechanisms in the Multi-gate Mixture-of-Experts (MMoE) reveal which expert networks are activated for each RNA type, offering insights into task-specific patterns. In addition, the cross-task attention weights highlight how different RNA types influence each other. These components provide interpretable signals that can be visualized and analyzed to better understand the learned biological relationships.	The model performs binary classification. For each RNA–disease pair, it predicts the probability of association, which is then thresholded to classify the pair as associated or not. The output is a score between 0 and 1 for each pair.	4.0	0.0	"The algorithm belongs to the class of graph neural networks (GNNs) and multi-task learning architectures. Specifically, we use a Multi-gate Mixture-of-Experts (MMoE) framework combined with a Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HAN), designed to learn shared and task-specific representations across multiple RNA types (lncRNA, circRNA, miRNA, piRNA). While MMoE and HAN are existing models, this combination is novel in the context of heterogeneous ncRNA–disease association prediction.

We chose this architecture because it allows information sharing across related tasks while maintaining specialization through expert selection. Compared to single-task or flat GNN baselines (e.g., GCN, GAT), this structure improved performance and interpretability across all RNA types."	Yes. All hyperparameter configurations, optimization settings, and model files (including trained weights and training scripts) are publicly available in the GitHub repository and will be archived in GigaDB upon acceptance. The GitHub repository includes the training script with command-line arguments for hyperparameters, and configuration values are documented in the README. Trained model files (.pt) and cross-validation scores are included in the `scores/` directory. The code is released under an OSI-compliant open-source license (e.g., MIT or Apache 2.0).	The ncRNA–disease data were represented as a heterogeneous graph with multiple relation types (miRNA–disease, lncRNA–disease, circRNA–disease, piRNA–disease). Each node type (RNA, disease) was assigned initial feature vectors. For RNAs, one-hot encodings of sequence types or statistical features (e.g., k-mer counts) were used where applicable; for diseases, semantic embeddings derived from the DOID ontology were used. All features were normalized. The adjacency matrix was binarized (1 for known association, 0 otherwise), and reliable negative samples were generated using the spy technique. Masks were used to define training and test regions in the matrix.	Each RNA and disease node is represented by a fixed-length feature vector. For RNAs, the input feature dimension is typically 64 or 128 depending on configuration; for diseases, features were projected to the same dimension using a linear layer. In total, the feature dimension per node is f = 128. No explicit feature selection was performed. All features were retained and used as input. The input features were derived from domain knowledge (e.g., sequence encodings, ontology embeddings) and not learned from the training set alone.	Yes, the number of trainable parameters (p ≈ 1–2 million) is larger than the number of training points in each fold, and the feature dimension (f ≈ 128) is also relatively high. To reduce overfitting risk, we applied multiple strategies: dropout layers were used throughout the model (including attention and expert modules), early layers were regularized, and 5-fold cross-validation was used for evaluation. Additionally, no test data was used during training, and performance was monitored across folds to ensure consistency. The model showed stable generalization across folds, indicating overfitting was effectively controlled.	No, the model does not use the outputs of other machine learning algorithms as input. All predictions are directly generated from the original input features (node attributes and edge structure) within a unified end-to-end architecture. There is no meta-predictor stage, and no stacking or ensembling of separate models was performed. The 5-fold cross-validation ensures strict separation between training and test data.	The model has approximately 1.2 to 2.0 million trainable parameters, depending on the chosen hidden dimensions, number of experts, and expert layer size. The total parameter count includes the HAN encoder, expert networks, gating layers, and attention modules. The values of hyperparameters (e.g., hidden_dim, expert_dim, num_experts, num_heads) were manually selected based on validation performance using 5-fold cross-validation. No exhaustive grid search was conducted; instead, we evaluated a small set of reasonable configurations based on prior work and model capacity considerations.	Yes, multiple regularization techniques were applied to prevent overfitting. Dropout layers were used in both the expert networks and attention modules. L2 regularization was applied implicitly via the optimizer. Additionally, the model’s multi-task structure (MMoE) encourages parameter sharing and reduces the risk of overfitting to any single RNA type. While early stopping was not explicitly applied, 5-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate generalization, and no test data was used during training.	8.0	0.0	6852b52ae5963d3a24a8dce1	41105014.0	PMC12532321	02/02/2026 19:46:52	Liu X, Lü X, Chen Q, Sun J, Zhao T, Zhu Y.

688fc2386163a9cb4ff9f33f	Yes, the datasets used in this study have been made publicly available for reproducibility and further research. They are hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/wenmm/EssSubgraph/tree/main/data. The data are shared under the GPL v3 license.	The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was obtained from publicly available databases such as STRING (source of string_net.txt), which is widely recognized and used in bioinformatics research. Node features were generated by performing PCA on a processed TCGA gene expression dataset (cancer_full_expression_pc50.csv) that was compiled and curated by previous studies from the TCGA public resource. Class labels indicating essential (positive) and non-essential (negative) genes were obtained from a summary file from DepMap, a widely used database. The dataset includes 2,299 essential genes (Npos) and 10,723 non-essential genes (Nneg). It is designed for classification tasks and does not contain real-valued outputs for regression. While the cancer_full_expression_pc50.csv feature file was generated in this study, it is from direct transformation of TCGA expression matrix, which is widely used in the cancer research community.	The dataset was split using stratified 5-fold cross-validation to ensure independence between training and test sets in each fold. Specifically, genes were partitioned so that no gene appeared in both training and test sets within the same fold, thus maintaining non-overlapping sets. Similar to our approach, other gene classification methods such as EMOGI and MTGCN (both used as benchmark methods in this study) also employ cross-validation strategies to split data into training and test sets. Cross-validation provides a robust framework for performance evaluation by ensuring that each sample is tested while maintaining independence between training and testing data within each fold. This approach is widely used in the community for gene-level prediction tasks, especially when datasets are limited in size or exhibit class imbalance. Therefore, our use of stratified cross-validation aligns with established practices in similar studies.	"We employed a stratified 5-fold cross-validation strategy to evaluate model performance. 80% of the data were allocated for training and 20% for testing. Within the training subset, 90% was used for final training and 10% for validation, which was utilized for model tuning and early stopping. Although the original label data consist of 2,299 essential genes (Npos) and 10,723 non-essential genes (Nneg), the actual number of genes involved in training varies depending on the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, as not all genes are present in every network. For instance, in the STRING network, only a subset of genes is retained after filtering based on network inclusion.

Given that non-essential genes outnumber essential genes by more than fourfold, and that the number of available genes varies across networks, direct training would suffer from a class imbalance problem, potentially resulting in poor predictive performance on the minority (essential) class. To mitigate this, we adopted a resampling strategy whereby, for each training, validation, and test split, all essential genes were included alongside randomly selected non-essential genes at a 1:4 ratio. Using the STRING network as an example, this procedure yielded 6,048 genes in the training set, 972 in the validation set, and 1,680 in the test set. Because the splits were dynamically generated in each fold, we did not plot the distributions explicitly, but the stratification process guarantees that the class balance is consistent across training, validation, and test sets."	4.0	0.0	Yes, the raw evaluation files—including assignments for comparison and baselines, statistical code, and data—are available. They can be found at https://github.com/wenmm/EssSubgraph/tree/main/baseline. We have provided a README file there with instructions on how to run these baseline methods.	We did not evaluate our method on publicly available benchmark datasets, as existing essential gene prediction methods such as XGEP and DeepHE typically use their own specific datasets. However, we applied our method to the dataset used by XGEP and achieved superior performance compared to their results. Additionally, we included comparisons to simpler baseline models to demonstrate the improvements brought by our approach. Although we did not use publicly available benchmark datasets, we performed comparisons on the same dataset with several graph-based models including GCN, GAT, EMOGI, and MTGCN. Additionally, we compared our method against traditional approaches such as DeepWalk and SVM. These comparisons demonstrate the superior performance of our method across multiple baselines.	We used 5-fold cross-validation and conducted 10 rounds, obtaining 50 sets of data. The average performance was shown as a heatmap, and for the data with perturbations, we created a line plot with error bars. The data underlying the line plot with error bars showed statistical significance of the superior performance. 	We report commonly used classification performance metrics, including Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) and Precision-Recall Area Under the Curve (PRAUC). These metrics are widely accepted in the literature for evaluating binary classification tasks. Our reported metrics are consistent with those used in comparable studies such as EMOGI and MTGCN (both used as benchmark methods in this study), facilitating direct comparison and demonstrating the competitiveness of our approach.	The method was evaluated using stratified 5-fold cross-validation to ensure robust assessment of model performance. 	5.0	0.0	Yes, the source code was released in github (https://github.com/wenmm/EssSubgraph/tree/main), we provide methods to run the algorithm using both Docker containers and Conda environments. The Docker image and Conda environment files are available in our GitHub repository, released under the GPL v3 license.	Each epoch takes approximately 1–2 seconds to complete.  Experiments were run on a workstation with an AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3960X 24-core CPU, an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU, and 256 GB of RAM.	The graph neural network (GNN) models used in this study are not inherently interpretable and require additional methods to enhance their interpretability.	The model is a classification model. It is designed to predict whether a given gene is essential or non-essential, which is a binary classification task.	4.0	0.0	The machine learning approach used in this study falls within the class of graph neural networks (GNNs). While graph neural networks themselves are not new, they possess previously unexplored advantages for node classification tasks, especially when integrating multi-omics data and protein-protein interaction networks. This makes GNNs particularly well-suited for essential gene prediction, as they effectively capture both network topology and complex biological features that other methods struggle to model.	Yes, the parameters are reported in the script (https://github.com/wenmm/EssSubgraph/blob/main/EssSubgraph.py). The code is released under the GPL v3 license.	The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was represented as a graph where nodes correspond to genes and edges represent interactions. Node features were derived from gene expression data, which were first processed by principal component analysis (PCA) performed on TCGA gene expression (gene-sample) matrix curated by previous studies. After PCA, we applied min-max scaling to normalize node feature values to a [0, 1] range. For each gene, its expression-based feature vector was combined with its topology in the PPI network to provide the input for the graph neural network. Label data (essential vs. non-essential) were encoded as binary classes (1 for essential, 0 for non-essential). Prior to training, data splits were performed using stratified cross-validation, ensuring balanced representation of classes. 	We evaluated the test set PRAUC across different PCA dimensions and selected 𝑓= 50 features as it achieved the best performance. Given that benchmark methods EMOGI and MTGCN both use 64 features and the performance difference between 50 and 64 features is minimal, we chose 50 from a model performance analysis perspective to provide a clear rationale for our selection.	In our study, the number of trainable parameters p is moderately higher than the number of training samples. For example, under the STRING network setting, the training set contains around 6,000 genes. We only use 50 node features so our model does not fall into the regime where f > 100. To prevent overfitting, we applied several strategies, including stratified cross-validation, early stopping based on validation performance, dropout, and L2 regularization. These techniques help the model generalize effectively. Conversely, to avoid underfitting, we tuned the model’s complexity (e.g., number of layers and hidden channels). The consistent results across validation folds suggest that the model's capacity is appropriate for the task.	Our model does not use predictions from other machine learning algorithms as input.	There are 95,361 trainable parameters in the model. They are trained with gradient descent and a loss function defined by the deviation from experimental data. The model also includes a set of commonly used hyperparameters such as the number of layers, hidden dimensions, dropout rate, learning rate, L2 regularization weight, and whether to use batch normalization. These settings were kept consistent with previous related studies to ensure fair comparison, and were not extensively tuned for performance optimization.	Yes, we used stratified cross-validation, early stopping based on validation set, dropout, and L2 regularization.	8.0	0.0	688fc238e5963d3a24f1720b	41134033.0	PMC12690466	02/02/2026 19:46:52	Wen H, Carpenter S, McGinnis K, Nelson A, Smith K, Hong T.

65f598d51502715bfe53d2d8	The data supporting the results and software in this article are available in the ‘VirHost’ GitHub repository, (https://github.com/GreyGuoweiChen/VirHost). All data and code is covered under a MIT License. The analytic code is accessible from the GigaDB.	We collected 6,735 RNA viruses from Virus-Host Database and 126,417 records with host annotations from NCBI GenBank, both of which are widely used database. After the careful data preprocessings, including de-replication and removal of ambiguous host annotations, we finally got 14500 RNA viruses, spanning 30 virus orders and 12 host groups, including Invertebrate, Viridiplantae, Fungi, Bacteria, Primates, Rodentia, Artiodactyla, Carnivora, Other mammalia, Aves, Reptilia, and Fish. We also evaluated our method in a set of newly-identified RNA viruses, whose hosts are derived based on experimental evidence. The set includes 126 RNA viruses and were collected from various hosts, including Plant, Invertebrate, Fungi, and Fish. The dataset is complied from 20 publications.	We evalaute the model by cross-validation, leave-one-genus-out experiment and recently-identified viruses, which are not included in the training data. In all datasets, the training and test sets are independent. Before the evaluation, we remove the data redundancy to be less than 90% coverage and 80% identity. In leave-one-genus-out experiment and recently-identified viruses, the sequence identity between training and test set is even lower. 	"We first evalute the learning architecture by stratified 5-fold cross validation. The viruses in corresponding virus orders are stratified splited into 5 folds by their labels, with 4 folds as training set and 1 as test set. We evaluated the models on each fold and average the results. There is no duplicate samples between the training and test datasets. 
Besides, we evaluated the models by conducting leave-one-genus-out experiments. Specifically, we used one genus as test set and viruses from other genuses as training set to assess the generalizability of the models. There are 448 virus genera in total. This experiment is a strong demonstration of the generality of the model; no viruses of the same genus are distributed in both the training and test data. "	4.0	0.0	They are availble in the GigaDB and supplementary information.	Yes, we set the alignment-based method, BLASTN, as the baseline model. We then further comared VirHost with various available learning-based methods and validated the outperforming accuracy of VirHost.	We evaluated all the benchmark models across virus orders by their accuracy distribution. VirHost outperformed any other models from the average accuracy.

These metrics are widely used in previous studies, like DOI:10.1126/science.aap9072 and doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btab33 .	We extensively assessed the models by stratified 5-fold cross evaluation, leave-one-genus-out experiment, and recently-identified novel RNA viuses.	5.0	0.0	It can be access by https://github.com/GreyGuoweiChen/VirHost	It takes around 5 seconds to run the test cases (3 viruses) on a normal desktop PC.	The models are black box models. But we provide the evidence and different confidence level of our predictions to users.	We build hierarchical classification models for each virus order.	4.0	0.0	We designated XGBoost as the learning architecture out of its superiors accuracy and training efficiency. To validate our choice, we conducted an evaluation of several learning architectures, encompassing XGBoost, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine with RBF kernel (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB). Using the scikit-learn and xgboost package, default parameters were employed to train these models, and their performance was assessed using accuracy as the evaluation metric.	"All of the model configuration can be easily access from the scikit-learn and xgboost documentation. If you wanna check the parameters of our models, you may load the models by pickle package and used the command ""model.get_xgb_params()"""	We encode the query sequences by their genomic traits and sequence homology. Specifically, we encode the sequences into a (137+m) dimensional vector as the input to models, where m is the number of host labels in the corresponding virus order and model layer. The genomic traits is vectorized as a 137-dimensional vector. To encode the m feature, we first group the reference viruses by their host labels, and then align the query virus against the reference viruses. The highest similarity score against each group is kept to be the corresponding feature value.	Two groups of feature are used as input, 137 genomic traits and the viral sequence homology. Although we did feature selection, we simply compared the feature contribution and model accuracy between the 137 genomic tratis and the codon pairs groups. This is done in the cross validation experiment. For a fair comparison, we removed all of the codon pair scores without using any relatively important ones, which will not result in the data leakage.	We did not focus on ruling out overfitting or underfitting. However, it is worth noting that the parameter count of XGBoost is typically lower than that of neural networks. Additionally, XGBoost incorporates L2 regularization by default, which helps mitigate the risk of overfitting.	No.	For all of the above-mentioned models, we use the default hyperparameters from scikit-learn and xgboost library to train.	XGBoost incorporates L2 regularization by default, which helps mitigate the risk of overfitting. Besides, we adopted the early stop strategy by evaluating the prediction probability of our models. We set probability cutoff for each model to distinguish predictions with low confidence.	7.0	1.0	65f410ad92c76639b816bef8	39172545.0	PMC11340644	02/02/2026 19:46:52	Chen G, Jiang J, Sun Y.

Boruta feature selection (Kursa and Rudnicki (2010) J. Statist. Softw. Artic. 36, 1–13) and minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) method (Peng et al (2005) IEEE Transact. Patt. Anal. Mach. Intel. 27, 1226–1238) were used, to evaluate the importance of each feature. Key features were then selected, and fed into the incremental feature selection (IFS) with supervised classifiers to identify the optimal gene signatures for screening different TCs.   The IFS was run with SVM, RIPPER, and RF, respectively.   The optimal numbers of features turned out to be 169 (SVM), 159 (RF), 38 (RIPPER).
"	After SMOTE application, the number of datapoints was 624.    The Authors first used Boruta to select relevant features, resulting in 237 features (genes). After mRMR and IFS, the subsets of features with the optimal classification performance were obtained.  The numbers of features were 169 (SVM), 159 (RF), 38 (RIPPER).     Given the very high Accuracy (>= 0.979) and MCC (>= 0.934) values, obtained with all three classifiers, the methods seem to be at risk of overfitting.   While the high number of features could be a reason for the probable overfitting in SVM and RF, the RIPPER model might eventually have had different sources of overfitting.

Class negative: putatively neutral insertion/deletion variants. Unclear but likely: 2,392.

Determination of exact number of training and test data points is difficult to ascertain due to poor alignment with numeric figures provided in the text to that of Table 2 which contains this information.

Neither sets of numbers align exactly to the text and no clear key/description provided. 

Dataset reuse/community recognised: data used is a subset of avilable data from reputable international databases. Large variety of databases leveraged and combined for training and test data."	"How were the sets split?: 
For the training data:
-Validation set (25%): A quarter of the training data is used to fine-tune the model during training (resilient propagation method).
-Cross-validation (10-fold): The training data is divided into 10 folds. The model is trained on 9 folds and tested on the remaining one, repeated 10 times, to assess generalisability (AUC-ROC).

Are the training and test sets independent?: 
Yes, indpendent test and training sets used.

How does the distribution compare to previously published ML datasets?:
MutPred-Indel is compared to three existing methods: DDIG-in, VEST-Indel, and CADD  but it uses the training data from the current study, not entirely independent datasets. The paper notes a 'paucity' of such data."	"Training data set comprised of:
-5606 single residue deletions
-1033 single residue insertions
-2427 multi-residue insertions
-3052 multi-residue deletions
-1253 complex indel variants

Test data sets: 
2x test data sets were used to test the models classification efficacy.
1. Somatic mutation test sets: consisting of two sets of putatively damaging cancer causing somatic variants derived from information in COSMIC AND dbCID databases. Text seems to indicate 576 test data points based on the final sentence '(n = 576)' but not clear or explictly stated/documented in text.

Data sourced from REACH Project (2650 families) and the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC). Final test set after filtering is performed is composed of 1217 candidate de novo indels in 827 offspring (506 cases, 321 controls).

"Yes, the evaluation of MutPred-Indel included comparisons to both simpler baselines and publicly available methods.

Simpler baseline: authors compared MutPred-Indel to MutPred2. They achieved this by simulating deletions and insertions using MutPred2 and showed that MutPred-Indel outperformed MutPred2 in this scenario (AUC of 0.903 vs 0.797)

Comparison to publicly available methods: authors also compared MutPred-Indel to other indel prediction methods like VEST-Indel and DDIG. MutPred-Indel achieved the highest AUC (0.897) compared to VEST-Indel (0.875) and DDIG-in (0.869). "	Confidence intervals are not explicitly mentioned in the text.

In the text there are reasonable descriptions of the model but given the lack of publicly available model & code (eg: in Huggingface/other model hosting/no GitHub) and exact training & test datasets. It is somewhat of a blackbox if attempting to reproduce and interpret the exacts of the model given its complex ML algorithm nature being that of an ensemble of neural networks from the text alone.

No, not clearly available from the text or software website. Regarding parameters reporting, the text does note: 'Each pathogenicity predictor was developed with the Matlab 2016b Neural Network Toolbox as an ensemble of one hundred bagged two-layer feed-forward neural networks, where the following training parameters were not varied between alternative models'.

Precise number of input features not explicitly stated in main publication text. The structural and functional features of protein sequences are detailed in Table 3 of the text and fall into 5x categories with approximately 57 noted across these categories. 	Provided that the feature information and inferred parameter infromation (not easy to discern from text), the risk of overfitting is not very likely due to N >> p and the validation set. For underfitting this is mitigated by minimal feature reduction and 10-fold cross-validation employed, but this is dependent on significance of the features and risk grows if the features used are not significant enough. 	No	Without the precise feature count the number of parameters cannot be exactly determined. However, if to use the estimated number of features from Table 3 in the text (57 features from total of 5x categories), it could be inferred that with a network architecture of a two-layer feed-forward neural network with 10 hidden units would be 591.

Are the training and test sets independent?: yes 

How was this enforced:  pairwise sequence identity was taken into consideration.  Clustering sequences to avoid similar sequence identities in test considered. Authors address issue of sequence identity in biological data sets and sequence similarity is carefully controlled.

How does the distribution compare to previously published ML datasets?: using standard CASP14 rules this aligns to all other models participating in the competition. CASP has long history of addressing distribution of proteins in test.  "	"Data splits:

The method is compared to six advanced methods.	No, they don't.	We report FOSCTTM and label-transfer accuracy (LTA) because together they capture the two complementary aspects of multimodal alignment emphasized in recent literature. FOSCTTM is a pairwise metric: it asks whether each individual cell’s true counterpart in the other modality is indeed its nearest neighbour in the joint space, providing a fine-grained measure of geometric alignment that is sensitive to global distortions. LTA, in contrast, is a group-level metric: it checks how well discrete biological labels propagate across modalities, reflecting the preservation of local neighbourhood structure that underlies downstream analyses such as clustering or trajectory inference. hese two metrics are standard in state-of-the-art studies on single-cell alignment (e.g. SCOT, UNIPORT) and are widely regarded as jointly representative of alignment quality.

Six infants with a GMA score of 3 (“atypical fidgety”) were also excluded, since there were not enough infants in this group for model training/testing, and movement patterns differ from those of “absent fidgety” infants.

Six infants with a GMA score of 3 (“atypical fidgety”) were also excluded, since there were not enough infants in this group for model training/testing, and movement patterns differ from those of “absent fidgety” infants. The remaining 931 videos were split into an analysis set (739) and a lock box holdout set (186) (Figure 1, Figure 2). The analysis set was further split into train/val/test sets (648, 93, 186), each of which had a 10-12% representation of the “absent fidgety” movement type. The splits were stratified to preserve the ratios of boy/girl infants, as well as age, and race/ethnicity. There was a total recording duration of 60-120 s per infant.	4.0	0.0	All model outputs and CV scores are available. 	AutoML already tests simple baselines to ensure they do not out-perform the selected model. Additionally, the model was tested against another available model for predicting risk from infant video (STAM).	Performance metrics are reported with associated cross-validation scores. The goal of the paper was not the claim that the result is superior to that of others, but rather to show that the result persists even when applying strict rigorous ML approaches. 	Two standard measures are report: AUC-ROC which is a standard measure used in the machine learning community, and Preicision-Recall (PR)-AUC, which is more interpretable within the medical literature as it relates to the sensitivity/specificity measures that are widely used. 	Two evaluation strategies were used. First, 10 times 5-folds cross validation were performed on the train/test data to ensure that model performance was not reliant on any one specific data split. Finally, the model was evaluated on a lock-box, pre-registered held out test set of participant data to show generalizability. 	5.0	0.0	Yes, the source code is available on GitHub (https://github.com/KordingLab/predict-scores-from-video) under an MIT License.

AutoSklearn-2.0 employs a meta-learning approach to automate the selection and tuning of well-established machine learning algorithms like decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines. The final model selected was Stochastic Gradient Descent. "	All hyper parameters are available in the stored model details, which are available on the pre-registration site: 	All data used for training was numerical, and pre-processed to remove missing values. All other parameters of the data pre-processing and encoding were determined by AutoSklearn 	38 features were used as input. No feature selection was performed - features were determined by medical specialists and pre-registered in advance of any data collection or analysis. 	The number of training datapoints (> 600) is much larger than the number of features (38). Additionally, AutoML mitigates the risk of overfitting by abstracting away any feature and model parameter selection. Moreover, the trained model was evaluated on a lock-box holdout set of data after pre-registration to determine generalizability. 	The model does not use data from other ML algorithms as input. The inputs to the classifier are the features derived from the pose-estimate time-series data, which rely on ViTPose-H. 	p was selected by the AutoML optimizer based on the classification algorithm selected. The search space was restricted to choosing the best model as opposed to an ensemble, in this case SGD, so p corresponds to the weights given to each of the 38 features. 	AutoML was the primary approach used to prevent the risk of overfitting. 	8.0	0.0	6786955bdd85bd59b3220ba6	40666343.0	PMC12262795	02/02/2026 19:46:52	Melanie Segado, Laura A. Prosser, Andrea F.

The accompanying metadata includes information on the hospital and year of data collection, necessary to reproduce the splits.	"The publicly available DRIAMS dataset [1] consists of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry data collected from patients in the Swiss healthcare system. This dataset includes data from four distinct diagnostic laboratories, collected from 2015 to 2018: University Hospital Basel (designated as DRIAMS-A), Cantonal Hospital Basel-Land (DRIAMS-B), Cantonal Hospital Aarau (DRIAMS-C), and the Viollier laboratory service provider (DRIAMS-D). The MALDI-TOF mass spectra used in this project were originally published as part of the study by Weis et al. [2].

In each split, the test set was drawn under a different condition: a different hospital in the hospital zero-shot setting, and a different year in the year zero-shot setting.	"In total, 631,167 observations were leveraged: 11,610 in A2015; 138,132 in A2016; 179,334 in A2017; 123,558 in A2018; 32,377 in B2018, 47,586 in C2018; and 98,570 in D2018. 
Two main data splits were created: 
1. Hospital zero-shot split: Select data from the DRIAMS dataset collected in 2018. Let i, j ∈ {A, B, C, D} represent the hospitals in the dataset. Train the model on data from hospital i. Test the model on data from hospital j, where j!= i.
2. Year zero-shot split: Select data from the DRIAMS A. Let i, j ∈ {2015, 2016, 2017, 2018} represent the year of data collection. Train the model on data from year i. Test the model on data from year j, where j!= i.

"Data bias exists within DRIAMS-A due to one particular workstation (HospitalHygene), where samples were captured using a different medium and skewed heavily toward resistant samples. Following Weis et al. [1], we excluded data from this workstation to mitigate potential biases. The spectra were binned using a bin size of 3 m/z units.

None of the encoding techniques leverage the resistance/susceptibility outcome during feature construction. The total number of features varies from 1,280 (MAE embeddings of dimension 512 combined with Molformer embeddings of dimension 768) to 30,160 (6000-dimensional spectra combined with 24,160-dimensional SELFIES encodings).	The number of parameters is larger than the number of training points. Overfitting was addressed through early stopping, dropout, weight decay, and validation monitoring (see below)	"We compare two pathogen representations: binned MALDI-TOF mass spectra and encodings generated by masked autoencoders (MAEs). 

We compare three types of antimicrobial representations: traditional molecular fingerprints, encodings generated by Molformer transformer-based model for molecular representation learning [1], and SELF-referencing embedded strings (Selfies) [2].

The input projections encodes the MALDI TOF spectra and the antimicrobials encodings into 512-dimensional vectors, which are then concatenated. The model consists of 5 residual blocks, including ReLU activation, a linear layer of dimensionality 1024, a dropout layer with probability 0.2, and a BatchNorm layer. The ResMLP is trained with early stopping with a patience parameter of 10 epochs using an Adam optimiser with a learning rate of 3∗10−4 and a weight decay of 10−5. With the 6000-dimensional binned MALDI-TOF mass spectra and Morgan molecular fingerprints, the ResMLP model has 218M trainable parameters.	Early stopping was employed to halt training if the validation loss did not improve in consecutive epochs, preventing the model from over-optimizing on the training set. Additional regularization was introduced via dropout within residual blocks (with a probability of 0.2) and weight decay (L2 regularization with a factor of 1e-5) to discourage overly complex models. The best model was selected based on validation performance, ensuring generalizability.	8.0	0.0	68f216dbe5963d3a2463ff6a	41553357.0		02/02/2026 19:46:52	Duroux D, Meyer PP, Visoná G, Beerenwinkel N.

APOD takes protein sequence as the only input and processes it in two steps to produce prediction for every residue. The first step involves use of several third-party programs to provide a rich sequence profile that characterizes relevant (putative) structural properties of the input chain. More precisely, these properties include the amino acid composition (AAC) extracted directly from the input sequence, CONS generated with PSI-BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997), putative SS and the relative solvent accessibility (RSA) predicted with SPARKS-X (Yang et al., 2011) and putative intrinsic disorder derived from the DISOPRED3 prediction (Meszaros et al., 2018), which includes the sliding window-based representation of disorder (SWdis) and protein-level DisCon value.	They use the popular RBF kernel and they optimize values of two parameters: complexity constant C and width of the kernel γ. They set their values to 2i where i = −5, −4, …, 5. They also optimize the sliding window size ws by considering the values ranging between 9 and 25; the two values correspond to the 10 percentile and the median length of DFL in the training dataset, respectively. They select the optimal values for ws, C, γ  by maximizing the average AUC values calculated over the five test folds in the 5-fold cross validation on the training set TR166.

In the first layer, they represented every residue by its AA type, its physicochemical properties estimated based on the AA indices from the AAindex database ( Kawashima et al. , 2008 ), secondary structure predicted with PSIPRED ( Buchan et al. , 2013 ), intrinsically disordered and structured regions predicted with IUPred ( Dosztányi et al. , 2005 ) and sequence complexity computed with SEG. In the second layer, they generated numerical features that quantify the considered structural and sequence-based properties for each residue of the input AA sequence. they represented every residue by a feature vector calculated from a sliding window centered on that residue. The sliding window aggregates structural and sequence-based information by considering characteristics of AAs adjacent in the sequence. Consequently, they normalize values of features computed over the residues in the window by the size of the window. In total, they considered 2236 features including 40 features derived directly from the sequence, 2124 features derived from physicochemical properties of AAs quantified based on the AAindex database, 22 features generated from the putative secondary structure, 40 features from putative intrinsic disorder and structured regions and 10 features from the sequence complexity.

Following the annotation protocol from, they first cluster these 2303 sequences using CD-HIT with 100% sequence identity. They set the longest chain in a given cluster as a representative sequence and transfer annotations of LIPs in a given cluster into this chain. Altogether, this procedure introduces 69 additional LIP residues when compared with the annotation without the transfer, i.e. 0.19% increase in the amount of LIP annotations; Supplementary Materials provide further details. Second, they group the resulting 2285 sequences into 1440 clusters by applying CD-HIT with 25% sequence identity threshold, and select the longest sequence to represent each cluster. They divide these sequences into a training dataset TR1000 and a test dataset TE440 at random. The TR1000 dataset is composed of 1000 proteins that have 1380 LIPs (average of 1.38 LIP per protein) and 24 821 amino acids in the LIP regions. The remaining 440 proteins, which cover 612 LIPs (average of 1.39 LIP per protein) and 11 994 residues in the LIP regions, constitute the TE440 dataset.	CD-HIT with 25% redundancy was used.

The three types of inputs include co-evolutionary information (COEV), physiochemical characteristics of amino acids that are relevant to binding (PHYS) and disorder prediction generated with the popular DISOPRED3 method [81]. We produce these inputs at the residue level, combine them together into a 3-dimensional vector and process the resulting vector using sliding windows to produce inputs for the logistic regression.		The model uses outputs from DISOPRED3. 	They use logistic regression to combine the COEV, PHYS and disorder prediction inputs. They parametrize this model by identifying a favorable value of the ridge parameter based on the 5-fold cross-validation on the TR1000 dataset. More specifically, we consider ridge = 10^n where n = −5, −4, ……4, 5 and select the ridge value = 0.1 that produces the highest average AUC that we calculate over the five AUC scores from the five test folds in the cross-validation experiment.	5 fold cross validation was used. 	6.0	2.0	66c495857089c469b477b4ce	36458437.0		02/02/2026 19:46:52	Peng Z, Li Z, Meng Q, Zhao B, Kurgan L.

The other dataset was a 90% redundancy reduced subset of high resolution X-ray structures chains from PDB derived from PISCES. Chains shorter than 25 amino acids were discarded. Missing residues, including those with occupancy equal to zero, were treated as disordered.

For binding prediction in the disordered regions, A set of 840 peptides, with lengths between 5 and 25 amino acids and solved in complex with globular protein domains, was initially obtained from a previous study (Disfani et al., 2012). They discarded 196 peptides that couldn’t be mapped onto UniProtKB (UniProt,2014) sequences with SIFTS (Velankar et al., 2013)—because they were synthetic constructs, or the PDB files had been superseded, or the ATOM records mapped onto discontinuous fragments. They also removed 247 chains sharing 30% or more sequence identity to other regions, based on the BLASTP alignments generated with the recommended settings for short peptides (-seg no -matrix PAM30 -gapopen 10 -gapextend 1 -word_size 3). The positive training set was therefore made up of 5501 amino acids from 397 regions occurring in as many PDB chains (372 UniprotKB sequences).

Among the six base methods, five models were derived from the field of natural language processing, including CAN , HAN , IDP-Seq2Seq , CNN-LSTM , and LSTM-CNN . CAN used the convolutional attention network to obtain the discrete distribution patterns of SDRs in protein sequences. HAN employed the hierarchical attention model to capture the sequence location of LDRs mainly located in the N’ and C’ of the sequences. IDP-Seq2Seq combined Seq2Seq and attention mechanism to capture the global and non-local correlation features of residues in IDRs. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) was used to extract local features of IDRs, and long short-term memory (LSTM) was used to extract global features of IDRs. The CNN and LSTM were combined to obtain both the local features and global features of IDRs. Two models CNN-LSTM and LSTM-CNN were constructed inspired by SPOT-Disorder2. They employed the neural architecture search (NAS) model DARTS to capture the hidden features of protein sequences		Three types of features were combined into IDP-Fusion, including residue-profile features, evolutionary features, and structural features.

Clinical data from 4 different hospitals in China (4 different cities) about piatients with chronic B virus hepatitis. N = 1289 (patients from 4 different cities).  N_pos (fibrosis) = 815, N_neg (fibrosis) = 474 ;    N_pos (cirrhosis) = 290, N_neg (cirrhosis) = 999.   Data not used by previous authors.	Not applicable.

Test set Anhui:   N = 408 (independent patients dataset from Anhui city).  N_pos (fibrosis) = 254 // N_neg (fibrosis) = 154 ;    N_pos (cirrhosis) = 59 // N_neg (cirrhosis) = 359.     Test set Beijing:   N = 332 (independent patients dataset from Beijing city).  N_pos (fibrosis) = 179 // N_neg (fibrosis) = 153 ;    N_pos (cirrhosis) = 74 // N_neg (cirrhosis) = 258.        69.6% positives (fibrosis), 28.6% positives (cirrhosis) on training set.   62.3% positives (fibrosis), 14.5% positives (cirrhosis) on Anhui test set.  53.9% positives (fibrosis), 22.3% positives (cirrhosis) on Beijing test set.  			No.	FibroBox was compared to 3 other pre-existing predicting methods: TE (Transient Elastography), APRI (Aspartate transaminase-to-platelet ratio index), FIB-4 (fibrosis-4 index), the letter two being serum biomarkers. The LightGBM algorithm was coompared to Logistic regression and XGBoost. 	Confidence intervals at 95% for AUROC, statistical significance confirmed for the difference between FibroBox and each of TE, APRI, FIB-4 methods, both for fibrosis and for cyrrhosis predictions.	Precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy,  AUROC.  The latter was used for feature selection, and for comparison with other models. 	5-fold cross-validation during training-testing.  Two independent datasets were used as evaluation sets:  the Anhui cohort (n = 408), and the Beijing cohort (n=332).			The ML algorithms were implemented using Python 3.7.	The run time of FibroBox is mentioned in the Discussion to be only a few seconds.	No statement about ante-hoc interpretability of the model is made by the authors.   This LightGBM model looks to me complex enough to result rather black box.   Post-hoc analysis showed e.g. that the contribute of the Transient Elastography (TE) feature to the good predictability was very relevant, which is meaningful.  An explaination for an eventual joint effect of the 9 features was not adressed.	Classification.  Case A: positive and negative samples are non-significant fibrosis vs. significant fibrosis. Case B: positive and negative samples are non-cirrhosis vs. cirrhosis.			LightGBM (a gradient boosting framework using tree based learning algorithms) is stated in the Supplementary to have been the algorithm of choice.	No.	For character data field (like sex, pathogenesis), the LabelEncoder method in Python was used (categorical features encoded as a one-hot numeric array).	Starting from 24 features (clinical measurements commons to the 4 hospitals), 9 features were selected for training, by means of LASSO regression and filter methods (the latter being variance threshold, Pearson Correlation Coefficient, chi-square test and mutual information).	The LightGBM algorithm is stated in its documentation likely to be over-fitting if not used with the appropriate parameters. 	No.	The number of parameters was the standard for Python implementation of LightGBM.  Parameters were tuned to get good results by means of grid search, random search and the Python library Hyperopt.	"Yes.  The authors state that, ""to prevent overfitting, the index of colsample_bytree was set to 0.9"".    Other parameters tuning for over-fitting prevention is not mentioned.

Not applicable	SVM model with linear kernel was generated by a 10 fold repeated three-fold cross validation.  The RF model was generated by a 3-fold cross validation method repeated 100 times.			No.	The performances of the SVM and RF models were compared to the predicting performance of the albumin-to-creatinine ratio, a simple biomarker for DKD which has been widely used so far.	The authors state that the AUROC of the two classifiers (SVM and RF) differed significantly from albumin-to-creatinine ratio (likelihood ratio test: p-value < 0.05). However, for the RF AUROC (value = 1.0) no confidence intervals are reported, and the confidence intervals for SVM AUROC are not further specified.	AUROC.  Comparison of disease prediction scores.	Cross-validation.   Since the authors were unable to find a benchmarking study in the discovery of urine protein biomarkers, they evaluated the models with mRNA expression in the kidney.   The SVM and RF models consisting of 5 urine proteins were applied to 4 publicly available GEO datasets:  GSE99339, GSE47185, GSE30122, and GSE96804.  However, the predictions on such datasets were not statistically significant.			Data were analyzed using the publicly available RStudio (version 1.1.456) including R (version 3.6.0). 	Not reported.	No statement about ante-hoc interpretability of the models is made by the authors.   The RF and SVM are generally considered black box.   Post-hoc analysis resulted somewhat interpretable, since the 5 selected features correspond to 5 urinary proteins that are considered likely to be related to DKD.  However, their eventual joint effect remains not interpretable.	Binary classification (PPG or GPG).  The binary results of RF and SVM models were also transformed in disease prediction scores, which ranged from 0 to 1.			SVM and RF.	No.	Not reported.	The study focused on 412 proteins (of the 1296 identified proteins in each proteome) quantified in more than 80% of urine samples, with missing values filled by local least squares imputation.  From those 412 proteins, 5 proteins (ACP2, CTSA, GM2A, MUC1, and SPARCL1) were selected as significant by an AUC-based random forest method. 	The authors do not mention overfitting issues, although their multivariate AUROCs showed very high values.	No.	The authors do not mention parameters numbers different from standard.

Fecal samples were collected at baseline and twice each week. 6 weeks, 12 time points and 192 samples, for Ldlr-/- mice. 10 weeks, 20 time points and 480 samples, for ApoE-/- mice. 	Analytical standards for bile acids of interest were used with the same LC-MS/MS to ensure feature annotation. Data set stratification by genotypes and effect size calculation of each of the covariates within each mouse model to untangle the effect of genotype. 	1) Npos=96 samples for 8 Ldlr-/- mice exposed to intermittent hypoxia and hypercapnia (IHH). Nneg=96 samples for 8 Ldlr-/- mice exposed to air. Ntrain=192 for Ldlr-/- mice. Ntest=480 for ApoE-/- mice. 2) Npos=12 ApoE-/- mice exposed to intermittent hypoxia and hypercapnia (IHH). Nneg=12 ApoE-/- mice exposed to air. Ntrain=480 for ApoE-/- mice. Ntest=192 for Ldlr-/- mice. 			Yes. Supplementary information.	Not specified	Not specified	ROC curves, AUC score.	Cross-validation. Details not specified.			Yes, in Jupyter notebooks available on GitHub (https://github.com/knightlab-analyses/crossmodel_prediction).	Not specified	Transparent. The abundance of each feature, 16S sequence and metabolite, was used as the score to plot the ROC curve and compute the AUC score. Features that can single-handedly distinguish IHH-exposed samples on ROC plots were highlighted.	1) Binary predictions of IHH-exposed samples (positive) or air-exposed samples (negative) using total Ldlr-/- and ApoE-/- data as training and testing dataset, and vice versa. 2) For longitudinal binary predictions of IHH-exposed samples (positive) or air-exposed samples (negative), using Ldlr-/- or ApoE-/- data per time point as training and testing dataset, and vice versa. 			Random forest	Yes, in Jupyter notebooks available on GitHub (https://github.com/knightlab-analyses/crossmodel_prediction).	1) 16S rRNA raw amplicon sequencing data were processed and converted to sub-operational taxonomic unit (sOTU) abundance per sample (BIOM format) using the Deblur workflow. Taxonomies for sOTUs were assigned using the sklearn-based taxonomy classifier trained on the Greengenes 13_8 99% OTUs in QIIME 2. The sOTU table was rarefied to a depth of 2,000 sequences/sample to control for sequencing effort. A phylogeny was inferred using SATé-enabled phylogenetic placement, which was used to insert 16S Deblur sOTUs into Greengenes 13_8 at a 99% phylogeny. 2) Raw LC-MS/MS data sets were converted to m/z extensible markup language (mzXML) in centroid mode using MSConvert. All mzXML files were cropped with an m/z range of 75.00 to 1,000.00 Da. Feature extraction was performed in MZmine2 with a signal intensity threshold of 2.0e5 and minimum peak width of 0.3 s. The maximum allowed mass and retention time tolerances were 10 ppm and 10 s, respectively. A local minimum search algorithm with a minimum relative peak height of 1% was used for chromatographic deconvolution; the maximum peak width was set to 1 min. The detected peaks were aligned across all samples using the above-mentioned retention time and mass tolerances, producing the final feature table used in these analyses.  Molecular networking in GNPS was performed to putatively identify molecular features using MS/MS-based spectral library matches. 	1) First data layer.16S rRNA amplicon sequencing-derived abundances of microbial taxonomies. 2) Second data layer. Quantified LC-MS/MS peaks of detected metabolites following preprocessing. 	Cross-validation with all the samples from the same mouse appearing only in either training or validation data but not both, to avoid overoptimistic cross-validation accuracy scores because of the classifier learning idiosyncrasies of the individual itself rather than the treatment.

Profiles of 150 metabolites based on gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis of plasma samples from 70 postmenopausal women.	During GC/MS analysis tentative substances were not reported. All known artificial peaks were identified and removed before data mining. The metabolic feature columns, which had more than 40% of data missing, were eliminated.	Npos=23 patients with coronary microvascular disease (CMD). Nneg=47 participants, including 21 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and 26 healthy participants as control group.			Data is available from authors upon request.	1) One-way-ANOVA model and chi-squared analysis were fitted to test the statistical significance of clinical differences between different participant groups, followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. 2) Z-scores were calculated for each metabolite. An unpaired t-test was performed to identify metabolites that are different between each participant group. 	Not specified	Receiver operating curves (ROC), precision–recall (PR) curves, AUC score, F1 score	5-fold cross-validation			Data is available from authors upon request.

Recursive feature elimination with cross-validation (RFECV) from sklearn. Random forest was used as the estimator.	Data is available from authors upon request.	1) To allow comparison between samples, all data were normalized to the internal standard in each chromatogram. The raw data consisting of 175 metabolites measured across 70 participants was normalized using min/max scaling.  2) Data imputation with IterativeImputer of sklearn was utilized to handle missing data. The trained imputer was tested by removing the data of one metabolite feature column and imputing the data afterward. The performance of the imputer was measured for each of the metabolites using R^2 metric. Metabolite columns with R^2 < 0.3 and more than 5% of missing values across all patients were removed. 3) Data standardization to zero mean and unit variance for each metabolite feature column.  Data pre-processing step reduced the feature columns to 75 metabolites.  	Metabolic profiles of 45 metabolites following data preprocessing. Recursive feature elimination with cross-validation (RFECV), using random forest, reduced the number of features to 15 metabolites.

63516fedb9c880af1f305b7f	Yes. Supplementary Data.	ChIP-seq data, including uniformly processed peak calling results and peak width of promoter histone modifications from Roadmap and ENCODE projects for active (H3K4me3, H3K9ac, and H2A.Z) and repressive (H3K27me3) promoter modifications, and marks associated with enhancers (H3K4me1, H3K27ac, DNase I hypersensitivity sites).   Curated haploinsufficient (HIS) genes, positive (Npos) training observations, were collected from haploinsufficient training genes used in previous studies and genes with haploinsufficient score of 3 in ClinGen Dosage Sensitivity Map.  Curated haplosufficient (HS) genes, negative (Nneg) training observations, included genes deleted in two or more healthy people, based on CNVs detected in 2026 normal individuals.  All data were used in previous studies. 	Only genes with half or more of its length covered by any deletion were considered “deleted” (HS genes) in an individual.  The initial raw training may have included some false positive and false negative genes, as it contained results from automated literature mining that is known to give noisy output. To optimize the performance, the following pruning of the raw training set was performed:   1) Only protein-coding genes in autosomes were kept, as non-protein coding genes or genes on sex chromosomes may be under different mechanism of epigenomic regulation. 2) From the positive training set, genes with sufficient contradictory evidence were removed (ExAC pLI ≤ 0.1 and expected loss-of-function variants >1011). 3) From the negative training set, genes with sufficient contradictory evidence (pLI ≥ 0.2 and expected loss-of-function variants>10) were removed. 	Following pruning for the training set, Npos=287 curated haploinsufficient genes and Nneg=574 curated haplosufficient genes were considered for further analysis. 1) Ntrain=90%. Ntest=10%. 10-fold cross validation for training. 100 randomized runs. 2) Final training with all training data and estimation of probabilities. 			Yes. Supplementary Data.

Comparison of Episcore with pLI scores from ExAC, Shet values, and ranks of mouse heart expression level, using de novo likely-gene-disrupting (LGD) variants identified in: 1)  A previously published whole exome sequencing study DDD (Deciphering Developmental Disorders consortium) of 1365 trio families with congenital heart disease (CHD). 2) A second CHD WES cohort of 2645 parent−offspring trios from the Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium (PCGC). LGD variants include frameshift, nonsense and canonical splice site mutations. Episcore achieved better performance in prioritizing LGD de novo variants than the other methods. 	Permutation testing.

Yes. GitHub website. https://github.com/ShenLab/episcore	Not specified	Epigenomic features critical for the prediction were determined by calculating a Spearman correlation coefficient between each epigenomic feature and Episcore (random forest model) prediction.   One epigenomic feature corresponds to a data type per certain tissue/cell type. To examine which data types are more important, these Spearman correlation coefficients were plotted by data type.  To examine what tissue/cell types are more important, the averaged z-score for each tissue/cell type was calculated by: 1) Converting every Spearman correlation coefficient to a Z-score using mean and standard deviation specific to each data type and 2) Average Z-scores from various data types for each tissue/cell type.  This analysis indicated that epigenomic features in stem cells, brain tissues, and fetal tissues contribute more to Episcore prediction than other features. 	Binary predictions. All training genes used to train the best performing Random Forest model, and then estimate the probabilities of being positive (HIS) for all genes. The whole process was repeated 30 times and the arithmetic mean of the 30 sets of probabilities was used as result.			Random forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and SVM with LASSO feature selection.	Yes. GitHub website. https://github.com/ShenLab/episcore	For promoter features (H2A.Z, H3K27me3, H3K4me3, and H3K9ac), GappedPeaks were used to allow for broad domains of ChIP-seq signal. The assignment of a GapppedPeak to a gene followed these steps in order:  1) For each gene, only TSS of Ensembl canonical transcripts were used. 2) A GappedPeak was assigned to a TSS if the GappedPeak overlaps with the upstream 5 kb to downstream 1 kb region around the TSS. This definition of basal cis-regulatory region around promoter was according to GREAT tool. Assigning one GappedPeak to multiple TSS was allowed. 3) For TSS having more than 1 GappedPeak assigned, only the closest one was kept. 4) For genes with multiple TSS and hence multiple assigned GappedPeaks, only the longest GappedPeak was kept. After these four steps, if one gene had been associated with a GappedPeak, then the width of the peak was used as an epigenomic feature in the following machine learning models. If a gene had no associated GappedPeak, then the peak width is 0.  Coverage of H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K36me3, H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9me3, DNase I, and RNA-seq data was used as input for EpiTensor to infer interacting enhancers across distant genomic regions. This was done as balance between more input data types and more cell types included, as not every cell type has all these histone modifications characterized. 	The widths of called ChIP-seq peaks was used as promoter features. The counts of the interacting number of promoters and enhancers within pre-defined topologically associated domains (TADs) as enhancer features. Specifically, the results of peak width and number of interacting enhancers were consolidated into a matrix, with each row being a gene and each column representing a combination of a tissue and a data type, e.g. “H3K4me3 peak width in fetal heart”. One combination of a tissue and a data type was referred to as one epigenomic feature. This matrix was used as input for the machine learning models.

Random Forest classifier	Not available	For each ortholog group, its corresponding protein sequences were aligned with MUSCLE. The multiple sequence alignments were subsequently input in PhyML for the construction of phylogenetic trees using the Maximum Likelihood method. For amino acid and nucleotide-based tree construction in PhyML, the LG and HKY85 substitution matrices were used, respectively. Additionally, distance matrices were calculated for each tree, where the distance between two leaves corresponds to the sum of the branch lengths separating them.   Comparing two trees can be subject to artefacts and lead in some cases to spurious correlations if speciation events are not taken in account. For this reason, some of the co-evolution features also involve the Tree of Life (ToL) of the 34 genomes studied, which originated from submitting sequences of their respective 16S ribosomal RNA to similar treatment. Since distances in the ToL are computed from a nucleotide-based substitution matrix, the distances in the ToL matrix were rescaled for proper comparison with the protein-based distance matrices. 	For each protein pair, 7 coevolution features measuring the pairwise tree similarities have been defined.  Of these, 4 features are based on pairwise comparison of the distance matrices, as defined in the mirrortree approach, and whose metrics correspond to the linear correlation coefficient between the two matrices in consideration. Let A and B be the two MCP ortholog groups, mA and mB their respective matrices, tA and tB their trees. The parameter mirrorAB is the correlation between mA and mB, mirrorA is between mA and ToL, and mirrorB is between mB and ToL. The fourth descriptor, mirrorAB-ToL, involves an adaptation of the mirror tree, also known as tol-mirror, which measures the correlation between mA and mB after removing the background similarity inherent to speciation events in the ToL. The remaining 3 topological features are derived from the Icong index, defined as the probability that the Maximum Agreement Subtree (MAST) between two trees is arising by chance. Along the same idea, topological similarities were computed between tree A and ToL, tree B and ToL, and finally A and B (topA, topB, topAB).

Support Vector Machine with Linear kernel (Linear SVM)	No	The subjects’ brains were parcellated into 200 regions of interest (ROIs) using the Craddock atlas. Τhe RS-fMRI data were preprocessed to calculate FC measures between each pair of ROIs.  Friston-24 parameters were used to regress out the effects of head motion. To further reduce the effects of nuisance factors, signals from cerebrospinal fluid and white matter were also regressed out.  DARTEL toolbox was used to normalize the data and the resulting images were finally smoothed with a 6-mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel. The time series within each ROI were first band-pass filtered (0.01–0.08 Hz) and then averaged. For each participant, FC was calculated between each ROI using Pearson’s correlation coefficients, resulting in 19900-dimensional FC feature vectors for each subject. Patients with SCZ were labeled as 1, and HCs were labeled as -1. 	FC measurements between each pair of the 200 brain ROIs were used as classification features. Feature selection was performed for data dimension reduction using F-score for feature ranking. The 644 highest-ranked FC features were used to build the classifier.	Not specified	No	Linear SVM was implemented using the LIBSVM toolbox with the parameter C set to the default value of 1.	Yes. Linear SVM with C=1 and feature selection for data dimension reduction were selected to avoid overfitting.			6312169df3794236aa9879ed	33324147.0	PMC7725002	02/02/2026 19:46:52	Liu W, Zhang X, Qiao Y, Cai Y, Yin H, Zheng M, Zhu Y, Wang H.

Negative cases were all the proteins extracted from the genome of P. syringae pv. tomato strain DC3000, excluding proteins related to type III secretion system (T3SS) and hypothetical proteins. 4,062 proteins total. Npos = 283 protein sequences. Nneg = 3,779 protein sequences.  Non-redundant dataset of type III effectors. Removal of all homologous proteins (redundant), with sequence similarity greater than 60% from redundant dataset of type III effectors. 3,532 proteins total. Npos = 108 protein sequences. Nneg = 3,424 protein sequences. Only the first 100 N-terminal residues were used in both datasets. They were not previously used.	Homology present within positive cases. Possibility of overestimating negative cases due to the presence of uncharacterized T3SE proteins within them.	5-fold cross validation was performed. No information about the sizes of training and testing data sets.			Method and data are available to the public upon request.	EffectiveT3, T3SS prediction. Known classifiers for T3SS effector prediction. SVC with cross-validation but with different data encoding. 	Only the non-redundant data were used for the comparisons. Very low precision from EffectiveT3 (recall of 72.2% and precision of 17.9%) and T3SS prediction (recall of 83.3% and precision of 24%) due to being developed in less imbalanced and non-realistic training sets. For different data encoding methods, the recall and precision of effectors were 55.6% and 84.5%, respectively, which were over 5% lower than those of the proposed SSE-ACC method. 	Accuracy, Recall, Precision.	5-fold cross-validation. Independent dataset. A single predicted positive case of the independent dataset was validated through wet-lab experiments.

Calculated amino acid composition in terms of different secondary structures strand (E), helix (H) and coil (C), and solvent accessibility states (buried (B) and exposed (E)), with a method called SSE-ACC. The value of each dimension is calculated by  f_i^j=  (N_i^j)/L  where j = {H, E, C}, N_i^j is the frequency of amino acid i in secondary structure element j, and L is the length of the sequence. The value is calculated similarly for solvent accessibility states. 	100 features. The first 60 features are used to describe the frequency of each amino acid in each of the three possible secondary structure elements. The last 40 dimensions represent the frequency of each amino acid having each of the two possible solvent accessibility states.	Single input for SVM method. Optimization through grid search.

The R package LIMMA was used  to  select  significantly  differentially  expressed  genes (fold-change cutoff of >=2 and a p-value<0.01). To minimize the number of signature genes, the iterative BMA R package was applied, which accounts for model uncertainty and the dependency between signature genes.    The BMA step was applied to further reduce the number of signature genes from 43 to 3, and thus the costs associated with microarrays and time-consuming data analysis.

The dataset was randomly split into training (70%) and testing (30%) using the “createDataPartition” function part of the caret package in R (version 3.2.4 for iOS).

Model performance was compared based on the AUROC, kappa metrics, and Brier score. The AUROC of the RF model was highest at 0.74, significantly higher than LR (with a value of 0.57) but not significantly different from the ANN or MARS models.   LR had a very low kappa value (0.16), while RF had kappa values between 0.43 and 0.57, higher than ANN and MARS values of between 0.35 and 0.5 and, therefore, has the best prediction potential among the four models tested in this study based on the kappa metric.

Classification (binary prediction).  The continuous output of the LR, MARS, ANN was assigned as 'close to 1' or 'close to 0'.			Four approaches were compared: logistic regression (LR), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), artificial neural networks (ANN), random forest (RF). 	No	Not reported.	Exploratory data analyses resulted in removal of correlated predictors (±0.90).   In the end, 7 predictors were used (i.e. 7 types of environmental data -- air temperature, relative humidity, etc).  The “varImp” function contained in the caret package was used to determine the relative predictor importance for each model. Each model was run using 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 predictors. The most important variables were selected for the development of the final model.	Over-fitting in MARS and ANN was discussed and prevented.   In LR and RF, over-fitting should not have been an issue.  Possible underfitting was probabiy there for LR, which, with a kappa of 0.16, indicated a low degree of similarity, between observed and predicted, beyond random chance.	No.	For LR, MARS, RF, the authors do not mention parameters numbers different from standard.   For ANN, weights can be deduced to have been in the range of 100. Their number depended on the number of nodes in the hidden layer, which was optimized using 10-fold cross-validation and the AUROC curve for model assessment.	For MARS, the forward stepwise algorithm leads to an overfitted model which is then run through a backward stepwise algorithm where basis functions that contribute the least are removed (Friedman1991).   For RF,  to reduce overfitting, the tree was often pruned, resulting in a smaller tree with fewer splits. This was accomplished using the Gini index, which is a measure of variance across all classes—smaller values mean a more accurate prediction at that node.			65faa4f792c76639b82bab29	28696170.0		02/02/2026 19:46:52	Harteveld DOC, Grant MR, Pscheidt JW, Peever TL.

Patients in the registry were recruited from 38 hospitals since 2012, and their demographics, medications, comorbidities, extra-articular manifestations, disease activities, radiographic findings, and laboratory findings performed within 4 weeks prior to the patient’s visit were recorded with the date. The data from patients who were followed up annually were recorded on the KOBIO website (http://www.kobio.or.kr/kobio/), and these patients provided informed consent prior to registration. Ethical approval of the KOBIO-RA was obtained from the institutional review boards of all 38 participating institutions, including the Institutional Review Board of Inje University Seoul Paik Hospital (PAIK 2018-11-005).		 the training and test sets were divided in a 7:3 ratio, and the models were trained with the training set			no	The no information rate, which is the largest proportion of the observed classes, was used as a baseline to determine the overall distribution of the classification and to compare with those of the machine learning models	na	Bootstrapping (random sampling with replacement) was also performed to obtain a median value for the AUROC curve and to determine the accuracy for reducing measurement variances caused by small samples when dividing between the training and test sets.

Among the 64 variables, we selected variables that are frequently encountered in clinical practice for prescription of biologics and excluded variables that are not referenced when prescribing biologics. As a result, 15 variables known to be of clinical importance were preselected (i.e., sex, age, baseline DAS28-ESR, methotrexate dose, steroid dose, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive protein [CRP], rheumatoid factor [RF], anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody [ACPA], anti-nuclear antibody [ANA], and five comorbidities). Subsequently, 20 variables that were highly correlated with the drug response (remission) of each bDMARD were selected. After selecting variables based on data, we created a prediction model by training with a fixed set of 35 variables. Missing data for variables (Additional file: Table S3) were replaced with the median value for each variable. With a similar logic, binary variables such as comorbidities were coded as 1 if “yes” and 0 if “no” or “no test” because “no” was the most common value.	To avoid overfitting problems, the training and test sets were divided in a 7:3 ratio, and the models were trained with the training set; then, the prediction results were verified using the test set. For the training dataset, a 5-fold cross validation was performed to tune the hyperparameters determined as outside models (Additional file: Table S1 and Table S2). In this procedure, a grid search was conducted to evaluate all possible combinations of the hyperparameters. The grid search found optimal hyperparameters with the objective function of determining the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) in each model.

63516fedb9c880af1f305b77	no.	2 large sleep EEG data sets: the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) sleep lab data set (N = 2532; ages 18-80); and the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS, N =1974; ages 40-80)	They maintain strict separation of training and testing participants.	The MGH data set (N =2532) was partitioned into a healthy training set (N = 1343) used to train the model, and a testing set (N =1189) to evaluate model performance.  As validation, they used a subset of the SHHS data set where each participant underwent 2 study visits, referred as SHHS1 and SHHS2. The data set contains 987 adults for a total of 1974 nights of EEG recorded. They trained the model in 2 ways. First, they trained the model on 752 participants with paired EEGs (1504 EEGs) from both visits and tested on the held out 235 participants with paired EEGs (470 EEGs) in both visits. They trained the model on the 2365 EEGs from healthy participants in MGH data set. We then predicted BA on the 1974 paired EEGs in SHHS as the testing set.			no.	no.	The method reports statistical significant results.		The model is validated on a longitudinal cohort from a subset of the SHHS data set without neurological or cardiovascular disease.			no.		Transparent. The use of a parametric model, improves model interpretation by inspecting each EEG feature and comparing to the age norm for each feature explicitly. An example is provided in Figure 5 of the paper.	Regression.			Novel approach: They develop a machine learning model to predict BA based on 2 large sleep EEG data sets. The model is described in the paper.	yes, included in the paper.	EEG signals are notch-filtered at 60 Hz to reduce line noise, and bandpass filtered from 0.5 Hz to 20 Hz to reduce myogenic artifacts. For 30s-epochs, those with absolute amplitude larger than 500 m V are removed to minimize movement artifacts. Epochs containing flat EEG for more than 2 seconds are also removed. We also exclude EEGs contaminated by electrocardiogram, indicated by 1 Hz harmonic in the EEG spectrogram. To reduce interparticipant variance, the amplitude of each EEG channel is normalized to have zero median and unit interquartile range across the whole night. The total amount of data removed by these preprocessing procedures is 7% in the MGH data set and 9% in the SHHS data set.	They extract 102 features from each 30-second epoch covering both time and frequency domains. For each EEG recording, they average the features in each of the 5 sleep stages overtime, yielding 102 x 5 = 510 features per EEG.	One strength of the study is the use of large data sets. The number of EEGs involved in this study is large among relevant “BA” studies. The large size of the data sets helps to ensure the statistical power as well and to minimize selection bias. A large training set helps ensure that the trained model does not overfit to a particular data set, improving the ability togeneralize when applied beyond the training set. A large testing set allows accurate statistical measurement of how accurately the model performs.	no.	one. To determine the optimal hyperparameter, they randomly select 300 EEGs from the training set to serve as internal validation data.				6312169df3794236aa987a03	30448611.0	PMC6478501	02/02/2026 19:46:52	Sun H, Paixao L, Oliva JT, Goparaju B, Carvalho DZ, van Leeuwen KG, Akeju O, Thomas RJ, Cash SS, Bianchi MT, Westover MB.

Feature dimensionality was reduced by the mRMR algorithm42 using R package mRMRe. mRMR has been shown to be a robust feature selection algorithm in various tasks43,44,45. The mRMR algorithm was applied to all image features with regard to the class label of sample (i.e., TFE3-RCC or ccRCC) to select an informative and non-redundant set of features.
