  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in our study is the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Artificial Neural Network (ANN). This is a well-established type of feed-forward ANN architecture that has been widely used for various classification and pattern recognition tasks.\n\nThe MLP ANN employed in our research is not a new algorithm. It has been extensively studied and applied in numerous fields, including bioinformatics and microbial identification. The back-propagation algorithm, which is used for training the MLP ANN, is also a standard and well-understood method in the machine-learning community.\n\nThe reason this specific algorithm was chosen for our study is its proven effectiveness in handling complex, non-linear relationships in data, which is particularly relevant for biological datasets. The MLP ANN's ability to learn from examples and adapt through weighted connections makes it well-suited for identifying key features in biochemical and genetic data, thereby improving the accuracy of microbial identification.\n\nGiven the focus of our research on microbial identification and the application of computational methods to biological data, it is appropriate to publish these findings in a microbiology journal rather than a machine-learning journal. The primary contribution of our work lies in the application of established machine-learning techniques to solve specific problems in microbiology, rather than the development of new algorithms.",
  "optimization/meta": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several key steps. Biochemical test results and sequence IDs were used as inputs for the artificial neural network (ANN). The ANN utilized a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture with a back-propagation algorithm. The inputs represented either biochemical test results or sequence IDs, and the network had two hidden nodes in the hidden layer for mathematical feature detection. A single output node was used to represent the species class, with a class assignment of 1 indicating E. sakazakii strains and 2 representing all other strains.\n\nTo ensure the robustness and generality of the models, a random sample cross-validation approach was employed. This involved running 100 random training/test/validation sub-models and evaluating them. This method guaranteed that all samples were treated as blind data multiple times, which helped in calculating confidence intervals for each sample and ensured model generality.\n\nAdditionally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the importance ratio of each input. This process involved removing each input singularly from the model and measuring the error of predictions. The sensitivity ratio was then calculated based on the performance with and without the given input. A sensitivity ratio greater than one indicated that the removal of the input was detrimental to the model's predictive performance, highlighting its importance.\n\nThe phenotypic data, when used as inputs, resulted in a predictive performance of 99.3% for blind (validation) data, with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 97.6%. This high accuracy underscores the effectiveness of the data encoding and preprocessing methods used in the study.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In the optimization process, the number of input parameters, p, used in the model varied depending on the type of data being analyzed. For phenotypic data, the inputs represented biochemical test results. For genotypic data, the inputs were sequence IDs derived from 16S rDNA sequences.\n\nThe selection of p was not explicitly stated as a fixed number. Instead, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the importance of each input. This involved removing each input singularly from the model and measuring the error of predictions. The sensitivity ratio was then calculated based on the performance with and without the given input. Inputs with a sensitivity ratio greater than one were considered important, as their removal negatively affected the model's predictive performance. This approach ensured that only the most relevant inputs were retained, reducing model dimensionality and complexity.\n\nTwo hidden nodes were used in the hidden layer for mathematical feature detection, and a single output node was used to represent the species class. The output node assigned a class of 1 to E. sakazakii strains and a class of 2 to all other strains. This binary classification approach simplified the model's output, making it easier to interpret the results.",
  "optimization/features": "The input features for the models developed in this study included biochemical test results and sequence ID data. The specific number of features used as input is not explicitly stated, but it is implied that a comprehensive set of biochemical tests and sequence data were utilized.\n\nFeature selection was indeed performed to identify the most relevant inputs for the models. This process involved sensitivity analysis, where each input was removed singularly from the model, and the error of predictions was measured. The sensitivity ratio was then calculated based on the performance with and without the given input. This approach helped to determine the importance of each input, with a sensitivity ratio greater than one indicating an input whose removal was detrimental to the model's predictive performance.\n\nThe feature selection process was conducted using a random sample cross-validation approach, where 100 random training/test/validation sub-models were run and evaluated. This method ensured that all samples were treated as blind data multiple times, guaranteeing model generality and enabling confidence intervals to be calculated for each sample. Therefore, the feature selection was performed using the training set only, ensuring that the validation and test sets remained unbiased.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study utilized a multi-layer perceptron artificial neural network (MLP ANN) with a back-propagation algorithm. The network architecture included two hidden nodes in the hidden layer for mathematical feature detection and a single output node to represent species class. The class assignment was binary, with 1 indicating E. sakazakii strains and 2 representing all other strains.\n\nTo address the potential issue of over-fitting, given that the number of parameters in the ANN could be large relative to the number of training points, a robust cross-validation approach was implemented. Specifically, 100 random training/test/validation sub-models were run and evaluated. This repeated random sampling ensured that all samples were treated as blind data multiple times, promoting model generality and enabling the calculation of confidence intervals for each sample. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the importance ratio of each input. This involved removing each input singularly from the model and measuring the error of predictions. A sensitivity ratio greater than one indicated that the removal of a given input was detrimental to the model's predictive performance, thereby highlighting its importance.\n\nTo rule out under-fitting, the model's predictive performance was thoroughly evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The high predictive performance achieved, particularly with phenotypic data resulting in 99.3% correct discrimination between E. sakazakii and closely related species, demonstrated the model's capability to generalize well to unseen data. Furthermore, the use of both phenotypic and genotypic data as inputs ensured that the model captured a comprehensive range of features, reducing the risk of under-fitting. The successful classification of strains, including those that were \u03b1-glucosidase positive, further validated the model's robustness and its ability to handle complex datasets effectively.",
  "optimization/regularization": "A multi-layer perceptron artificial neural network was employed, utilizing the back-propagation algorithm for training.

Each sample was treated as blind data multiple times, which helped in calculating confidence intervals for each sample. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the importance of each input. This process involved removing each input singularly from the model and measuring the prediction error. The sensitivity ratio was then calculated based on the model's performance with and without the given input. A sensitivity ratio greater than one indicated that the removal of that input was detrimental to the model's predictive performance, highlighting its importance. This method helped in identifying key biochemical tests and important areas of the DNA sequence for accurate species discrimination.",

Specifically, we employed a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with the back-propagation algorithm. The network architecture included two hidden nodes for mathematical feature detection and a single output node to represent species class.

However, the methods and results described offer a comprehensive overview of the configurations and optimization strategies employed. For specific model files and detailed optimization parameters, further inquiry or access to supplementary materials may be necessary.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in this study is not a blackbox. It is designed to provide insights into the key features that contribute to the classification of samples. The use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), specifically the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with the back-propagation algorithm, allows for the identification of important inputs that influence the model's predictions.\n\nOne of the key aspects of the model's transparency is the sensitivity analysis conducted. This process involves removing each input singularly from the model and measuring the error of predictions. The sensitivity ratio is then calculated based on the performance with and without the given input. A sensitivity ratio greater than one indicates that the removal of that input is detrimental to the model's predictive performance, highlighting its importance.\n\nFor example, in the context of biochemical tests, the model identified specific tests that are crucial for differentiating between strains. These tests are summarized in a table, showing the percent positive strains for E. sakazakii as well as other \u03b1-glucosidase positive and negative Enterobacteriaceae. This information provides clear examples of how certain biochemical characteristics are key in the classification process.\n\nSimilarly, the analysis of 16S rDNA sequence data identified three main regions of the sequence that are critical for discriminating between different species. These regions are highlighted in a figure, and a table lists the top 20 nucleotides with the greatest relative importance. This detailed information allows for a transparent understanding of which parts of the sequence are most influential in the model's decisions.\n\nAdditionally, the population distribution of samples from the biochemical test data is visualized, showing distinct clusters that support the interpretation of the partial 16S rDNA clustering. This visualization helps in understanding how the model classifies samples and the variation present within and across species.\n\nOverall, the model's design and the analyses conducted ensure that it is not a blackbox. The transparency is achieved through detailed sensitivity analyses, clear visualizations, and summaries of key inputs, providing a comprehensive understanding of the factors driving the model's predictions.",

For phenotypic data, the model achieved a predictive performance of 99.3% on blind (validation) data, with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 97.6%. When using 16S rDNA sequence data, the model's predictive performance was 98.7%, with a sensitivity of 92.9% and specificity of 100%. The use of biochemical test data as inputs further improved the model's accuracy, correctly predicting 100% of the strains into their respective classes.\n\nThe model's output provides a clear classification of samples, with a prediction of one indicating a sample is E. sakazakii and a prediction of two indicating another species. This classification helps in reducing the risk of false positive and negative results, which is crucial for accurate pathogen identification. The model's ability to handle complex data and provide reliable classifications makes it a valuable tool for rapid and accurate identification of bacterial strains.",

This method helped in calculating confidence intervals for each sample, providing a more reliable assessment of model generality. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted to determine the importance of each input by measuring the error of predictions when inputs were removed. This process helped in identifying the most relevant biochemical tests and genetic sequences for accurate species classification.\n\nThe reported metrics are representative of the standards in the literature, focusing on accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity to ensure comprehensive evaluation.
