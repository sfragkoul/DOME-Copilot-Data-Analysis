  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from a group of 27 ambulatory female MS patients who met specific inclusion criteria. These patients were referred to fellowship-trained neurourologists and screened for the study. The inclusion criteria involved adult females aged 18 or older with clinically stable MS for at least 6 months and symptomatic neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) for at least 3 months. Exclusions included men, those with anatomical bladder outlet obstruction, severe debilitating MS, history of seizures, pregnancy, contraindications to MRI, history of augmentation cystoplasty, and other neurological disorders besides MS.\n\nThe patients were divided into two groups based on their cystometric studies during their initial urodynamic study visit. The first group consisted of patients without voiding dysfunction (V), who voided spontaneously and had a post-void residual (PVR) volume of less than 40% of their bladder capacity. This group included 14 patients. The second group consisted of patients with voiding dysfunction (VD), who performed self-catheterization or had a PVR volume of 40% or more of the bladder capacity. This group included 13 patients.\n\nAll patients completed a detailed history, physical examination, and validated questionnaires, including the Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI-6), Incontinence Impact Questionnaire 7 (IIQ-7), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), and MRI Safety Screening Questionnaire. Additionally, all patients underwent concurrent functional MRI/urodynamics testing.\n\nThe dataset utilized in this study has not been previously used in other papers or by the community. The focus was on investigating the validity of using machine learning to classify MS patients into voiders or VD groups, utilizing functional connectivity (FC) and structural connectivity (SC) as predictors.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into two main splits: a training set and a test set. Each split contained 50% of the entire dataset. This means that half of the data points were used for training the machine learning algorithms, and the other half were used for testing their performance. Additionally, within the training set, a ten-fold repeated cross-validation with five repeats was employed. This involved further splitting the training data into ten subsets, where nine subsets were used for training and one subset was used for validation in each fold. This process was repeated five times to ensure robustness in the model's performance evaluation.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset was divided into two independent sets: a training set and a test set. Each set comprised 50% of the entire dataset. To ensure the robustness and reliability of the machine learning algorithms, ten-fold repeated cross-validation with five repeats was employed during the training phase. This method involved splitting the training data into ten subsets, training the model on nine of these subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This process was repeated ten times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. The entire cross-validation procedure was repeated five times to further enhance the stability of the results.\n\nThe use of cross-validation helped to mitigate overfitting and ensured that the model generalized well to unseen data. By splitting the data into training and test sets and using cross-validation, the independence of the datasets was maintained, allowing for an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance. This approach is consistent with best practices in machine learning, ensuring that the results are reliable and reproducible.\n\nThe distribution of the data in this study is comparable to previously published machine learning datasets in similar domains. The focus on functional connectivity (FC) and structural connectivity (SC) as predictor variables is novel, particularly in the context of classifying voiding dysfunction in multiple sclerosis patients. The use of advanced neuroimaging techniques and machine learning algorithms provides a comprehensive approach to understanding the complex relationships within the data. This methodology sets a precedent for future studies aiming to leverage brain connectivity information for clinical predictions.",
  "dataset/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithms employed in this study were not new, but rather well-established methods chosen for their varying capabilities in handling different types of data relationships. The algorithms used were random forests (RF), neural networks (NN), generalized linear model (GLM), and partial least squares (PLS). These algorithms were selected because they are based on different principal algorithms, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of their performance in classifying subjects based on functional connectivity (FC) and structural connectivity (SC) values.\n\nThe choice of algorithms was driven by the need to explore both linear and non-linear relationships within the data. For instance, GLM, which is based on linear regression, was included to assess the performance of a linear model. In contrast, RF and PLS were chosen for their ability to handle complex, non-linear relationships, which are often present in brain connectivity data.\n\nThe study did not introduce a new machine-learning algorithm. Instead, it focused on applying existing algorithms to a novel problem: classifying voiding dysfunction (VD) in female multiple sclerosis (MS) patients using brain connectivity data. The algorithms were chosen for their robustness and widespread use in similar classification tasks, ensuring that the results were reliable and comparable to other studies in the field.\n\nThe decision to use these specific algorithms was also influenced by their ability to provide insights into the relative importance of different predictors. For example, the predictor weights from the best-performing algorithm (random forest) were used to assess the importance of FC and SC information in predicting VD. This approach allowed for a detailed analysis of which brain connectivity measures were most influential in the classification task.\n\nIn summary, the machine-learning algorithms used in this study were well-established methods chosen for their ability to handle different types of data relationships and provide valuable insights into the predictors of VD in MS patients. The focus was on applying these algorithms to a new and important clinical problem, rather than developing a new algorithm.",
  "optimization/meta": "The study did not employ a meta-predictor approach. Instead, it utilized individual machine learning algorithms to predict voiding dysfunction (VD) in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. The algorithms used were random forests (RF), neural networks (NNET), generalized linear model (GLM), and partial least squares (PLS). These algorithms were applied separately to different types of input data: functional connectivity (FC) only, structural connectivity (SC) only, and a combination of both.\n\nEach algorithm was trained and evaluated independently using ten-fold repeated cross-validation with five repeats. The performance of these algorithms was assessed based on the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC). The best-performing algorithm was determined by the highest AUC value.\n\nThe study did not combine the outputs of these algorithms into a meta-predictor. Instead, it focused on identifying the most effective individual algorithm for predicting VD in MS patients. The relative importance of FC and SC values as predictors was also evaluated using the best-performing algorithm.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the machine-learning algorithms, the data encoding and preprocessing involved several key steps. Functional connectivity (FC) values were quantified for specific brain regions, reflecting the strength of connections in the voiding initiation network. Structural connectivity (SC) was assessed using fractional anisotropy (FA) values derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) aligned to the ICBM-DTI81 atlas, which consists of 50 white matter tracts. FA values served as a metric for white matter tract integrity and SC.\n\nThe dataset was split into a training set (50%) and a test set (50%). To ensure robust model training, ten-fold repeated cross-validation with five repeats was employed. This approach helped in evaluating the performance of the machine-learning algorithms and mitigating overfitting.\n\nFour different machine-learning algorithms were utilized: random forests (RF), neural networks (NN), generalized linear model (GLM), and partial least squares (PLS). Each algorithm was trained using FC values, SC values, or a combination of both as predictor variables. The goal was to classify subjects into either the voiders (V) group or the voiding dysfunction (VD) group.\n\nThe performance of the algorithms was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC). The algorithm with the highest AUC was identified as the best-performing model. Predictor weights, ranging from 0 to 100, were used to assess the relative importance of FC or SC information in predicting group classification. This encoding and preprocessing pipeline ensured that the machine-learning models could effectively capture the complex relationships in the data, leading to accurate predictions of voiding dysfunction in multiple sclerosis patients.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the input parameters consisted of functional connectivity (FC) values and structural connectivity (SC) values, specifically fractional anisotropy (FA) values. These values were derived from various brain regions and white matter tracts, respectively.\n\nThe FC values were quantified for brain regions known to be part of the voiding initiation network (VIN), including the dorsal vagal motor nuclei, pontine storage and micturition center, peri-aqueductal grey, ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra, red nuclei, thalamus, cingulate, insula, and cortical regions in the frontal, parietal, and mesial temporal lobes.\n\nFor SC, FA values were obtained from 50 white matter tracts as defined by the ICBM-DTI81 atlas. These tracts were used to assess white matter integrity and structural connectivity.\n\nThe selection of these parameters was based on their relevance to the neural mechanisms underlying voiding dysfunction (VD) in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. The FC and FA values were chosen because they provide insights into the functional and structural aspects of brain connectivity, which are crucial for understanding and predicting VD.\n\nThe specific brain regions and white matter tracts were identified through previous research and their known involvement in the neural control of voiding. The use of these parameters allowed us to capture the complex interplay between grey and white matter in MS patients, thereby enhancing the predictive power of our machine learning models.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized both functional connectivity (FC) and structural connectivity (SC) values as input features for our machine learning algorithms. Specifically, FC values were quantified for various brain regions within the voiding initiation network (VIN), while SC values were represented by fractional anisotropy (FA) values obtained from 50 white matter tracts.\n\nFeature selection was inherently performed through the machine learning process itself. The algorithms, particularly the best-performing ones like random forests (RF) and partial least squares (PLS), assigned predictor weights to the FC and SC values. These weights served as a measure to assess the relative importance of each feature in predicting whether a patient belonged to the voiding (V) or voiding dysfunction (VD) group.\n\nThe feature selection process was conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the test set remained unbiased and that the model's performance could be accurately evaluated. This approach allowed us to identify the most significant brain regions and white matter tracts contributing to the classification of VD in multiple sclerosis patients.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The study employed machine learning algorithms to classify patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) into those who void spontaneously and those with voiding dysfunction (VD). Four different machine learning algorithms were used: random forests (RF), neural networks (NN), generalized linear model (GLM), and partial least squares (PLS). The dataset was split into a training set (50%) and a test set (50%), and ten-fold repeated cross-validation with five repeats was utilized to train the algorithms. This approach helps in ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data and mitigates the risk of overfitting.\n\nThe number of parameters in the models, particularly in RF and NN, can be quite large compared to the number of training points. To rule out overfitting, cross-validation was employed, which provides a robust estimate of model performance on unseen data. Additionally, the use of multiple algorithms allowed for comparison, ensuring that the best-performing model was selected based on its ability to generalize rather than memorize the training data.\n\nUnderfitting was addressed by selecting algorithms that could capture complex, non-linear relationships in the data. The GLM, which is based on linear regression, performed the worst, indicating that a linear model was insufficient for this task. In contrast, RF and PLS, which are capable of handling non-linear relationships, performed better, suggesting that these models were better suited to the complexity of the data.\n\nThe area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used as the primary metric to evaluate the performance of the algorithms. The algorithm with the highest AUC was considered the best-performing, ensuring that the model not only had high accuracy but also a good balance between sensitivity and specificity. This rigorous evaluation process helped in selecting a model that was neither overfitted nor underfitted to the data.",
  "optimization/regularization": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a black box. It utilizes machine learning algorithms that provide insights into the relative importance of different predictors. Specifically, the random forest (RF) algorithm, which was identified as one of the best-performing algorithms, offers a measure of predictor importance. This importance is quantified as predictor weights ranging from 0 to 100, indicating the contribution of each feature in classifying subjects into the voiding (V) or voiding dysfunction (VD) groups.\n\nFor instance, when both functional connectivity (FC) and structural connectivity (SC) values were used as predictors, the 10 most important values for classification were all FC values. This suggests that FC plays a more significant role in predicting VD in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients compared to SC. Additionally, among the white matter tracts, the right superior longitudinal fasciculus was identified as the most important, although it was ranked 16th in relative importance.\n\nThe use of predictor weights allows for a transparent interpretation of the model's decisions. It highlights which brain connectivity features are most influential in distinguishing between patients who void spontaneously and those with VD. This transparency is crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms and for potential clinical applications, such as early symptom detection and personalized treatment strategies.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in this study is a classification model. It is designed to categorize patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) into two groups: those who void spontaneously and those who experience voiding dysfunction (VD). The model utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze brain connectivity data, specifically functional connectivity (FC) and structural connectivity (SC), to make these classifications. The performance of the model is evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC), which is a common metric for assessing the effectiveness of classification models. The best-performing algorithms, such as random forests (RF) and partial least squares (PLS), achieved high AUC values, indicating strong classification capabilities.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method employed in this study involved a robust approach to ensure the reliability and generalizability of the machine learning algorithms used. The dataset was split into a training set and a test set, each comprising 50% of the data. To further validate the performance of the algorithms, ten-fold repeated cross-validation with five repeats was utilized. This technique helps in assessing the model's performance by training and testing it on different subsets of the data, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting and providing a more accurate estimate of the model's generalization capability.\n\nThe performance of the machine learning algorithms was primarily evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC). The algorithm that achieved the highest AUC was identified as the best-performing model. This metric is crucial as it provides a comprehensive measure of the model's ability to distinguish between the two groups: patients who void spontaneously (V) and those with voiding dysfunction (VD).\n\nAdditionally, the predictor weights of the best-performing algorithm were analyzed to assess the relative importance of functional connectivity (FC) and structural connectivity (SC) information in predicting group membership. These weights, ranging from 0 to 100, served as a measure to understand which type of brain connectivity information was more influential in the classification task. This evaluation method not only validated the effectiveness of the machine learning approach but also provided insights into the underlying neural mechanisms associated with voiding dysfunction in multiple sclerosis patients.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed several performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of our machine learning algorithms in predicting voiding dysfunction (VD) in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. The primary metric used was the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC). The AUC provides a comprehensive measure of the model's ability to distinguish between patients who void spontaneously and those with VD. This metric is widely recognized and used in the literature for evaluating classification models, particularly in medical research.\n\nWe reported AUC values for four different machine learning algorithms: random forests (RF), neural networks (NN), generalized linear model (GLM), and partial least squares (PLS). These algorithms were evaluated using three types of inputs: functional connectivity (FC) values only, structural connectivity (SC) values only, and a combination of both FC and SC values. This approach allowed us to assess the performance of each algorithm under different conditions and to determine which type of connectivity information was most predictive.\n\nThe AUC values for each algorithm and input type were compared to identify the best-performing models. For instance, when using FC values as predictors, the AUC values ranged from 0.53 to 0.89, with PLS achieving the highest performance. Similarly, when using SC values, the AUC values ranged from 0.51 to 0.93, with RF performing the best. When combining both FC and SC values, the AUC values ranged from 0.79 to 0.96, with RF again showing the highest performance. These results highlight the importance of considering both types of connectivity information for accurate prediction.\n\nIn addition to AUC, we also assessed the relative importance of predictors using the weights assigned by the best-performing algorithms. This provided insights into which brain regions or white matter tracts were most critical for distinguishing between the two patient groups. For example, in the case of FC values, the left frontal brain regions and left cingulate were identified as the most significant predictors. For SC values, the most important white matter tracts included the right superior longitudinal fasciculus and the left anterior corona radiata.\n\nOverall, the set of performance metrics used in our study is representative of standard practices in the field. The AUC is a well-established metric for evaluating classification models, and the inclusion of predictor weights allows for a deeper understanding of the underlying factors contributing to the model's predictions. This comprehensive evaluation approach ensures that our findings are robust and comparable to other studies in the literature.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we did not perform a direct comparison to publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. Instead, our focus was on evaluating the performance of different machine learning algorithms in the context of our specific dataset and research question.\n\nWe did, however, compare the performance of several machine learning algorithms, including random forests (RF), neural networks (NN), generalized linear model (GLM), and partial least squares (PLS). These algorithms were chosen because they represent different approaches to modeling data, ranging from linear to complex non-linear relationships.\n\nThe comparison among these algorithms was conducted using ten-fold repeated cross-validation with five repeats. This rigorous validation process helped us to identify the best-performing algorithms for our task of classifying patients into voiders (V) and those with voiding dysfunction (VD).\n\nThe results showed that RF and PLS consistently performed better than GLM across different types of inputs (functional connectivity (FC) only, structural connectivity (SC) only, and combined). This indicates that more complex, non-linear algorithms are better suited for capturing the intricate relationships in our data.\n\nAdditionally, we assessed the relative importance of FC and SC information using the predictor weights from the best-performing algorithm. This provided insights into which type of brain connectivity information is more critical for predicting voiding dysfunction in multiple sclerosis patients.\n\nIn summary, while we did not compare our methods to publicly available benchmarks, we conducted a thorough comparison among different machine learning algorithms to determine the most effective approach for our specific research question.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "Evaluation Confidence\n\nThe study employed ten-fold repeated cross-validation with five repeats to train the machine learning algorithms, ensuring robust evaluation. The performance of the algorithms was primarily assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The AUC values for different algorithms were reported, allowing for a clear comparison of their performance.\n\nStatistical significance was considered in the analysis of patient demographics, with p-values from unpaired t-tests and chi-square tests provided for various criteria. Significant differences were observed in specific criteria used to define voiding dysfunction (VD), such as self-catheterization and the percentage of post-void residual volume to bladder capacity (%PVR/BC). These statistical tests help to validate the differences between the groups and support the reliability of the findings.\n\nThe best-performing algorithms, random forests (RF) and partial least squares (PLS), were identified based on their highest AUC values. The predictor weights from these algorithms were used to assess the relative importance of functional connectivity (FC) and structural connectivity (SC) in predicting VD. This approach provides a quantitative measure of the importance of different brain regions and white matter tracts in the classification task.\n\nThe study also highlighted the need for complex non-linear algorithms, as indicated by the poor performance of the generalized linear model (GLM), which is based on linear regression. This suggests that the relationships in the data are non-linear, and more sophisticated methods are required to capture these complexities.\n\nOverall, the evaluation methods used in the study provide a strong foundation for confidence in the results. The use of cross-validation, statistical tests, and the identification of the best-performing algorithms contribute to the reliability and validity of the findings. The study's approach to evaluating the importance of different predictors further enhances the confidence in the conclusions drawn.",
