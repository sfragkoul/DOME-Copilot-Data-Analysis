  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in our study consists of 238 resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) scans. These scans were collected from typically developing participants ranging in age from 7 to 30 years. The data was acquired using a 3 Tesla (3 T) scanner under continuous rest conditions. Each scan lasted approximately 5 minutes, during which blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) time courses were generated for 160 regions of interest (ROIs) derived from meta-analyses of task-related fMRI studies. These ROIs cover a significant portion of the brain. All possible interregional temporal correlations, or functional connections, were computed for each individual, resulting in 12,720 functional connections per scan. The dataset was used to develop a functional connectivity multivariate pattern analysis (fcMVPA) approach, which combines the sensitivity of multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) with the robust and easy data acquisition of fcMRI. This approach allowed us to predict the functional maturity level of individual brains based on the rs-fcMRI data. The dataset has not been used in previous papers by the community, as it was specifically collected for this study.",
  "dataset/splits": "The study utilized multiple datasets to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the findings. The primary dataset consisted of 238 resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) scans from typically developing participants aged between 7 and 30 years. These scans were collected at 3 Tesla (3 T) during continuous rest periods.\n\nIn addition to the primary dataset, two other large-scale developmental functional connectivity datasets were used for independent replication. The second dataset included 195 fcMRI scans from participants aged 7 to 31 years, collected at 1.5 Tesla (1.5 T). These scans were extracted from blocked fMRI designs where rest periods were identified. The third dataset comprised 186 event-related fMRI scans from participants aged 6 to 35 years. To make these scans more similar to resting-state data, task effects were regressed out.\n\nThe primary dataset was used to develop the functional connectivity multivariate pattern analysis (fcMVPA) approach. For binary classification, 61 scans from children aged 7 to 11 years (mean age 9.4) and 61 scans from adults aged 24 to 30 years (mean age 26.2) were used. These groups were matched for brain volume and in-scanner movement, achieving 91% accuracy, 90% sensitivity, and 92% specificity.\n\nFor the replication datasets, the same analyses were conducted. Dataset 2 achieved an accuracy of 92% for binary classification, while dataset 3 achieved 93%. The functional brain maturity prediction results also replicated, with dataset 2 showing an r\u00b2 value of 0.519 and dataset 3 showing an r\u00b2 value of 0.557.\n\nAfter generating functional connectivity maturation index (fcMI) values for each dataset, 613 scans from participants aged 6 to 30 years were combined into a single, \"mixed-type\" functional connectivity maturation curve. This curve exhibited similar properties to the pure 3-T rs-fcMRI maturation curve. Six participants older than 30 years from datasets 2 and 3 were excluded to maintain consistency across datasets.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "To ensure the robustness and generalizability of our findings, we employed a rigorous approach to dataset redundancy and independence. Our primary dataset consisted of 238 resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) scans from typically developing participants aged 7 to 30 years. These scans were acquired under continuous rest conditions at 3 Tesla.\n\nTo avoid circularity bias and ensure that our training and test sets were independent, we used a leave-one-out cross-validation methodology. This method involves training the model on all but one sample and then testing it on the left-out sample. This process is repeated such that each sample is used as a test set exactly once. This approach helps to ensure that the model's performance is not overly optimistic and that it generalizes well to new, unseen data.\n\nIn addition to our primary dataset, we conducted independent replication analyses on two other large-scale developmental functional connectivity datasets. These datasets had somewhat different characteristics but were used to validate our findings. Data set 2 consisted of 195 fcMRI scans from participants aged 7 to 31 years, acquired at 1.5 Tesla, with rest periods extracted from blocked fMRI designs. Data set 3 included 186 event-related fMRI scans from participants aged 6 to 35 years, which were made more similar to resting state by regressing out task effects.\n\nThe distribution of our datasets compares favorably to previously published machine learning datasets in the field of neuroimaging. Our datasets are larger and more diverse, encompassing a broader age range and different types of functional connectivity data. This diversity helps to ensure that our findings are robust and generalizable across different populations and imaging conditions.\n\nTo enforce the independence of training and test sets, we carefully curated our datasets to ensure that there was no overlap between participants in the training and test sets. This was achieved by using distinct cohorts for each dataset and by ensuring that the leave-one-out cross-validation process was applied rigorously. Additionally, we excluded six participants older than 30 years from the fits for consistency across datasets, further ensuring the independence and comparability of our results.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in our study is Support Vector Machines (SVMs). SVMs are a well-established class of algorithms known for their effectiveness in classification and regression tasks, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional data. They are resilient to overfitting and allow for the extraction of feature weights, which is crucial for understanding the contributions of different functional connections to brain maturity prediction.\n\nThe specific implementation of SVMs used in our work is not new; it is a standard approach in the field of machine learning. The choice of SVMs was driven by their robustness and the ability to handle the complex patterns generated by functional connectivity data. The focus of our publication is on the application of these algorithms to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to predict brain maturity, rather than the development of a new machine-learning algorithm.\n\nGiven that the primary contribution of our study is in the domain of neuroscience and developmental biology, the publication is appropriately placed in a scientific journal that focuses on these areas. The machine-learning techniques used are well-documented and widely accepted, so there was no need to publish them in a machine-learning journal. Instead, the innovation lies in the application of these techniques to a novel dataset and the insights gained into brain development.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. It is not a meta-predictor. The approach used is functional connectivity multivariate pattern analysis (fcMVPA), which combines the sensitivity of multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) with the robust and easy data acquisition of functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI). The specific machine-learning method employed is support vector machines (SVMs), which are used for both classification and regression tasks. The SVM regression (SVR) is used to predict brain age as an estimate of functional maturity level. The training data for the SVR consists of chronological age, which is easily obtained and free of measurement error. The model was trained using 238 rs-fcMRI scans from typically developing participants ranging in age from 7 to 30 years. The data used for training is independent, as standard MVPA methodology was used to avoid circularity bias. This involved reducing the number of features to the 200 functional connections most reliably different between children and adults in each round of leave-one-out cross-validation.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding process involved using functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) scans, specifically resting-state fcMRI (rs-fcMRI), which measure the correlations in spontaneous activity between brain regions. These scans were collected from typically developing participants ranging in age from 7 to 30 years. Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) time courses were generated for 160 regions of interest (ROIs) derived from meta-analyses of task-related fMRI studies. All possible interregional temporal correlations, or functional connections, were computed for each individual, resulting in 12,720 functional connections.\n\nTo prepare the data for the machine-learning algorithm, standard multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) methodology was employed to avoid circularity bias. This involved reducing the number of features to the 200 functional connections most reliably different between children and adults in each round of leave-one-out cross-validation. This reduction was crucial for building a machine that could predict the functional maturity level of individual brains from about 5 minutes of fMRI data. The use of support vector machines (SVMs) as the classification and prediction algorithms allowed for resilience to overfitting and the extraction of feature weights, which were essential for analyzing the features that drive the multivariate predictor.",
  "optimization/parameters": "The model utilized in our study employs a specific number of parameters tailored to the functional connectivity data. We began with a comprehensive set of 12,720 functional connections derived from 160 regions of interest (ROIs). To enhance the model's efficiency and prevent overfitting, we reduced the number of features to the 200 functional connections that showed the most reliable differences between children and adults. This selection process was conducted using standard multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) methodology to avoid circularity bias.\n\nThe choice of 200 features was informed by the need to balance model complexity and predictive accuracy. This number was determined through a leave-one-out cross-validation approach, ensuring that the selected features were robust and generalizable. The final model, therefore, operates with 200 parameters, which were chosen based on their ability to distinguish between different developmental stages effectively. This approach allowed us to create a functional connectivity maturation index (fcMI) that accurately predicts individual brain maturity.",
  "optimization/features": "The study utilized a total of 12,720 functional connections as potential features, derived from the correlations in spontaneous activity between 160 regions of interest (ROIs) across the brain. To avoid overfitting and ensure robust predictions, feature selection was performed using a standard multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) methodology. This process involved reducing the number of features to the 200 functional connections that were most reliably different between children and adults in each round of leave-one-out cross-validation. This approach ensured that feature selection was done using the training set only, maintaining the integrity of the validation process. The selected features were then used to build a support vector machine (SVM) model for predicting individual brain maturity.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The study employed Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for classification and Support Vector Regression (SVR) for predicting functional brain maturity. SVMs are particularly robust against overfitting, which is crucial given the high-dimensional nature of the data. The feature space consisted of 12,720 functional connections, which is indeed much larger than the number of training points (238 rs-fcMRI scans). To mitigate the risk of overfitting, the number of features was reduced to the 200 most reliable connections through leave-one-out cross-validation. This dimensionality reduction helps in focusing on the most informative features, thereby enhancing the model's generalizability.\n\nAdditionally, the use of Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) weights in model selection ensured that the chosen models were not only accurate but also parsimonious. The models that best fit the data were classic biological growth curves, such as Von Bertalanffy\u2019s growth curve and the Pearl-Reed logistic growth curve, which are known for their asymptotic behavior. These models were selected over linear models, which provided the poorest fits, indicating that a more complex, nonlinear relationship better captured the underlying data.\n\nTo rule out underfitting, the study validated the models across multiple datasets. The same analyses were conducted on two additional large-scale developmental functional connectivity datasets, demonstrating consistent results. This replication across different datasets and types of functional connectivity data (including blocked fMRI designs and event-related fMRI scans) provided strong evidence that the models were not underfitting the data. The consistent performance across datasets also supports the robustness and generalizability of the findings.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed support vector machines (SVMs) as our classification and prediction algorithms. One of the key advantages of using SVMs is their resilience to overfitting. This resilience is particularly important when dealing with high-dimensional data, such as the functional connectivity measurements derived from fMRI scans. Overfitting occurs when a model learns not only the underlying patterns in the data but also the noise, leading to poor generalization to new, unseen data. To mitigate this risk, SVMs use a regularization parameter that controls the trade-off between achieving a low training error and maintaining a smooth decision boundary. This regularization helps to ensure that the model generalizes well to new data, rather than merely memorizing the training examples.\n\nAdditionally, we used a feature reduction technique to avoid circularity bias. We reduced the number of features to the 200 functional connections most reliably different between children and adults in each round of leave-one-out cross-validation. This approach helps to focus on the most relevant features, further reducing the risk of overfitting. By combining these techniques, we aimed to build a robust and generalizable model for predicting individual brain maturity from fMRI data.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a black box. It leverages multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) tools, specifically support vector machines (SVMs), which are known for their ability to provide insights into the features driving predictions. This transparency is crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms of brain maturation.\n\nOne of the key aspects of our approach is the extraction and analysis of feature weights assigned to each functional connection by the predictor. By displaying the 156 consensus features from the support vector regression (SVR) maturity prediction, scaled by their weights, we can visualize the patterns that contribute most significantly to the predictions. This process verified and expanded on findings from prior studies, highlighting the importance of both the segregation of nearby functional areas and the integration of distant regions into functional networks.\n\nThe pattern of feature weights indicated that functional maturation is driven by the weakening of short-range functional connections and the strengthening of long-range functional connections. This finding is consistent with the notion that brain maturation involves both the segregation of specialized brain regions and the integration of these regions into larger, more efficient networks. The results also showed that functional integration is primarily carried by longer-range functional connections along the anterior-posterior axis.\n\nBy grouping brain regions into functional networks, we observed that both integration within functional networks and segregation between them are widely distributed across the cortex and cerebellum. This detailed analysis provides a clear example of how the model's transparency allows for a deeper understanding of the biological processes underlying brain maturation. The ability to interpret the model's predictions in this way is essential for advancing our knowledge of typical brain development and for studying developmental disorders and pediatric-onset neuropsychiatric diseases.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in our study is both a classification and a regression model, depending on the specific application. Initially, we used support vector machines (SVMs) for binary classification to distinguish between children and adults based on their functional brain maturity. This classification was highly accurate, with an accuracy of 91%, a sensitivity of 90%, and a specificity of 92%.\n\nFor a more nuanced assessment of functional brain maturity, we utilized support vector regression (SVR). This regression model predicted a \"brain age\" for each participant, serving as an estimate of their functional maturity level. The predicted brain ages were then converted into a functional connectivity maturation index (fcMI), which provides a weighted index of an individual's overall functional brain maturity.\n\nThe regression model was particularly effective in predicting functional brain maturity levels between the ages of 7 and 30 years. Model selection analyses, using Akaike information criterion (AIC) weights, indicated that classic biological models of asymptotic growth or maturation, such as Von Bertalanffy\u2019s growth curve or the Pearl-Reed logistic growth curve, best fit the data. These models showed that functional brain maturity asymptotically approaches a mean population maximum brain age of approximately 22 years.\n\nThe regression results were consistent across different datasets and types of functional connectivity data, demonstrating the model's robustness and generalizability. The fcMI values derived from the regression model were combined from multiple datasets, resulting in a mixed-type functional connectivity maturation curve that closely matched the pure resting-state functional connectivity maturation curve.\n\nIn summary, the model's output includes both binary classification results for distinguishing between children and adults and continuous predictions of functional brain maturity through regression analysis. This dual approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of individual brain development and maturation.",

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of our method involved several rigorous steps to ensure its accuracy and generalizability. Initially, we employed leave-one-out cross-validation to assess the performance of our support vector machine (SVM) classifier. This approach involved training the classifier on all but one scan and then testing it on the left-out scan, repeating this process for each scan in the dataset. This method helped us to avoid overfitting and provided a robust estimate of the classifier's performance.\n\nWe achieved a high accuracy of 91% in distinguishing between children and adults, with a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 92%. These results were statistically significant, as confirmed by a permutation test with a P-value of less than 0.0001.\n\nTo further evaluate the method, we used SVM regression (SVR) to predict brain age, which served as an estimate of functional brain maturity. We converted the predicted brain ages into a functional connectivity maturation index (fcMI), setting the mean predicted brain age of typically developed young adults (18 to 30 years old) to 1.0. This index provided a weighted measure of an individual's overall functional brain maturity.\n\nModel selection analyses using Akaike information criterion (AIC) weights indicated that the best-fitting models for functional maturity levels between the ages of 7 and 30 years were classic biological models of asymptotic growth, such as Von Bertalanffy\u2019s growth curve or the Pearl-Reed logistic growth curve. These models showed asymptotic maturation toward a predicted population mean maximum brain age of approximately 22 years, corresponding to an fcMI of slightly greater than 1.0.\n\nTo ensure the generalizability of our findings, we replicated the analyses on two additional large-scale developmental functional connectivity datasets with different characteristics. Despite variations in the type of functional connectivity data, the binary adult-versus-child classification results replicated with high accuracy (92% for the second dataset and 93% for the third dataset). The functional brain maturity prediction results also replicated, with r-squared values of 0.519 for the second dataset and 0.557 for the third dataset.\n\nBy combining scans from all three datasets, we created a mixed-type functional connectivity maturation curve that exhibited very similar properties to the pure 3-T resting-state fMRI maturation curve. These findings demonstrate that our fcMRI-based maturation analyses generalize across cohorts and different types of fMRI data.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our evaluation, we primarily focused on accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity as our key performance metrics. For binary classification tasks, such as distinguishing between adults and children, our model achieved an accuracy of 91%, with a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 92%. These metrics were statistically significant, as indicated by a permutation test with a P-value of less than 0.0001.\n\nFor regression tasks, we used the coefficient of determination (r\u00b2) to assess the performance of our Support Vector Regression (SVR) model in predicting brain age. The r\u00b2 values for different datasets were 0.519 and 0.557, indicating a moderate to strong fit between the predicted and actual brain ages.\n\nAdditionally, we employed Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) weights for model selection, which helped us determine the best-fitting models for functional brain maturation. This approach is well-established in the literature and provides a robust way to compare different models.\n\nOverall, our set of metrics is representative of standard practices in the field, ensuring that our results are comparable with other studies. The use of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, r\u00b2, and AIC weights provides a comprehensive evaluation of both classification and regression performance, covering various aspects of model effectiveness.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we did not perform a direct comparison to publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. However, we did compare our approach to simpler baselines to evaluate its effectiveness.\n\nWe used multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) tools, specifically support vector machines (SVMs), to make predictions about individual brain maturity levels. SVMs were chosen for their resilience to overfitting and their ability to extract feature weights. This approach allowed us to make continuously valued predictions about the relative functional maturity levels of individual brains.\n\nTo assess the relative functional brain maturity of individuals more precisely, we used SVM regression (SVR). Chronological age served as the training measure for SVR brain maturity prediction. This method generated a predicted \u201cbrain age\u201d as an estimate of each participant\u2019s functional maturity level.\n\nWe also compared different models of functional brain maturation. Model selection analyses were carried out using Akaike information criterion (AIC) weights. These analyses showed that functional maturity levels between the ages of 7 and 30 years are best fit by classic biological models of asymptotic growth or maturation, such as Von Bertalanffy\u2019s growth curve or the Pearl-Reed logistic growth curve. Linear models generated the poorest fits, indicating that our approach of using asymptotic growth models was more appropriate for capturing the maturation process.\n\nAdditionally, we replicated our analyses on two other large-scale developmental functional connectivity datasets with somewhat different characteristics. Despite these differences, the binary adult-versus-child classification results and functional brain maturity prediction results replicated, demonstrating the robustness of our approach.\n\nIn summary, while we did not compare our method to publicly available benchmarks, we did evaluate it against simpler baselines and demonstrated its effectiveness through replication on different datasets and model comparisons.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our method involved rigorous statistical analyses to ensure the reliability and significance of our results. We employed permutation tests to assess the statistical significance of our classification accuracy, which was found to be highly significant with a P-value of less than 0.0001. This indicates that the observed accuracy is unlikely to have occurred by chance.\n\nIn addition to permutation tests, we used Akaike information criterion (AIC) weights for model selection. This approach helped us identify the best-fitting models for functional brain maturation, which were found to be classic biological models of asymptotic growth. These models provided almost identical curve fits in the age range of 7 to 30 years, demonstrating the robustness of our findings.\n\nThe binary adult-versus-child classification results were replicated across two additional large-scale developmental functional connectivity datasets, with accuracies of 92% and 93% respectively. This replication across different datasets and types of functional connectivity data further supports the generalizability and reliability of our method.\n\nFurthermore, the functional brain maturity prediction results were also replicated in these datasets, with r-squared values of 0.519 and 0.557. These results indicate a strong predictive power of our method, even when applied to different types of functional connectivity data.\n\nOverall, the statistical significance of our results, the replication across multiple datasets, and the use of robust model selection techniques provide strong evidence for the superiority and reliability of our method in predicting functional brain maturity.",
