  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) who underwent surgical treatment. A total of 104 patients were enrolled, with 93 patients in the training/validation set and 11 patients in the test set. The training/validation set included 45 patients with left MTLE and 48 with right MTLE, while the test set included 4 patients with left MTLE and 7 with right MTLE. The dataset consisted of 18F-FDG PET scans and MPRAGE images, which were processed using MATLAB and SPM12 software. The study utilized two personalized atlases: the parcellated Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas using DARTEL and the aparc + aseg atlas from FreeSurfer. These atlases were used to extract normalized PET uptake values from specific regions of interest (ROIs), including the hippocampus and MTLE-associated regions. The dataset was analyzed to determine the lateralization of the epileptogenic side in MTLE patients, with the goal of improving preoperative diagnosis and surgical outcomes. The study also compared the performance of different machine learning classifiers in predicting the lateralization of MTLE. The dataset was analyzed using statistical methods, including Mann-Whitney U tests and Fisher exact tests, and the results were validated using 10-fold cross-validation. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Taipei Veterans General Hospital, and all clinical investigations were conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.",
  "dataset/splits": "In our study, we utilized two primary data splits: a training/validation set and a test set. The training/validation set consisted of 93 patients, with 45 having left mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) and 48 having right MTLE. This cohort included 35 males and 58 females. The median seizure onset age was 13 years, and the median age at surgery was 34 years. After surgery, 2 patients were lost to follow-up within 2 years, leaving 91 patients who completed the postsurgical outcome evaluation. Among these, 77 patients achieved Engel classification I seizure outcomes, indicating a significant improvement.\n\nThe test set comprised 11 patients, with 4 having left MTLE and 7 having right MTLE. This smaller cohort included 4 males and 7 females, with a median seizure onset age of 18 years. Surgical outcomes at 2 years were followed in 5 patients. There were no significant differences in sex, lesion side, onset age, age at operation or sEEG evaluation, seizure duration, or surgical outcome between the patients in the training/validation set and those in the test set. This distribution ensured a robust evaluation of our machine learning models, allowing for both training and independent validation of the results.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset was split into a training/validation set and a test set. The training/validation set consisted of 93 patients, with 45 having left mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) and 48 having right MTLE. The test set included 11 patients, with 4 having left MTLE and 7 having right MTLE. The training/validation set was used to develop and validate the machine learning models, while the test set was used to evaluate the performance of the final models.\n\nThe training and test sets were designed to be independent. This independence was enforced by ensuring that there were no overlapping patients between the two sets. Additionally, there were no significant differences in sex, lesion side, onset age, age at operation or sEEG evaluation, seizure duration, or surgical outcome between the patients in the training/validation set and those in the test set. This independence is crucial for assessing the generalizability of the models to new, unseen data.\n\nThe distribution of the dataset compares favorably to previously published machine learning datasets in the field of epilepsy. The dataset includes a balanced representation of left and right MTLE cases, which is important for training robust models. The use of a separate test set ensures that the models are evaluated on data that was not used during training, providing a more accurate assessment of their performance. This approach aligns with best practices in machine learning, where the goal is to develop models that can generalize well to new data.",
  "dataset/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithms used in this study are well-established and include decision trees, discriminant analysis, logistic regression classifiers, naive Bayes classifiers, support vector machines, nearest neighbor classifiers, and ensemble classifiers. These algorithms are not new and have been extensively used in various fields, including medical imaging and epilepsy research.\n\nThe choice of these algorithms was driven by their proven effectiveness in handling classification problems, particularly in medical imaging where the goal is to accurately classify and lateralize epileptogenic foci in patients with medial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). The algorithms were selected for their ability to process and analyze complex data sets, such as those derived from 18F-FDG PET scans, and to provide reliable and accurate results.\n\nThe study focused on the application of these machine-learning algorithms to a specific medical problem rather than the development of new algorithms. Therefore, it was published in a clinical nuclear medicine journal rather than a machine-learning journal. The emphasis was on demonstrating the practical utility of these algorithms in improving the diagnosis and treatment of MTLE, rather than on advancing the field of machine learning itself. The algorithms were evaluated for their accuracy in lateralizing the epileptogenic side, with the nearest neighbor classifier and support vector machine achieving the highest accuracy rates in the validation folds. This approach highlights the potential of machine learning in enhancing the diagnostic capabilities of 18F-FDG PET in epilepsy surgery.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employed in this study does not function as a meta-predictor. Instead, it utilizes individual machine learning classifiers to determine the lateralization of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) epileptogenic sides. Several machine learning models were trained and validated, including decision trees, discriminant analysis, logistic regression classifiers, naive Bayes classifiers, support vector machines, nearest neighbor classifiers, and ensemble classifiers. Each of these models was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation to assess their performance in classifying the MTLE sides.\n\nThe training data for these models consisted of lateralization indices derived from specific regions of interest (ROIs) in the brain, which were identified using two different atlases: the parcellated AAL atlas using DARTEL and the aparc + aseg atlas from FreeSurfer. The mean standardized uptake value (SUV) of each ROI was calculated, and these values were used to train the models. The goal was to identify the model with the best validation accuracy score for further clinical application.\n\nThe study ensured that the training and validation sets were independent, with a separate test set used to evaluate the final performance of the selected models. This approach helped to validate the generalizability of the models to new, unseen data. The models were trained on a dataset of 93 patients and tested on an independent set of 11 patients, ensuring that the training data was not contaminated by the test data. This independence is crucial for assessing the true performance of the models in clinical settings.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps. Initially, the original DICOM file format of the 18F-FDG PET and MPRAGE images was converted into the 3D NIfTI-1 file format, which is compatible with the Statistical Parametric Mapping program SPM12. This conversion facilitated subsequent image preprocessing.\n\nThe next step involved resetting the image orientation of the 18F-FDG PET and MPRAGE images to roughly align with the anterior commissure of the individual brain space. This alignment improved the registering performance between the 18F-FDG PET and MPRAGE images in SPM12.\n\nFollowing this, the 18F-FDG PET image was registered to the MPRAGE image using 3D voxel registration based on the normalized mutual information method. The MPRAGE image was then segmented into a brain tissue probability map, including gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid.\n\nIntensity normalization of the 18F-FDG PET images was performed using the whole-brain gray matter as a reference region. The intensity-normalized 18F-FDG PET image was then spatially smoothed with a Gaussian smoothing kernel of 8 mm full width at half maximum.\n\nTwo personalized atlases were created: the parcellated Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas using DARTEL and the aparc + aseg atlas from FreeSurfer. These atlases encompassed the anatomical labels used to extract the normalized PET standardized uptake value of the regions of interest (ROIs). The mean standardized uptake value (SUV) of each ROI was obtained by dividing the uptake count by the whole cerebral gray matter. For each subject, the corresponding mean uptake values of 18F-FDG PET were calculated for bilateral ROIs. Additionally, the lateralization index was calculated for each ROI, defined as 2/(L \u2212 R)/(L + R), where L and R represent the uptake values for the left and right hemispheres, respectively.\n\nThe lateralization indices for the parcellated AAL atlas and the aparc + aseg atlas were then submitted to the training/validation set model for classification of patients' MTLE sides. Seven machine learning models, including decision trees, discriminant analysis, logistic regression classifiers, naive Bayes classifiers, support vector machines, nearest neighbor classifiers, and ensemble classifiers, were used to train the model. 10-fold cross-validation was employed to establish the classification model using the classification learner app of MATLAB. The model with the best validation accuracy score was selected for further clinical application.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized two personalized atlases to extract the normalized PET uptake of the regions of interest (ROIs). For the parcellated AAL atlas, we considered 11 MTLE-associated ROIs, while for the aparc + aseg atlas, we included 13 MTLE-associated ROIs. These ROIs were selected based on their relevance to mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) and their potential to provide meaningful data for lateralization.\n\nThe selection of these ROIs was guided by a thorough review of the literature and expert consensus. The ROIs were chosen to ensure that they encompassed the anatomical labels necessary for extracting the normalized PET standardized uptake value. This approach allowed us to focus on the most relevant brain regions for our analysis, thereby optimizing the model's performance.\n\nThe mean standardized uptake value (SUV) of each ROI was obtained by dividing the uptake count by the whole cerebral gray matter. This normalization process helped to account for individual variations in brain metabolism, ensuring that the data were comparable across subjects.\n\nIn summary, the model used 11 parameters for the parcellated AAL atlas and 13 parameters for the aparc + aseg atlas. These parameters were carefully selected to maximize the model's ability to accurately lateralize the epileptogenic side in patients with MTLE.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized two personalized atlases to extract specific anatomical regions of interest (ROIs). For the parcellated AAL atlas, we focused on 11 MTLE-associated ROIs, while for the aparc + aseg atlas, we considered 13 MTLE-associated ROIs. These ROIs were used to calculate the mean standardized uptake value (SUV) for each subject, resulting in 11 and 13 features, respectively, for the two atlases.\n\nFeature selection was implicitly performed by choosing these specific ROIs based on their known association with MTLE. This selection was guided by anatomical and clinical knowledge rather than a statistical feature selection method applied to the training data. The features were derived from the anatomical labels that could be used to extract the normalized PET uptake of the ROIs, ensuring that the selection process was independent of the training set. This approach helped in focusing on the most relevant regions for lateralizing the epileptogenic side in MTLE patients.",
  "optimization/fitting": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our machine learning models. One of the primary methods used was 10-fold cross-validation. This technique involves dividing the dataset into 10 subsets, training the model on 9 of these subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated 10 times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. By averaging the results, we obtained a more reliable estimate of the model's performance and reduced the risk of overfitting to any single subset of the data.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized multiple machine learning classifiers, including decision trees, discriminant analysis, logistic regression classifiers, naive Bayes classifiers, support vector machines, nearest neighbor classifiers, and ensemble classifiers. The diversity of these models helped to mitigate the risk of overfitting by ensuring that our results were not dependent on a single algorithm's idiosyncrasies.\n\nFurthermore, we compared the performance of two different atlases: the parcellated AAL atlas using DARTEL and the aparc + aseg atlas from FreeSurfer. This comparison provided an additional layer of validation, as the models were tested across different anatomical parcellations, reducing the likelihood of overfitting to a specific atlas configuration.\n\nIn summary, our approach to preventing overfitting included the use of 10-fold cross-validation, a variety of machine learning classifiers, and the comparison of different anatomical atlases. These methods collectively enhanced the generalizability and reliability of our findings.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations, optimization schedule, and model files are not explicitly detailed in the publication. The focus is primarily on the methodology and results of the machine learning models used for lateralizing MTLE epileptogenic sides from 18F-FDG PET scans. The study mentions the use of various machine learning classifiers, including decision trees, discriminant analysis, logistic regression classifiers, naive Bayes classifiers, support vector machines, nearest neighbor classifiers, and ensemble classifiers. However, specific details about the hyper-parameter configurations, optimization schedule, and model files are not provided.\n\nThe study does mention the use of MATLAB's classification learner app for training and validating the models, and 10-fold cross-validation was employed to establish the classification model. The best-performing models were selected based on validation accuracy scores. The nearest neighbor classifier model for the parcellated AAL atlas using DARTEL and the support vector machine classifier model for the aparc + aseg atlas from FreeSurfer achieved the highest accuracy rates.\n\nRegarding the availability of optimization parameters, the publication does not provide explicit information on where these parameters can be accessed or under what license. The study emphasizes the development and evaluation of the machine learning models but does not delve into the specifics of the optimization process or the availability of related files.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in this study is not a blackbox. It leverages machine learning classifiers to analyze specific anatomical regions of interest (ROIs) in 18F-FDG PET scans, which are clearly defined and based on established atlases. Two personalized atlases were used: the AAL atlas parcellated using DARTEL and the aparc + aseg atlas from FreeSurfer. These atlases encompass anatomical labels that are relevant for extracting normalized PET uptake values from specific ROIs, particularly those associated with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE).\n\nThe ROIs for the AAL atlas include the superior orbital frontal gyrus, middle orbital frontal gyrus, inferior orbital frontal gyrus, insula, posterior cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, parahippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, temporal pole of superior temporal gyrus, and temporal pole of middle temporal gyrus. For the aparc + aseg atlas, the ROIs include the thalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, entorhinal, lateral orbital gyrus, medial orbital gyrus, posterior cingulate gyrus, temporal pole, insular gyrus, parahippocampus, superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and inferior temporal gyrus.\n\nThe mean standardized uptake value (SUV) of each ROI is obtained by dividing the uptake count by the whole cerebral gray matter. The lateralization index for each ROI is calculated using the formula 2/(L + R) * (L - R)/(L + R), where L and R represent the uptake values for the left and right hemispheres, respectively. This index helps in determining the side of MTLE epileptogenesis.\n\nThe model uses these clearly defined ROIs and their corresponding uptake values to train and validate various machine learning classifiers, including decision trees, discriminant analysis, logistic regression classifiers, naive Bayes classifiers, support vector machines, nearest neighbor classifiers, and ensemble classifiers. The performance of these classifiers is evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation, and the model with the best validation accuracy is selected for further clinical application.\n\nThe transparency of the model is further enhanced by the use of a graphical user interface (GUI), which allows for the incorporation of this method into clinical practice. The GUI facilitates the artificial intelligence (AI) analysis of FDG PET scans, making the process more accessible and interpretable for clinicians. This approach ensures that the model's decisions are based on well-defined anatomical regions and measurable uptake values, providing a clear and interpretable basis for lateralizing the side of MTLE epileptogenesis.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a classification model. It is designed to determine the lateralization of the epileptogenic side in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) using 18F-FDG PET data. The model utilizes machine learning classifiers to analyze the normalized PET uptake of specific regions of interest (ROIs) and classify the data into lateralization epileptogenic foci. Several machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, discriminant analysis, logistic regression classifiers, naive Bayes classifiers, support vector machines, nearest neighbor classifiers, and ensemble classifiers, were employed. The model's performance was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation, and the classifier with the best validation accuracy score was selected for further clinical application. The output of the model provides an accuracy rate for classifying the side of MTLE epileptogenesis, with the nearest neighbor classifier achieving the highest accuracy of 96.8% for the parcellated AAL atlas and the support vector machine classifier achieving 95.7% for the aparc + aseg atlas. In the test set, both the nearest neighbor classifier for the parcellated AAL atlas and the support vector machine classifier for the aparc + aseg atlas attained an accuracy rate of 100.00%.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time for the model varied depending on the method used. The DARTEL method had a significantly shorter computing time, taking approximately 25 minutes. This method could be performed on both Windows and MacOS systems, making it more versatile for different clinical environments. In contrast, the FreeSurfer method required a longer computing time of about 6 hours. Despite the difference in execution times, both methods demonstrated similar performance in terms of accuracy. The shorter execution time of the DARTEL method makes it more practical for clinical use, allowing for quicker processing and integration into routine workflows.",
  "model/availability": "A graphical user interface (GUI) was developed to facilitate the integration of this method into clinical practice. This GUI allows for the artificial intelligence (AI) analysis of FDG PET (qPET) scans, making it accessible for use at different epilepsy centers. The GUI enables the execution of the algorithm, providing a user-friendly interface for clinicians to perform the analysis without needing extensive technical knowledge.\n\nThe GUI can be conducted at various epilepsy centers, allowing for the examination of the algorithm's performance across different settings. This approach ensures that the method is not only accurate but also practical for widespread clinical use. The development of the GUI is a significant step towards making the AI-based lateralization of epileptogenic foci interpretation method readily available and accessible in clinical settings.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the machine-assisted classifier involved several steps to ensure its accuracy and reliability. Initially, the performance of different machine learning classifiers was assessed using a training/validation set consisting of 93 patients. The classifiers were evaluated based on their ability to lateralize the epileptogenic side in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) using two different parcellation methods: the DARTEL method and the aparc + aseg atlas from FreeSurfer. The nearest neighbor classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 96.8% with the parcellated AAL atlas using DARTEL, while the support vector machine classifier attained the best accuracy of 95.7% with the aparc + aseg atlas.\n\nTo further validate the model, a test set of 11 patients was used. The nearest neighbor classifier model for the parcellated AAL atlas using DARTEL achieved an accuracy rate of 100.00% in the test set. Similarly, the support vector machine classifier model for the aparc + aseg atlas also attained an accuracy rate of 100.00% in the test set. This high accuracy in the test set indicates the robustness and generalizability of the model.\n\nAdditionally, the study evaluated the performance of the machine-assisted classifier in patients whose PET asymmetry could not be lateralized by visual analysis. For these 23 patients, the analysis of MTLE-associated regions provided better lateralization compared to the hippocampus alone. The DARTEL method showed an advantage over the FreeSurfer method in these cases, correctly lateralizing the side of MTLE epileptogenesis in 100.0% of the patients when using the MTLE-associated ROI model.\n\nThe evaluation also included a comparison of the machine-assisted method with traditional visual analysis. The accuracy of visual analysis by three physicians was 75.3%, which is lower than the accuracy achieved by the machine-assisted classifiers. This highlights the superior performance of the machine-assisted method in lateralizing the epileptogenic side in MTLE patients.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation method involved a comprehensive assessment using a training/validation set, a test set, and a comparison with traditional visual analysis. The high accuracy rates achieved in both the validation and test sets, along with the superior performance in challenging cases, demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the machine-assisted classifier for lateralizing the epileptogenic side in MTLE patients.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we evaluated the performance of various machine learning classifiers for lateralizing the epileptogenic side in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) patients using FDG PET data. The primary performance metric reported is accuracy, which is expressed as a percentage. This metric indicates the proportion of correctly classified cases out of the total number of cases.\n\nFor classifiers based on associated regions of interest (ROIs), the accuracy ranged from 88.2% to 96.8% across different models. The nearest neighbor classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 96.8% using the parcellated AAL atlas, while the support vector machine classifier attained the best accuracy of 95.7% using the aparc + aseg atlas. These results demonstrate the high effectiveness of machine-assisted classification in lateralizing MTLE.\n\nWhen the analysis was limited to the hippocampus as the sole ROI, the accuracy ranged from 91.4% to 95.7%. The support vector machine classifier performed best, achieving an accuracy of 95.7% in both the parcellated AAL atlas and the aparc + aseg atlas. This indicates that even with a single ROI, the classifiers can achieve high accuracy, though slightly lower than when using multiple associated ROIs.\n\nIn the test set, the nearest neighbor classifier and the support vector machine classifier both achieved a perfect accuracy rate of 100.00%. This outstanding performance in the test set further validates the robustness and reliability of the machine-assisted classification approach.\n\nThe accuracy metrics reported in this study are representative of the current literature on machine learning applications in medical imaging. The high accuracy rates achieved, particularly in the test set, suggest that the proposed method is highly effective and could significantly aid in the preoperative diagnosis of epilepsy surgery. The use of multiple classifiers and the comparison of different atlases provide a comprehensive evaluation of the method's performance, ensuring its reliability and generalizability.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we compared the performance of two different methods for segmenting brain regions: the DARTEL method and FreeSurfer segmentation. Both methods were used to obtain a lateralization index from 18F-FDG PET data, which was then analyzed using various machine learning classifiers.\n\nThe performance of these methods was evaluated using a dataset of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). The accuracy of the classifiers was similar for both methods, with the nearest neighbor classifier achieving the highest accuracy of 96.8% for the parcellated AAL atlas using DARTEL, and the support vector machine classifier achieving 95.7% accuracy for the aparc + aseg atlas from FreeSurfer.\n\nIn terms of practical considerations for clinical use, the DARTEL method has advantages such as shorter computing time (25 minutes compared to 6 hours for FreeSurfer) and compatibility with both Windows and MacOS systems. Additionally, we developed a graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate the incorporation of this method into clinical practice.\n\nWhile we did not compare our methods to publicly available benchmark datasets, our focus was on evaluating the performance of these segmentation methods within the context of our specific clinical application. The comparison to simpler baselines was not explicitly performed, as our primary goal was to assess the effectiveness of these methods in aiding the preoperative diagnosis of epilepsy surgery using 18F-FDG PET scans.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our machine learning classifiers involved a rigorous statistical analysis to ensure the robustness and reliability of our results. We employed 10-fold cross-validation to assess the performance of our models, which provided a comprehensive estimate of their accuracy and generalizability. The performance metrics, including accuracy, were evaluated across different classifiers and atlases, with the nearest neighbor classifier and support vector machine achieving the highest accuracy rates.\n\nStatistical significance was determined using appropriate tests, such as the Mann-Whitney U test and Fisher exact test, to compare continuous and categorical variables between groups. The level of statistical significance was set at P < 0.05, ensuring that our findings were not due to random chance. For instance, the accuracy of the nearest neighbor classifier model in the test set was 100.00%, indicating a highly significant result.\n\nConfidence intervals were not explicitly mentioned for the performance metrics, but the use of cross-validation and statistical tests provides a strong foundation for the reliability of our results. The consistent high accuracy across different models and the statistical significance of our findings support the claim that our machine-assisted classifier is superior to traditional visual analysis methods. The comparison with visual analysis, which showed lower accuracy and higher variability, further underscores the superiority of our approach.",
