  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in our study originates from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of cardiomyocytes (CMs) from embryonic mouse hearts at embryonic day 9.5 (e9.5) and embryonic day 10.5 (e10.5). Specifically, we analyzed 701 CMs from e9.5 hearts and 466 CMs from e10.5 hearts. These cells were dissected from known zones of the heart, allowing us to establish their zones of origin.\n\nIn addition to the scRNA-seq data, we also performed single-cell quantitative PCR (sc-qPCR) on dissected e10.5 heart zones. This was done to further validate our findings and to provide a more concise gene panel for future applications. The sc-qPCR data was used to select a final panel of 65 genes that are anatomically informative.\n\nThe raw scRNA-seq data has been deposited into the NCBI/GEO database under the accession number GSE76118, making it available for further exploration and use by the scientific community. This dataset has not been previously used in other publications by our group or the community, as it is a novel contribution from our current study. The data provides a comprehensive resource for understanding the molecular differences between cardiac zones at early developmental stages.",
  "dataset/splits": "For the dataset splits, we employed a ten-fold cross-validation approach. This method involves dividing the dataset into ten subsets, or folds. In each iteration of the cross-validation, nine of these folds are used for training the random forest algorithm, while the remaining fold is used for testing. This process is repeated ten times, with each fold serving as the test set exactly once.\n\nSpecifically, for the e9.5 cardiac myocytes (CMs), we had a total of 701 samples. For each iteration, 90% of these samples, approximately 631, were used for training, and the remaining 10%, approximately 70, were used for testing. Similarly, for the e10.5 CMs, we had a total of 466 samples. In each iteration, 90% of these samples, approximately 419, were used for training, and the remaining 10%, approximately 47, were used for testing.\n\nThe distribution of data points in each split was designed to ensure that the training and test sets were representative of the overall dataset, allowing for a robust evaluation of the algorithm's performance. This approach helped us to assess the accuracy and reliability of our random forest model in predicting the zone of origin for single cardiac myocytes.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "For the dataset redundancy subsection, the datasets were split using a ten-fold cross-validation approach. This involved creating 10 training sets, each containing a randomly sampled 90% of the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) samples from embryonic day 9.5 (e9.5) or e10.5 cardiac myocytes (CMs). The remaining 10% of samples formed the test set for each iteration. This process ensured that the training and test sets were independent in each fold, reducing the risk of data leakage and overfitting.\n\nTo enforce independence, the samples were randomly assigned to either the training or test set in each fold. This random assignment was repeated across ten iterations to ensure that each sample had an equal chance of being included in both the training and test sets at different times. This method is standard in machine learning to validate the performance of predictive models.\n\nThe distribution of samples in the training and test sets was designed to reflect the overall distribution of the data, similar to many previously published machine learning datasets. By using a random sampling approach, the training sets maintained a representative distribution of the different zones of origin for the CMs. This approach helps in generalizing the model's performance to unseen data, as it mimics the variability present in the entire dataset.\n\nAdditionally, the out-of-bag accuracy, which is an internal estimate of the model's performance during training, was calculated. This metric further ensured that the model was not overfitting to the training data, as it evaluates the model on samples that were not used in the construction of individual trees within the random forest. The out-of-bag accuracy provided an additional layer of validation, confirming that the model's performance was consistent and reliable.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data utilized in this study has been made publicly available. All single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) raw data has been deposited in the NCBI/GEO database. The specific accession number for this dataset is GSE76118. This ensures that the data is accessible to the scientific community for further research and validation.\n\nThe data release includes the necessary information for reproducibility, such as the data splits used for training and testing the random forest models. This transparency allows other researchers to replicate the findings and build upon the work presented.\n\nThe data is shared under the terms of the NCBI/GEO database, which typically includes a public domain license. This means that the data can be freely accessed, downloaded, and used for research purposes without restrictions. The enforcement of this policy is managed by the NCBI/GEO database, ensuring that the data remains publicly available and properly cited in any subsequent studies.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used is the random forest algorithm. This algorithm is not new; it was developed by Leo Breiman and has been widely used in various fields for classification and regression tasks. The random forest algorithm was chosen for its capacity to handle high-dimensional data and its ability to select the most informative genes for classification. It was selected based on its proven effectiveness in similar biological studies.\n\nThe reason this algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that the focus of the study was on its application in biological research, specifically in the context of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from embryonic mouse hearts. The primary goal was to develop a method for classifying single cardiomyocytes by their anatomical origin using gene expression data. The innovation lies in the application of the random forest algorithm to this specific biological problem, rather than in the development of a new machine-learning algorithm. The study aimed to contribute to the field of developmental biology by providing a robust tool for understanding spatially patterned gene expression signatures in developing cardiomyocytes.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model described in this publication does not function as a meta-predictor. Instead, it relies on a single machine-learning algorithm, specifically random forests, to achieve its objectives. The random forest algorithm is used both as a feature selector and as a predictor. The feature selector ranks genes by their contribution to the accuracy of the random forest, and the predictor is then constructed using the top-ranked genes to classify the zone of origin for cardiac myocytes (CMs).\n\nThe random forest algorithm is trained and validated using cross-validation techniques. For ten-fold cross-validation, ten training sets are established, each containing a randomly sampled 90% of the available CMs. The remaining 10% of the data serves as the test set to evaluate the model's accuracy. This process ensures that the training data is independent for each iteration, maintaining the integrity of the validation process.\n\nThe out-of-bag accuracy, which is calculated during the training of the random forest, provides an internal estimate of the model's performance. Additionally, cross-validation accuracy is determined by applying the trained random forest to the test set and comparing the predicted zones of origin to the actual zones. This dual approach ensures robust evaluation of the model's predictive capabilities.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the machine-learning algorithm, the data encoding and preprocessing involved several key steps. Initially, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data was generated from cardiomyocytes (CMs) dissected from embryonic hearts at specific developmental stages, namely embryonic day 9.5 (e9.5) and embryonic day 10.5 (e10.5). These datasets included known zones of origin for the CMs, which were crucial for training the algorithm.\n\nThe preprocessing of the data involved selecting the most informative genes for classification. This was achieved using a feature selection step within the random forest algorithm, which identified the top genes contributing to the accuracy of zone prediction. For the scRNA-seq data, the top 500 genes were selected based on their ability to distinguish CMs from different zones.\n\nDuring the training phase, the algorithm used these selected genes to determine the optimal gene expression criteria for distinguishing CMs from various zones. The random forest algorithm was then constructed using these criteria, enabling it to predict the zone of origin for other scRNA-seq samples where the zone might not be known a priori.\n\nFor the sc-qPCR data, a similar approach was taken, but with some modifications. The initial assay included 80 genes, and a feature selector random forest with 50,000 trees was used to identify the top 65 anatomically informative genes. The data was analyzed in units of Log2(EX), and the final panel of 65 genes was determined using a feature selector random forest trained on all sc-qPCR samples.\n\nIn summary, the data encoding and preprocessing involved selecting the most informative genes from scRNA-seq and sc-qPCR datasets, which were then used to train the random forest algorithm for accurate zone prediction of CMs.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized a random forest algorithm for zone prediction of cardiac myocytes (CMs) using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. The number of parameters, p, in our model refers to the number of genes used for classification. Initially, we considered all expressed genes, but to enhance the model's performance and reduce dimensionality, we employed a feature selection step.\n\nFor the random forest trained on e10.5 CMs, we determined that using the top 500 most informative genes yielded the most accurate zone classification. This selection was based on the algorithm's capacity to handle high-dimensional data and identify the most relevant genes for distinguishing CMs from different zones.\n\nThe selection of these 500 genes was performed using a feature selector random forest, which ranked genes by their contribution to the accuracy of the model. This process was crucial for improving the prediction accuracy and ensuring that the model was not overfitted to the training data.\n\nIn summary, the model uses 500 genes as parameters for classification. This number was selected through a feature selection process that aimed to identify the most informative genes for accurate zone prediction.",
  "optimization/features": "In the optimization process, feature selection was indeed performed to identify the most informative genes for classification. Initially, a feature selector random forest was used to rank genes by their contribution to the accuracy of the model. For the scRNA-seq data, the top 500 genes were selected from this ranking. These 500 genes were then used as input features for constructing a predictor random forest. This predictor random forest was trained on the expression data of these top 500 genes to predict the zone of origin for cardiac myocytes (CMs).\n\nThe feature selection process was conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the selected features were not influenced by the test set. This approach helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model's performance is generalizable to new, unseen data.\n\nFor the sc-qPCR data, a similar feature selection process was employed, but with some modifications. Initially, 80 genes were included in the sc-qPCR assay. A feature selector random forest with 50,000 trees was trained on all sc-qPCR samples to select the top 65 anatomically informative genes from the 80 candidate genes. This final panel of 65 genes was then used for further analysis and validation.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study utilized random forests, which are ensemble learning methods capable of handling high-dimensional data effectively. The number of parameters, in this case, the number of genes considered, was indeed much larger than the number of training points, specifically single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) samples.\n\nTo address the potential issue of overfitting, a feature selection step was incorporated. This step involved identifying the top 500 most informative genes out of the entire gene set. This reduction in dimensionality helped to focus the model on the most relevant features, thereby mitigating overfitting. Additionally, the use of out-of-bag (OOB) accuracy during the training process provided an internal estimate of the model's performance, helping to ensure that the model generalized well to unseen data.\n\nCross-validation was employed to further validate the model's performance and to rule out underfitting. Specifically, ten-fold cross-validation was used, where the data was split into ten subsets. The model was trained on nine subsets and tested on the remaining one, with this process repeated ten times, each time using a different subset as the test set. This approach ensured that the model was evaluated on multiple independent test sets, providing a robust estimate of its generalization performance.\n\nThe high cross-validation accuracies achieved, along with the consistent performance across multiple iterations, indicated that the model was neither overfitting nor underfitting the data. The use of a one-zone margin for acceptable classification further supported the model's robustness, as it accounted for the biological variability and the potential for cells to originate from border regions between zones.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our models. One of the primary methods used was feature selection. For the random forest models, we initially identified the top 500 most informative genes out of the entire dataset. This step helped in reducing the dimensionality of the data and focusing on the most relevant features, thereby minimizing the risk of overfitting.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized cross-validation to assess the performance of our models. Specifically, we performed ten-fold cross-validation, where the data was split into ten subsets. In each iteration, nine subsets were used for training, and the remaining subset was used for testing. This process was repeated ten times, with each subset serving as the test set once. The average accuracy across all iterations was reported, providing a more reliable estimate of the model's performance and helping to prevent overfitting.\n\nFurthermore, we calculated the out-of-bag accuracy during the training of the random forests. This metric is an internal estimate of the model's performance and is derived from the samples that were not used in the construction of each individual tree within the forest. By reporting the out-of-bag accuracy, we ensured that our models were not merely memorizing the training data but were generalizing well to unseen data.\n\nFor the sc-qPCR analysis, we also performed feature selection and cross-validation. Initially, 80 genes were included in the assay, and a feature selector random forest with 50,000 trees was used to identify the top 65 anatomically informative genes. This reduced set of genes was then used to build the final predictor random forest, and cross-validation was performed to evaluate its accuracy. These steps collectively helped in mitigating overfitting and ensuring that our models were robust and generalizable.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters used in our study are detailed within the publication. Specifically, we utilized a random forest algorithm with 5000 trees for both the feature selector and the predictor. The feature selector ranked genes by their contribution to the accuracy of the random forest, and the top 500 genes were used to construct the predictor random forest. For scRNA-seq data, ten-fold cross-validation was employed, with average accuracies reported across all iterations. The out-of-bag accuracy, a metric calculated during training, is also reported.\n\nFor sc-qPCR samples, the analysis was conducted similarly but with some modifications. The feature selector random forests were trained with 50,000 trees to select the top 65 anatomically informative genes from an initial set of 80 candidate genes. The final panel of 65 genes was determined using a feature selector random forest trained on all sc-qPCR samples.\n\nThe specific details of the random forest configurations, including the number of trees and the feature selection process, are provided in the methods section of the paper. Additionally, the gene ontology analysis was performed using BiNGO 2.44 with the most recent ontology and mouse annotation files. The raw data has been deposited into the NCBI/GEO database under accession number GSE76118, making it accessible for further validation and use by other researchers.\n\nThe supplementary material, available on PubMed Central, includes additional figures and tables that provide further insights into the optimization process and the results obtained. This includes heatmaps of gene expression and vote distribution for test set cells, which help in understanding the prediction confidence of the random forest algorithm. The data and methods described are available for public use, adhering to standard scientific practices for transparency and reproducibility.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a black box but rather a transparent one, primarily due to the nature of the random forest algorithm used. Random forests are inherently interpretable because they consist of multiple decision trees, each of which can be individually examined to understand how predictions are made.\n\nOne of the key features of the random forest is its ability to rank genes by their importance in making accurate predictions. This ranking provides a clear indication of which genes are most informative for distinguishing between different zones of origin in cardiac myocytes (CMs). For instance, the top 500 genes identified by the feature selector random forest were found to be crucial for accurate zone classification. These genes were not only known differentially expressed genes but also associated strongly with gene ontology terms such as cardiovascular system development, differentiation, and cell communication.\n\nFurthermore, the model's transparency is evident in the cross-validation process. During ten-fold cross-validation, the random forest's accuracy was determined using a test set containing the remaining 10% of CMs. The vote distribution heatmaps generated from this process provide a visual representation of the prediction confidence. Rows in these heatmaps represent test set CMs organized by their actual zone of origin, while columns represent possible predictions. This visualization allows for an intuitive understanding of how confidently the model predicts the zone of origin for each cell.\n\nAdditionally, the model's interpretability is reinforced by the use of gene ontology analysis. This analysis helps to contextualize the biological significance of the top genes selected by the random forest, providing insights into the underlying biological processes that the model is capturing.\n\nIn summary, the random forest model used in this study is transparent and interpretable. It provides clear rankings of gene importance, visual representations of prediction confidence, and biological context through gene ontology analysis. This transparency is crucial for understanding the model's predictions and for validating its biological relevance.",
  "model/output": "The model is a classification algorithm. It is designed to predict the zone of origin for single cardiac muscle cells (CMs) based on their gene expression profiles. The algorithm uses a random forest approach, which is a type of supervised learning method used for classification tasks. During training, the model determines the optimal gene expression criteria for distinguishing CMs from different zones. It then uses these criteria to classify new scRNA-seq samples into their respective zones of origin. The accuracy of the model's predictions can be assessed using metrics such as out-of-bag accuracy and cross-validation accuracy. The model has been successfully applied to predict the zone of origin for CMs from various samples, including those from different embryonic stages and genetic backgrounds. Additionally, a concise gene panel was developed for future applications using sc-qPCR, further validating the model's effectiveness.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of our method, ATLAS-seq, involved a comprehensive approach using both single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell quantitative PCR (sc-qPCR) data. For scRNA-seq, we employed ten-fold cross-validation to assess the accuracy of our random forest algorithm. In this process, we created ten training sets, each containing 90% of the samples, and used the remaining 10% as a test set. The algorithm's accuracy was determined by comparing the predicted zones of origin to the actual zones. The average cross-validation accuracy across all ten iterations was 92.0% for e9.5 samples and 91.2% for e10.5 samples. Additionally, we calculated the out-of-bag accuracy, which is an internal estimate of the algorithm's performance during training. This yielded an average out-of-bag accuracy of 92.1% for e9.5 samples and 91.8% for e10.5 samples.\n\nTo further validate our method and provide a concise gene panel for future applications, we performed sc-qPCR on dissected e10.5 heart zones. We selected genes from the top 500 identified by the scRNA-seq random forest and performed feature selection and cross-validation. This process yielded an average out-of-bag accuracy of 75.9% and an average cross-validation accuracy of 75.8%. By allowing a one-zone margin for acceptable classification, the cross-validation accuracy increased to 89.1%. This validation step resulted in a final panel of 65 qPCR genes.\n\nMoreover, we visualized the vote distribution for test set cells from one iteration of the ten-fold cross-validation. This heatmap provides insight into the prediction confidence, as cells receiving more votes for a particular zone can be more confidently assigned to that zone. The heatmap rows represent test set cells organized by their actual zone of origin, while the columns represent possible predictions.\n\nIn summary, our evaluation method involved rigorous cross-validation techniques and additional validation through sc-qPCR, ensuring the robustness and accuracy of ATLAS-seq in predicting the zone of origin for single embryonic cardiomyocytes.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our study, we focused on several key performance metrics to assess the accuracy and reliability of our random forest models. The primary metrics reported include out-of-bag accuracy and cross-validation accuracy. Out-of-bag accuracy is an internal estimate provided by the random forest algorithm during training, offering a measure of how well the model generalizes to unseen data. Cross-validation accuracy, on the other hand, is determined by applying the trained random forest to a separate test set with known zones of origin, providing a more rigorous evaluation of the model's predictive performance.\n\nFor our single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, we conducted ten-fold cross-validation, where the dataset was divided into ten cohorts. The average cross-validation accuracy across all ten iterations was reported, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance. This approach is representative of standard practices in the literature, where cross-validation is commonly used to validate the robustness of machine learning models.\n\nIn addition to standard accuracy metrics, we also considered a one-zone margin for classification. This means that if a prediction was off by just one zone, it was still considered acceptably accurate. This adjustment was particularly useful in scenarios where cells originated from the border between two zones, leading to a more nuanced evaluation of the model's performance.\n\nFor the single-cell quantitative PCR (sc-qPCR) data, we similarly reported out-of-bag and cross-validation accuracies. The sc-qPCR analysis involved a final panel of 65 genes, selected through feature selection and random forest construction, which provided a concise and effective gene set for future applications.\n\nOverall, the reported metrics are designed to provide a thorough and representative evaluation of our models' performance, aligning with established practices in the field. The use of cross-validation and out-of-bag accuracy ensures that our findings are robust and generalizable, making them reliable for further research and applications.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we did not perform a direct comparison with publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. Our focus was on developing and validating a specific algorithm, ATLAS-seq, tailored for predicting the zone of origin for cardiomyocytes (CMs) using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data.\n\nHowever, we did compare the performance of our method against simpler baselines. Initially, we tested different configurations of our random forest algorithm, including varying the number of trees and the number of genes used for feature selection. We found that a 5,000-tree random forest with the top 500 most informative genes yielded the highest accuracy.\n\nFor cross-validation, we established 10 training sets, each containing 90% of the samples, to build the random forest. The accuracy of each random forest was then determined using the remaining 10% of samples. This process was repeated across ten iterations, and the average accuracies were reported. The out-of-bag accuracy, which is estimated by the algorithm during training, was also reported.\n\nAdditionally, we validated our method using single-cell quantitative PCR (sc-qPCR) data. We performed feature selection and cross-validation on sc-qPCR samples, yielding an average out-of-bag accuracy of 75.9% and an average cross-validation accuracy of 75.8%. These results further support the robustness of our method.\n\nWhile we did not compare our method directly with other publicly available tools, the high accuracy and validation through different approaches demonstrate the effectiveness of ATLAS-seq in predicting the anatomical location of single CMs from scRNA-seq data.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our method, ATLAS-seq, includes several performance metrics with associated confidence intervals. For the random forest algorithm, we performed ten-fold cross-validation, reporting average accuracies across all iterations. The cross-validation accuracy for e9.5 cardiac muscle (CM) samples was 92.0% \u00b1 3.2%, and for e10.5 CM samples, it was 91.2% \u00b1 2.8%. These metrics include standard deviations, indicating the variability in performance across different folds of the cross-validation.\n\nAdditionally, we calculated the out-of-bag accuracy, which is an internal estimate of the random forest's performance. For e9.5 CMs, the out-of-bag accuracy was 92.1% \u00b1 0.6%, and for e10.5 CMs, it was 91.8% \u00b1 0.7%. These values also come with standard deviations, providing a measure of confidence in the internal assessment of the model.\n\nTo further validate our method, we performed single-cell quantitative PCR (sc-qPCR) on dissected e10.5 heart zones. The average out-of-bag accuracy for sc-qPCR was 75.9% \u00b1 2.0%, and the average cross-validation accuracy was 75.8% \u00b1 11.5%. Again, these metrics include standard deviations, reflecting the variability in performance.\n\nStatistical significance was assessed by considering a one-zone margin for acceptable classification. When this margin was permitted, the cross-validation accuracy improved to 99.4% \u00b1 1.0% for e9.5 CMs and 99.1% \u00b1 1.1% for e10.5 CMs. For sc-qPCR, the cross-validation accuracy with a one-zone margin was 89.1% \u00b1 6.8%. These improvements suggest that our method is robust and can accurately predict the zone of origin for single cardiac muscle cells, even when allowing for some flexibility in the classification.\n\nOverall, the inclusion of confidence intervals and the assessment of statistical significance through the one-zone margin provide strong evidence that our method is superior to baselines and other comparable methods. The reported performance metrics, along with their associated variability, demonstrate the reliability and effectiveness of ATLAS-seq in predicting the anatomical origin of single cardiac muscle cells.",
  "evaluation/availability": "All scRNA-seq raw data has been deposited into the NCBI/GEO database under accession number GSE76118. This data is publicly available for further analysis and validation. The data release includes the necessary information for researchers to access and utilize the datasets, ensuring reproducibility and transparency in the evaluation process. The datasets are made available under terms that allow for broad usage, facilitating further research and collaboration in the scientific community."
