  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was collected from participants at the Kangda Voluntary Drug Rehabilitation Center. The final dataset comprised 36 individuals with methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) and 37 healthy controls (HCs). Participants with incomplete or abnormal scans, or excessive head motion during image preprocessing, were excluded from the analysis.\n\nThe demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants were summarized in a table. The MUD group had an average age of 31.06 years and an average of 11.42 years of education. The duration of self-reported methamphetamine use was approximately 6.17 years, with an average dose of 0.36 grams per use. The withdrawal time from methamphetamine was about 63.83 days. The frequency of methamphetamine use varied, with some participants using it daily and others less frequently.\n\nThis dataset has not been used in previous publications by the authors or the community. The data was specifically collected and processed for this study to investigate the potential of combining functional connectivity (FC) data with support vector machine (SVM)-based techniques to distinguish MUD patients from healthy subjects. The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors upon request.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in this study is Support Vector Machine (SVM). SVM is a well-established and widely used algorithm for classification tasks in machine learning. It is not a new algorithm; it has been extensively studied and applied in various fields, including neuroscience and medical imaging.\n\nThe choice of SVM for this study was driven by its proven effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data and its robustness to noise, which are crucial for analyzing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data. SVM's ability to find the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between different classes makes it particularly suitable for distinguishing between individuals with methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) and healthy controls.\n\nThe reason this algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that the focus of this study is on its application in neuroscience, specifically in the context of identifying biomarkers for MA addiction. The primary contribution of this work lies in demonstrating the utility of SVM in classifying rs-fMRI data to differentiate between MUD patients and healthy controls, rather than in the development of a new machine-learning algorithm. The study aims to advance the understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying MA addiction and to explore the potential of machine learning techniques in clinical diagnostics and treatment.",
  "optimization/meta": "Not applicable. The model described in the study is a support vector machine (SVM)-based machine learning approach applied directly to resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data. It does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. The SVM classifier is trained on functional connectivity (FC) data derived from rs-fMRI scans of individuals with methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) and healthy controls (HCs). The feature selection process involves neighborhood component analysis (NCA), but this is used to identify the most relevant features from the FC data rather than as a separate machine-learning algorithm whose output is used as input. The study focuses on distinguishing MUD patients from healthy subjects using FC data and SVM-based techniques, without involving a meta-predictor framework.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding process involved generating a 246 \u00d7 246 whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) matrix for each subject. This matrix was then converted through Fisher\u2019s r-to-Z transformation into binary, undirected connection matrices. This transformation is crucial for stabilizing the variance of the correlation coefficients and making the data suitable for subsequent machine learning analyses.\n\nFeature selection was performed using neighborhood component analysis (NCA), a method that learns the Mahalanobis distance metric in the k-nearest neighbor classification algorithm. NCA is particularly useful because it does not assume any parametric distribution of the features and is suitable for multiclass classification using high-dimensional features. This method facilitated the selection of the most relevant features by assigning weights and minimizing the cross-validation error of the training data. Features with non-zero weights were retained and fed into a linear support vector machine (SVM) for classification.\n\nThe SVM classifier was implemented using the LIBSVM classification library. The training process involved finding the optimum hyperplane that separated the training data by the maximum margin. This hyperplane was used to predict labels for new datasets of features derived from observations. The classification performance was assessed using permutation tests, where the class labels of the training data were randomly changed, and leave-one-out cross-validation was performed on the permuted dataset. This process was repeated 10,000 times to estimate the statistical significance of the classification accuracy. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated to quantify the prediction performance of the classifiers. Additionally, the area under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUC) was calculated to quantify the classification power, with a greater AUC indicating higher classification power.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized a feature selection method called neighborhood component analysis (NCA) to determine the most relevant features for our model. This process involved converting whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) matrices into binary, undirected connection matrices through Fisher\u2019s r-to-Z transformation. The resulting matrices were then used to identify features that contributed significantly to the classification task.\n\nThe number of parameters, p, in our model was not fixed a priori but was determined through the feature selection process. NCA facilitated the selection of features by assigning weights to them based on their importance in minimizing the cross-validation error of the training data. Features with non-zero weights were retained, resulting in a subset of the most discriminative features.\n\nSpecifically, 18 features with non-zero weights were selected and fed into a linear support vector machine (SVM) for classification. These features were identified as the most powerful discriminative features, enabling the SVM to effectively distinguish between individuals with methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) and healthy controls.\n\nThe selection of these features was driven by the need to improve the model's performance and reduce dimensionality, ensuring that only the most relevant connections were used for classification. This approach helped in identifying key brain regions and connections that are potentially associated with MUD, thereby enhancing the model's predictive power.",
  "optimization/features": "The input features for our study consisted of functional connectivity (FC) data derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Specifically, we generated a 246 \u00d7 246 whole-brain FC matrix for each subject, which underwent Fisher\u2019s r-to-Z transformation into binary, undirected connection matrices.\n\nFeature selection was performed using neighborhood component analysis (NCA). This method is particularly suitable for high-dimensional feature spaces and does not assume any parametric distribution of the features. It facilitated the selection of the most relevant features by learning the Mahalanobis distance metric in the k-nearest neighbor classification algorithm. The features assigned with non-zero weights were retained and fed into a linear support vector machine (SVM) for classification.\n\nThe feature selection process was conducted using the training dataset only, ensuring that the selected features were not influenced by the test data. This approach helped in minimizing the cross-validation error of the training data and in identifying the most powerful discriminative features. As a result, 18 features with non-zero weights were screened out and used for the subsequent classification task.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The study employed a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, which is known for its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces. The number of parameters, in this case, the features derived from the functional connectivity (FC) matrices, was indeed larger than the number of training points. To address potential overfitting, several strategies were implemented.\n\nFirstly, feature selection was performed using neighborhood component analysis (NCA). This method helped in selecting the most relevant features by learning the Mahalanobis distance metric, thereby reducing the dimensionality of the data and mitigating the risk of overfitting. Only features assigned with non-zero weights were retained and fed into the SVM.\n\nSecondly, the classification performance was assessed using a framework of permutation tests. This involved randomly changing the class labels of the training data and performing leave-one-out cross-validation on the permuted dataset. This process was repeated 10,000 times to estimate the statistical significance of the classification accuracy. The classi\ufb01cation performance was regarded as reliable when the generalization rate obtained by the classi\ufb01er trained on the real class labels exceeded the 95% confidence interval of the classi\ufb01er trained on randomly relabeled class labels.\n\nTo ensure that the model was not underfitting, the classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUC) was also computed, with a greater AUC indicating a higher classification power. The high classification accuracy of 88%, along with a sensitivity of 86.84% and specificity of 89.19%, and an AUC of 0.94, demonstrated that the model was able to generalize well to the data, indicating that underfitting was not a concern.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our classification model. One key method used was feature selection through neighborhood component analysis (NCA). This technique helped in identifying the most relevant features by learning the Mahalanobis distance metric in the k-nearest neighbor classification algorithm. By selecting features with non-zero weights, we effectively reduced the dimensionality of our data, which in turn helped to minimize overfitting.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized permutation tests to assess the statistical significance of our classification performance. This involved randomly changing the class labels of the training data and performing leave-one-out cross-validation on the permuted dataset. This process was repeated 10,000 times to ensure that the generalization rate obtained by the classifier trained on the real class labels exceeded the 95% confidence interval of the classifier trained on randomly relabeled class labels. This rigorous approach helped to validate the reliability of our model and prevent overfitting.\n\nFurthermore, we implemented a support vector machine (SVM) classifier using the LIBSVM classification library. SVM is known for its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces and is less prone to overfitting compared to other algorithms. The use of SVM, combined with our feature selection method and permutation tests, provided a robust framework for classifying individuals with methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) from healthy controls.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not entirely a black box, as it incorporates several transparent components that contribute to its interpretability. The use of neighborhood component analysis (NCA) for feature selection is one such component. NCA assigns weights to features, allowing for the identification of the most discriminative features. Features with non-zero weights are retained and fed into a linear support vector machine (SVM), enabling the direct interpretation of feature importance based on their weighted coefficients.\n\nThe linear SVM used in this study is particularly advantageous for interpretability. The importance of each feature is directly related to its weighted coefficient, which facilitates the identification of the most powerful discriminative features. For instance, the top six discriminative features were found to be primarily involved in key nodes of the default mode network (DMN) subsystems. Additionally, the remaining 12 discriminative features were related to thalamic connections within the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) loop. This transparency allows for a clear understanding of which brain regions and connections are most relevant to distinguishing individuals with methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) from healthy controls.\n\nFurthermore, the study performed Spearman correlation analyses between the discriminative features and methamphetamine (MA) measures. This analysis revealed significant positive correlations between the duration of MA use and specific functional connectivity (FC) measures, such as the FC between the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and right cingulate gyrus (CG), as well as the FC between the left IPL and right CG. These correlations provide additional insights into the behavioral significance of the identified features, enhancing the overall interpretability of the model.\n\nIn summary, the model's use of NCA for feature selection and a linear SVM for classification, along with the correlation analyses performed, contributes to its transparency. These components allow for the identification and interpretation of the most discriminative features, providing valuable insights into the neural mechanisms underlying MUD.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in our study is a classification model. Specifically, we utilized a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to distinguish individuals with methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) from healthy controls.

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method employed in this study involved a rigorous framework of permutation tests to assess the classification performance of the support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The actual value of classification accuracy obtained from the SVM analysis was used as the statistic for these tests. To estimate the statistical significance of this value, the class labels of the training data were randomly permuted, and leave-one-out cross-validation was performed on the permuted dataset. This permutation process was repeated 10,000 times. The classification performance was considered reliable if the generalization rate obtained by the classifier trained on the real class labels exceeded the 95% confidence interval of the classifier trained on randomly relabeled class labels.\n\nAdditionally, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated to quantify the prediction performance of the classifiers. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUC) was also computed to quantify the classification power, with a greater AUC indicating higher classification power. The classifier achieved an accuracy of 88%, with a sensitivity of 86.84% and a specificity of 89.19%. The AUC for the classifier was 0.94, demonstrating strong classification performance.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed several performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of our support vector machine (SVM) classifier in distinguishing individuals with methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) from healthy controls using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data. The primary metrics reported include accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).\n\nAccuracy measures the overall correctness of the classifier, indicating the proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined. Our classifier achieved an accuracy of 88%, demonstrating a high level of overall performance.\n\nSensitivity, also known as the true positive rate, assesses the classifier's ability to correctly identify individuals with MUD. Our model achieved a sensitivity of 86.84%, indicating a strong capability to detect MUD cases.\n\nSpecificity, or the true negative rate, evaluates the classifier's ability to correctly identify healthy controls. Our specificity was 89.19%, showing a robust performance in distinguishing healthy individuals from those with MUD.\n\nThe AUC provides a comprehensive measure of the classifier's performance across all classification thresholds. An AUC of 0.94 was obtained, signifying excellent discriminative power. This metric is particularly useful as it summarizes the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity across various threshold settings.\n\nThese metrics are representative of those commonly used in the literature for evaluating machine learning models in neuroimaging studies. They provide a clear and comprehensive assessment of the classifier's performance, ensuring that our findings are comparable to other studies in the field. The high values obtained for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC indicate that our SVM-based approach is effective and reliable for distinguishing MUD patients from healthy controls.",

This analysis examined the correlations between the FC features used in the support vector machine (SVM) and various methamphetamine (MA) measures, such as the duration of MA use, average frequency of use, average dose, and withdrawal time. The statistical significance level was set at p < 0.05.\n\nThe results indicated that the duration of MA use was significantly positively correlated with specific FC connections, suggesting that these features are not only discriminative but also behaviorally relevant. The overall performance metrics, including an accuracy of 88%, sensitivity of 86.84%, and specificity of 89.19%, along with an AUC of 0.94, demonstrate the robustness and reliability of our classification model. These findings support the claim that our method is superior to previous studies using similar or different modalities, providing a strong basis for the potential use of FC data and SVM-based techniques in diagnosing MUD.",
