  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study is sourced from the MIMIC-IV (version 1.0) critical care database. This database is publicly available and contains a comprehensive range of health-related data on patients admitted to the ICU at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center from 2008 to 2019. The data includes vital signs, medications, laboratory test results, comorbid diagnoses, imaging reports, and survival data.\n\nThe MIMIC-IV database is an extensive resource, encompassing clinical data from over 60,000 patients. This dataset is the latest iteration in the MIMIC series, following MIMIC-II and MIMIC-III, and it provides detailed information regarding a patient\u2019s entire hospital stay. Unlike its predecessors, MIMIC-IV has not been extensively studied in the context of sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) until now.\n\nPrevious studies have primarily utilized the MIMIC-III dataset or local ICU data to develop prediction models for mortality or poor prognosis in patients with SA-AKI. These models have shown effectiveness by incorporating general severity scores, population data, comorbidities, infection indicators, and renal function, among other relevant factors. However, the transition to MIMIC-IV offers a more robust and comprehensive dataset, potentially enhancing the accuracy and reliability of prognostic models.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was split into multiple parts to facilitate model development and evaluation. Initially, the dataset was divided into training/validation sets and a development set. The development set was further split into M halves to construct M feature rankers. Additionally, ten-fold cross-validation was employed, dividing the full development set into ten segments. This process involved creating subsets from these segments to rank features based on their significance. The final model was evaluated using a test set, which was used to confirm the model's discrimination and calibration. The development set was used to build the model and select features. The specific number of data points in each split is not detailed, but the process ensures a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset used in this study was obtained from the MIMIC-IV (version 1.0) critical care database, which contains a wide range of health-related data on patients admitted to the ICU. The primary outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality.\n\nThe dataset was split into development and validation queues with an 8:2 ratio. This means that 80% of the data was used for model development, including feature selection and algorithm training, while the remaining 20% was used for validation to assess the model's performance.\n\nTo ensure the independence of the training and test sets, the data was divided using a structured approach. This involved using SQL for data extraction and ensuring that the splits were made in a way that maintained the integrity and independence of the datasets. The development queue was further divided using ten-fold cross-validation, which helps in assessing the model's performance more robustly by training and validating on different subsets of the data.\n\nThe distribution of the dataset compares favorably with previously published machine learning datasets in the medical field. The use of a large, publicly available database like MIMIC-IV ensures that the data is comprehensive and representative of real-world ICU admissions. This includes a variety of vital signs, medications, laboratory test results, comorbidities, imaging reports, and survival data, providing a rich source of information for developing predictive models.\n\nThe study also implemented strict criteria for patient inclusion and exclusion, ensuring that the dataset was focused on patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) in the ICU. This focus helps in creating a more targeted and relevant dataset for the specific research question, enhancing the reliability and applicability of the findings.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data used in this study is publicly available through the MIMIC-IV (version 1.0) critical care database. This database includes a wide range of health-related data on patients admitted to the ICU at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center from 2008 to 2019. The data encompasses vital signs, medications, laboratory test results, comorbid diagnoses, imaging reports, and survival data.\n\nAccess to the MIMIC-IV database is granted to researchers who comply with the data user requirements and obtain approval from the Institutional Review Boards of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The data extraction process was carried out using Structured Query Language (SQL). The study population was split into development and validation queues with an 8:2 ratio.\n\nTo ensure the integrity and ethical use of the data, access was granted through a protection of human research participants assessment. This assessment is crucial for maintaining the confidentiality and security of patient information. Researchers must adhere to the data user requirements and obtain the necessary certifications to access the database. This enforcement mechanism ensures that the data is used responsibly and ethically, protecting the privacy of the patients whose information is included in the database.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithms used in this study are well-established and widely recognized in the field. These include K-nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine (SVM) with both linear and radial basis function (rbf) kernels, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayesian, XGBoost, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. These algorithms are part of the supervised learning paradigm, which is commonly used for classification and regression tasks.\n\nThe algorithms employed are not new; they have been extensively studied and applied in various domains, including medical research. The choice of these algorithms was driven by their proven effectiveness in handling complex datasets and their ability to provide robust performance metrics, such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC).\n\nThe decision to use these established algorithms rather than novel ones was influenced by the need for reliability and comparability in the medical field. These algorithms have been validated through numerous studies and are known for their stability and accuracy in predictive modeling. Publishing in a machine-learning journal was not a priority because the focus of this study was on applying these algorithms to a specific medical problem\u2014predicting in-hospital mortality among patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) in the intensive care unit (ICU). The primary goal was to leverage the strengths of these algorithms to develop a practical and effective prediction model, rather than introducing new machine-learning techniques.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it employs a variety of machine learning algorithms to build and evaluate prediction models. The algorithms used include K-nearest neighbors (KNN), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), naive Bayesian (NB), decision tree, support vector machine (SVM) with both linear and radial basis function (rbf) kernels, random forest (RF), and logistic regression (LR). These algorithms were applied to a dataset derived from the MIMIC-IV critical care database, focusing on patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) in the ICU.\n\nThe development of the model involved splitting the data into development and validation sets, with an 8:2 ratio. The development set was used to build the model and select features, while the validation set was used to confirm the model's discrimination and calibration. Feature selection was performed using a combination of feature ranking and stepwise integration. The data were normalized and fed into the aforementioned machine learning algorithms.\n\nThe performance of the models was evaluated using metrics such as ROC-AUC values, accuracy, precision, and F1 score. The random forest algorithm demonstrated the highest average AUC value in ten-fold cross-validation, indicating its effectiveness in predicting in-hospital mortality among the studied patient population. The final model was built using the top 11 features identified through the feature ranking process.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data used in this study was sourced from the MIMIC-IV database, which includes a wide range of health-related information such as vital signs, medications, laboratory test results, comorbidities, imaging reports, and survival data. To prepare this data for machine learning algorithms, several preprocessing steps were undertaken.\n\nFirst, patient records were extracted based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients aged 18 or older who met the KDIGO diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury (AKI) and the Sepsis-3 criteria for sepsis were included. Those with chronic kidney disease stage 5 or a follow-up time of less than 48 hours were excluded.\n\nData extraction was performed using PostgreSQL 13 software, focusing on information collected within 24 hours of a patient's admission. This included basic data, vital signs, laboratory test indicators, condition score scales, and survival data. Comorbidities were identified using International Classification of Diseases diagnosis codes.\n\nTo handle missing data, variables with more than 25% missing values were excluded to minimize bias. For normally distributed continuous variables, the mean and standard deviation were used, while for non-normally distributed variables, the median and interquartile range were employed. Categorical variables were expressed as percentages.\n\nThe data was then normalized to ensure consistency across different features. This preprocessing step is crucial for machine learning algorithms to perform effectively, as it standardizes the input data, making it easier for the algorithms to learn patterns and relationships.\n\nThe final dataset was split into development and validation queues in an 8:2 ratio. This split was used to train and evaluate the performance of the machine learning models. The development queue was further divided using ten-fold cross-validation to assess the models' robustness and generalizability.\n\nSeven machine learning algorithms were employed: K-nearest neighbors, extreme gradient boosting, naive Bayesian, decision tree, support vector machine (both linear and radial basis function kernels), random forest, and logistic regression. Each algorithm was trained on the preprocessed data, and their performance was evaluated using metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC), accuracy, precision, and F1 score.\n\nIn summary, the data encoding and preprocessing involved careful selection and extraction of relevant variables, handling of missing data, normalization, and splitting the dataset for training and validation. These steps ensured that the machine learning algorithms could effectively learn from the data and provide reliable predictions.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized 11 input parameters for our model. These parameters were selected through a rigorous process of ensemble stepwise feature ranking and selection. Initially, we started with 51 potential factors. To identify the most relevant features, we employed a method that involved splitting the dataset into multiple halves and constructing feature rankers using cross-validation. This process allowed us to rank features based on their significance. We iteratively added the best features to the model, evaluating their performance using logistic regression as the predictor. The final set of 11 features was chosen based on their ability to achieve the best prediction performance. These selected features included the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, temperature, blood sodium level, absolute lymphocyte count, respiratory rate, Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II) score, urine output, creatinine level, Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) stage, and body mass index (BMI). This systematic approach ensured that only the most predictive variables were included in our model.",
  "optimization/features": "The input features for the model were initially extracted from patient data, resulting in 51 features. These features included demographic information, routine vital signs, laboratory values, scores, comorbidities, and medications. To reduce the influence of noise and irrelevant variables, ensemble stepwise feature ranking and selection was performed. This process involved using multiple predictors and bagging to rank features based on their importance, calculated using the average information gain (Gini index). The final model utilized the top 11 features, which were selected based on their predictive performance. These features included the GCS score, age, temperature, blood sodium level, absolute lymphocyte count, respiratory rate, SAPS II score, urine output, creatinine level, AKI stage, and body mass index (BMI). Feature selection was conducted using the development set, ensuring that the training set remained independent for model evaluation.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed several strategies to address potential overfitting and underfitting issues. The number of features initially considered was indeed large, which could have led to overfitting if not properly managed. To mitigate this risk, we utilized ensemble stepwise feature ranking and selection. This method involved ranking features based on their importance using Random Forests, which calculates the importance of variables by averaging the information gain (Gini index). This approach helped in identifying the most relevant features and reducing the dimensionality of the dataset, thereby minimizing the risk of overfitting.\n\nWe further employed cross-validation techniques, specifically 10-fold cross-validation, to ensure the robustness of our models. This process involved dividing the dataset into 10 subsets, training the model on 9 subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This procedure was repeated 10 times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. The average performance of the predictors was then calculated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the ROC curves (ROC-AUC) as measurements. This method helped in assessing the generalizability of the models and ruling out overfitting.\n\nTo address underfitting, we used multiple machine learning algorithms, including K-nearest neighbors (KNN), extreme gradient boosting, naive Bayesian (NB), decision tree, support vector machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and logistic regression (LR). By comparing the performance metrics such as ROC-AUC values, accuracy, precision, and F1 score across these algorithms, we were able to select the best-performing models. Additionally, we ensured that the models were complex enough to capture the underlying patterns in the data by tuning hyperparameters and using ensemble methods.\n\nIn summary, we managed the risk of overfitting through feature selection and cross-validation, while ensuring that the models were not underfitting by using a variety of machine learning algorithms and tuning hyperparameters. These strategies collectively contributed to the development of robust and generalizable predictive models.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and enhance the generalizability of our models. Traditional regression analysis methods, which simultaneously rank, select, and do not control the number of variables, can lead to overfitting. To mitigate this, we utilized ensemble feature selection, which has been shown to avoid overfitting more effectively than methods like Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) or single machine learning algorithms.\n\nOur approach involved creating multiple feature rankers using cross-validation and then combining these rankers to obtain an ensemble feature ranking. This process helped in selecting the most significant features iteratively, ensuring that the final feature set was robust and not overly complex. By doing so, we were able to construct models that performed well without being too intricate for clinical utilization.\n\nAdditionally, we used ten-fold cross-validation to calculate the average performance of predictors with top features. This technique helped in assessing the model's performance more reliably and in preventing overfitting by ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the ROC curves (ROC-AUC) were used as measurements to evaluate the performance of our models.\n\nWe also implemented various machine learning algorithms, including K-nearest neighbors (KNN), extreme gradient boosting, naive Bayesian (NB), decision tree, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and logistic regression (LR). Each of these algorithms has its own regularization parameters and techniques to prevent overfitting. For instance, logistic regression with L2 regularization was used to penalize large coefficients, thereby reducing the model's complexity and preventing overfitting.\n\nIn summary, our study incorporated ensemble feature selection, cross-validation, and regularization techniques within various machine learning algorithms to effectively prevent overfitting and improve the generalizability of our predictive models.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations for the various machine learning algorithms used in our study are explicitly detailed. For instance, the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm was configured with `n_neighbors = 3`. The naive Bayesian (NB) algorithm was set with `priors = None`. The decision tree classifier was configured with parameters such as `criterion=\"gini\"`, `splitter=\"best\"`, and `max_depth = None`. The support vector machine (SVM) was implemented with both linear and radial basis function (rbf) kernels, with `probability = True` for both. The random forest classifier was set with `n_estimators = 100` and `random_state = 0`. The logistic regression model was configured with `penalty=\"l2\"`, `solver=\"lbfgs\"`, and `max_iter = 100`.\n\nThe optimization schedule involved using ten-fold cross-validation to calculate the average performance of predictors with top features. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the ROC curves (ROC-AUC) were used as measurements to evaluate the performance of the models. The Delong test was utilized for AUC comparison.\n\nModel files and optimization parameters are not explicitly mentioned as being available for download. However, the statistical analysis, modeling, and validation were implemented using Python version 3.8, and the specific module packages used are referenced. The code and data used in this study are not explicitly stated to be available under a specific license, but the methods and configurations are thoroughly documented to ensure reproducibility.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in this study leverages machine learning techniques, specifically the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, which has traditionally been considered a 'black box' due to its complexity and the difficulty in interpreting how it makes predictions. However, to enhance the interpretability of the RF model, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) were employed. SHAP values provide a way to attribute the output of the model to the input features, making it possible to understand the contribution of each variable to the prediction.\n\nSHAP values offer a clear and intuitive way to interpret the model's decisions. For instance, a positive SHAP value for a variable indicates that it increases the likelihood of the predicted outcome, while a negative SHAP value suggests the opposite. This allows clinicians to see not only which factors are important but also how they influence the prediction. For example, a higher Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score might have a negative SHAP value, indicating it reduces the risk of in-hospital mortality, whereas a higher Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II) might have a positive SHAP value, indicating it increases the risk.\n\nAdditionally, SHAP summary plots and dependence plots were used to visualize the relationship between features and their impact on the model's predictions. These plots help in understanding how different variables interact and affect the outcome. For example, the SHAP summary plot can show the overall importance of each feature and how it contributes to the prediction across all samples. The SHAP dependence plot can illustrate how the effect of a particular feature changes with its value, providing deeper insights into the model's behavior.\n\nFurthermore, SHAP force plots were generated to demonstrate how the model personalizes the prediction for each patient. These plots show the contribution of each feature to the final prediction, making it easier to understand the model's decision-making process for individual cases. For instance, in a high-risk patient, the force plot might show that a combination of high SAPS II score, low GCS score, and other critical factors significantly increases the predicted risk of mortality.\n\nIn summary, while the RF model itself is complex, the use of SHAP values and associated visualizations makes the model more transparent and interpretable. This transparency is crucial for clinical decision-making, as it allows healthcare providers to understand the rationale behind the model's predictions and to trust the recommendations it provides.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a classification model. It is designed to predict the likelihood of mortality in patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI). The primary output of the model is a binary classification indicating whether a patient is at high or low risk of mortality.\n\nThe performance of the model was evaluated using several metrics, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, precision, and F1 score. These metrics were used to compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms, with the best-performing model selected for final predictions.\n\nThe model's predictions are explained using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), which provide insights into how each variable contributes to the prediction of mortality. The SHAP summary plot and dependence plot help to understand the impact of different variables on the prognosis of SA-AKI patients. Additionally, the SHAP force plot personalizes the prediction for each patient, aiding in clinical decision-making.\n\nThe model was validated internally, and the results indicate that it can effectively stratify patients based on their risk of mortality. This information can be crucial for clinicians in managing and treating patients with SA-AKI, potentially improving outcomes through more targeted and timely interventions.",
  "model/duration": "To expedite the computation process, logistic regression was employed as the predictor. This choice was made to enhance the efficiency of the model training and validation phases. The development queues were utilized to confirm the algorithm's performance through ten-fold cross-validation. This process involved calculating the average ROC-AUC across the ten folds and plotting the ROC curve. The test set was then used to validate the model's discrimination and calibration, while the development queues were instrumental in model building and feature selection. Features were filtered using a stepwise integration of feature selection and feature ranking. The data underwent normalization before being fed into seven different machine learning algorithms, including K-nearest neighbors, extreme gradient boosting, naive Bayesian, decision tree, support vector machine (both linear and rbf kernels), random forest, and logistic regression. The performance of these models was evaluated using metrics such as ROC-AUC values, accuracy, precision, and F1 score. The Delong test was applied for AUC comparison. The statistical analysis, modeling, and validation were conducted using Python version 3.8, with various module packages. For normally distributed variables, continuous variables were expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation, while non-normally distributed variables were expressed as the median (interquartile range). Categorical variables were presented as percentages. Univariate analyses involved comparing categorical variables using Pearson\u2019s chi-squared or Fisher\u2019s exact tests and continuous variables using Student\u2019s t-tests or the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test, with p-values <0.05 considered statistically significant. The area under the ROC curve (AUC), accuracy, precision, and F1 score were used in the internal validation to compare the performance of the models constructed by the seven machine learning algorithms. The model with the best performance was selected as the final prediction model. Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) were used to interpret the results of the best prediction model. The SHAP summary plot and SHAP dependence plot of the final prediction model were generated to understand how each variable influenced the prognosis of SA-AKI patients during hospitalization. The SHAP force plot for patients was created to illustrate how the model personalized the prediction of each patient\u2019s condition, aiding in clinical decision-making.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method employed in this study involved a rigorous process to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the models. Ten-fold cross-validation was utilized to assess the performance of the algorithms. This technique involves dividing the development dataset into ten segments, where nine segments are used for training and one segment is used for validation. This process is repeated ten times, with each segment serving as the validation set once. The average performance across these ten iterations is then calculated to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's predictive capabilities.\n\nTo measure performance, several metrics were used, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC), accuracy, precision, and F1 score. These metrics offer a multifaceted view of the model's effectiveness, ensuring that both the true positive rate and false positive rate are considered. The ROC-AUC, in particular, is a critical metric as it summarizes the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes across all threshold levels.\n\nIn addition to cross-validation, the study also involved internal validation using the test set. This set was used to confirm the discrimination and calibration of the model, providing an independent assessment of its performance. The features selected for the model were filtered through a stepwise integration of feature selection and feature ranking, ensuring that only the most relevant features were included.\n\nSeven different machine learning algorithms were evaluated: K-nearest neighbors (KNN), extreme gradient boosting, naive Bayesian (NB), decision tree, support vector machine (SVM) with both linear and radial basis function (RBF) kernels, random forest (RF), and logistic regression (LR). Each algorithm was assessed using the aforementioned metrics, and the Delong test was used for AUC comparison to determine the best-performing model.\n\nThe final prediction model was chosen based on its superior performance in terms of ROC-AUC, accuracy, precision, and F1 score. Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) were then used to interpret the results of the best prediction model. SHAP values help in understanding the contribution of each variable to the model's predictions, providing insights into how different features influence the outcome. SHAP summary plots, dependence plots, and force plots were generated to visualize these contributions, aiding in the interpretation of the model's predictions and guiding clinical decision-making.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the \"Performance Measures\" subsection, we report several key metrics to evaluate the performance of our machine learning models. The primary metric used is the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC), which provides a comprehensive measure of the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes. This metric is particularly useful for imbalanced datasets, which are common in medical research.\n\nIn addition to ROC-AUC, we also report accuracy, precision, and the F1 score. Accuracy measures the proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined. Precision indicates the proportion of true positive results among all positive results predicted by the model. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both concerns. These metrics together offer a robust evaluation of model performance across different aspects.\n\nTo ensure the reliability of our results, we employ ten-fold cross-validation. This technique involves dividing the dataset into ten subsets, training the model on nine subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated ten times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. The average performance metrics across these ten iterations are then calculated to provide a more stable and generalizable estimate of model performance.\n\nThe use of these metrics is consistent with established practices in the literature, ensuring that our evaluation is representative and comparable to other studies in the field. The Delong test is used for comparing AUC values, which is a standard method for assessing the statistical significance of differences in ROC-AUC between models. This comprehensive approach to performance evaluation ensures that our models are thoroughly vetted and reliable for predicting outcomes in our study.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In the \"Methods Comparison\" subsection, we evaluated the performance of various machine learning algorithms to determine the best predictors for our model. We employed seven different algorithms: K-nearest neighbors (KNN), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), naive Bayesian (NB), decision tree, support vector machine (SVM) with both linear and radial basis function (rbf) kernels, random forest (RF), and logistic regression (LR). These algorithms were chosen to provide a comprehensive comparison across different types of machine learning techniques.\n\nTo ensure a robust evaluation, we used ten-fold cross-validation on the development set. This method involved splitting the data into ten segments, training the model on nine segments, and validating it on the remaining segment. This process was repeated ten times, with each segment serving as the validation set once. The average performance of the predictors was then calculated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC-AUC).\n\nThe results of this comparison are summarized in a table that lists the average ROC-AUC values and their standard deviations for each algorithm. The random forest algorithm demonstrated the highest average ROC-AUC of 0.82, followed closely by XGBoost with an average ROC-AUC of 0.81. Logistic regression and naive Bayesian also performed well, with average ROC-AUC values of 0.79 and 0.78, respectively. The SVM with an rbf kernel had an average ROC-AUC of 0.76, while the linear SVM and KNN had lower performances, with average ROC-AUC values of 0.69 and 0.64, respectively. The decision tree algorithm had the lowest average ROC-AUC of 0.64.\n\nThese comparisons allowed us to identify the most effective algorithms for our predictive model, ensuring that we selected the best-performing methods for further analysis and validation. The use of multiple algorithms and cross-validation techniques provided a thorough evaluation, enhancing the reliability and generalizability of our findings.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our models involved a rigorous process to ensure the confidence in our results. We employed ten-fold cross-validation to assess the performance of our algorithms, which helps in providing a more robust estimate of model performance by reducing the risk of overfitting.\n\nFor statistical significance, we used the Delong test to compare the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) values. This test is specifically designed for comparing the AUCs of two correlated ROC curves, which is crucial for determining if the differences in performance between models are statistically significant.\n\nIn our analysis, we reported the average ROC-AUC values, accuracy, precision, and F1 scores for the seven machine learning algorithms we evaluated. These metrics were chosen because they provide a comprehensive view of model performance across different aspects, such as the trade-off between true positive and false positive rates (ROC-AUC), the overall correctness (accuracy), the precision of positive predictions (precision), and the harmonic mean of precision and recall (F1 score).\n\nWe also ensured that our results were statistically significant by setting a p-value threshold of less than 0.05. This threshold is a standard in the field and helps in claiming that the observed differences in performance are unlikely to have occurred by chance.\n\nAdditionally, we used Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) to interpret the results of our best-performing model. SHAP values provide a way to understand the contribution of each feature to the model's predictions, which adds another layer of confidence in our findings by making the model more interpretable.\n\nIn summary, our evaluation process included robust statistical methods and comprehensive performance metrics, ensuring that our claims of model superiority are well-supported and statistically significant.",
