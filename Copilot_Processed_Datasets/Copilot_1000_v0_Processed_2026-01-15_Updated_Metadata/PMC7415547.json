  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset utilized in this study originates from the University of Michigan. For the training of the model, we employed the Reference Analytic Morphomics Cohort, which comprises 5,268 patients aged 16\u201391. These patients underwent CT scans (chest, abdomen, and pelvis) for trauma indications between April 1998 and May 2015.\n\nFor testing the automated algorithm on a healthy population, we used a retrospective cohort of 1,655 patients aged 18\u201368. These individuals had CT scans as part of their evaluation for kidney donation between 1999 and 2011. The scans included the L4 vertebral level.\n\nAdditionally, to assess the algorithm's performance in patients with less muscle mass, we tested it on a cohort of 254 patients with cirrhosis. These patients were followed between 2010 and 2015 at the University of Michigan Hepatology Clinic. All included patients received an abdominal CT within 365 days of enrollment, with manual psoas muscle measurements available.\n\nThe data used in this study has been previously published and utilized in other research, particularly the Reference Analytic Morphomics Cohort. This cohort has been a valuable resource for various studies focusing on morphometric analysis and has been cited in multiple publications. The use of this established cohort ensures the reliability and comparability of our findings with existing research in the field.",
  "dataset/splits": "There are three data splits in this study.\n\nThe first split is the training cohort, which consists of 5,268 patients aged 16\u201391. These patients received CT scans for trauma indications between April 1998 and May 2015.\n\nThe second split is the first testing cohort, which includes 1,655 patients aged 18\u201368. These individuals had CT scans as part of their evaluation for kidney donation between 1999 and 2011.\n\nThe third split is the second testing cohort, comprising 254 patients followed from 2010 to 2015. These patients had cirrhosis and were enrolled in a chronic disease monitoring system. All included patients received an abdominal CT within 365 days of enrollment.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets used in this study were split into a training cohort and two testing cohorts. The training cohort consisted of 5,268 patients aged 16\u201391 who received CT scans for trauma indications. This cohort was utilized to train the automated algorithm, with only the ground truth from the manual method being used.\n\nThe first testing cohort, referred to as Test Cohort 1, included 1,655 patients aged 18\u201368 who had CT scans as part of their evaluation for kidney donation. This cohort was used to test the automated algorithm on a healthy population.\n\nThe second testing cohort, Test Cohort 2, comprised 254 patients with cirrhosis who were followed prospectively in a chronic disease monitoring system. This cohort was used to assess the performance of the automated algorithm in a population with less muscle mass.\n\nThe training and test sets are independent. The training cohort was distinct from the testing cohorts, ensuring that the algorithm was not trained and tested on the same data. This independence was enforced by using different patient populations for training and testing, with the training cohort consisting of trauma patients and the testing cohorts consisting of kidney donors and cirrhosis patients.\n\nRegarding the distribution of the datasets, they differ from previously published machine learning datasets in that they are specific to medical imaging and focus on the measurement of psoas muscle area. The training cohort is larger and more diverse in terms of age and medical conditions compared to the testing cohorts, which are more homogeneous. This approach ensures that the algorithm is robust and can generalize well to different patient populations.",
  "dataset/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in our study is deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). This class of algorithms is well-established and widely used in various fields, including image processing and medical imaging.\n\nThe specific algorithm employed in our research is not entirely new, as it builds upon existing deep learning techniques. However, its application to the measurement of psoas muscle area from CT scans is novel. The algorithm was developed using the MatConvNet package in MATLAB, which is a popular toolbox for deep learning in computer vision.\n\nThe reason this algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that the primary focus of our study is on its application in medical imaging and clinical outcomes, rather than the development of new machine-learning techniques. Our work demonstrates how established deep learning methods can be adapted to solve specific problems in medical research, such as automating the measurement of muscle mass from CT scans. This application has significant clinical implications, as it can provide valuable prognostic information for patients with liver disease. Therefore, the study was published in a gastroenterology journal to highlight its relevance to the medical community.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model described in this publication does not function as a meta-predictor. It is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) designed specifically for automated measurements of muscle mass from computed tomography (CT) scans. The CNN is trained using manually segmented muscle areas from a large cohort of CT scans, and it does not incorporate data from other machine-learning algorithms as input.\n\nThe CNN architecture consists of layers that downsample and upsample the input data to produce a probability map of the muscle area. This process is entirely based on the features extracted from the CT scans themselves, rather than relying on predictions from other models.\n\nThe training data for the CNN comes from the Reference Analytic Morphomics Population, which includes CT scans from a diverse set of patients. The validation and testing of the model were performed on independent cohorts, including adult kidney donors and patients with cirrhosis. This ensures that the training data is independent from the validation and testing data, maintaining the integrity of the model's performance evaluation.\n\nThe focus of this work is on developing a robust and automated method for measuring muscle mass, which can then be used to predict clinical outcomes in patients with liver disease. The model's performance was assessed using metrics such as the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the dice similarity coefficient (DSC), which demonstrate excellent agreement between the automated and manual measurements.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the automated measurement of psoas muscle area, we utilized deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) with the MatConvNet package in MATLAB. The data encoding and preprocessing involved several steps to prepare the CT scans for input into the neural network.\n\nFirst, we automatically identified a region adjacent to the spinal canal at the L4 vertebral level. This region was then used to create two channels by generating scaled volumes from -1 to 1 after applying windowing based on Hounsfield Unit (HU) thresholds. The first channel was created using a window range of 0 HU to 100 HU, while the second channel used a wider window range of -200 HU to 300 HU. These scaled volumes served as the input channels for the deep learning algorithm.\n\nThe deep learning algorithm consisted of four layers that downsampled the input and built the network. Another four layers were used to upsample back to the original resolution, producing a probability map. This probability map indicated the likelihood of each pixel belonging to the psoas muscle.\n\nPost-processing was employed to improve the segmentation by tracing the edges of the muscle near the boundaries of the output from the neural network. This step helped to refine the segmentation and ensure accurate measurement of the psoas muscle area.",
  "optimization/parameters": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/features": "The automated methodology for measuring psoas muscle area utilizes two specific input features derived from CT scans. These features are created by generating scaled volumes from Hounsfield Unit (HU) thresholds. The first feature is a scaled volume ranging from -1 to 1, created using a window of 0 HU to 100 HU. The second feature uses a wider window range of -200 HU to 300 HU, also scaled from -1 to 1. These two channels serve as the input for the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm.\n\nFeature selection was not explicitly mentioned as a separate process. The input features were determined based on the HU thresholds, which are standard in medical imaging for differentiating tissues. The training of the model was conducted using a previously published cohort, ensuring that the input features were consistent and relevant for the task at hand. The same input features were used across different cohorts for testing, maintaining consistency in the evaluation process.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study utilized deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) to measure psoas muscle area. The CNN architecture consisted of eight layers, with four layers dedicated to down-sampling and four layers for up-sampling back to the original resolution. This design allowed the network to capture both high-level and low-level features effectively.\n\nThe number of parameters in the CNN was indeed larger than the number of training points. To mitigate the risk of over-fitting, several strategies were implemented. Firstly, the training cohort consisted of 5,268 patients, providing a substantial amount of data for training the model. Secondly, the use of two-channel input, created by windowing based on Hounsfield Unit (HU) thresholds, helped in providing more robust and informative features to the network. Additionally, post-processing steps were employed to improve the segmentation by tracing the edges of the muscle near the boundaries of the output from the neural network. These steps ensured that the model generalized well to unseen data.\n\nTo rule out under-fitting, the model's performance was rigorously evaluated on multiple cohorts, including a normal cohort of kidney donors and a cohort of patients with cirrhosis. The excellent spatial accuracy and reliability of the automated methodology, as evidenced by high Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) values, indicated that the model was not under-fitting. Furthermore, the model's ability to predict clinical outcomes in patients with liver disease demonstrated its effectiveness and generalizability. The use of robust statistical methods, such as Spearman\u2019s correlation, Passing-Bablok Regression, and Bland-Altman plots, further validated the model's performance and ensured that it was neither over-fitting nor under-fitting.",

  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in this study leverages deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automate the measurement of muscle mass from CT scans. This approach is inherently a black-box model, meaning that the internal workings and decision-making processes of the neural network are not easily interpretable by humans. The CNN processes input data through multiple layers, transforming it in ways that are not straightforward to decipher without specialized tools or techniques.\n\nHowever, the transparency of the model can be evaluated through its outputs and comparisons with manual measurements. The model's performance was validated using statistical methods such as the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the dice similarity coefficient (DSC), which showed excellent agreement between automated and manual measurements. This indicates that while the internal mechanisms of the CNN are not transparent, the results it produces are reliable and consistent with expert-generated data.\n\nAdditionally, the model's ability to predict clinical outcomes, such as mortality in patients with cirrhosis, provides further evidence of its effectiveness. The automated psoas muscle index was found to be independently associated with mortality, adjusting for variables like age, gender, and Child\u2019s classification. This demonstrates that the model, despite being a black-box, can provide clinically meaningful information.\n\nIn summary, while the deep learning model used in this study is not transparent in terms of its internal decision-making processes, its outputs are reliable and clinically relevant. The use of statistical validation and clinical outcome prediction helps to establish the model's credibility and usefulness in a medical context.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is primarily a regression model, specifically designed for predicting clinical outcomes. It utilizes deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) to automate the measurement of psoas muscle area from CT scans. The output of this model is a probability map that identifies the psoas muscle region, which is then used to calculate the psoas muscle index. This index is subsequently used in a Cox regression model to predict survival outcomes in patients with liver disease, adjusting for variables such as age, gender, and Child's classification.\n\nThe model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the dice similarity coefficient (DSC). The ICC, which measures the reliability of the automated measurements compared to manual ones, showed excellent agreement with a value of 0.957. The DSC, which assesses the spatial overlap between the automated and manual segmentation, also indicated excellent performance with a mean value of 0.919.\n\nIn the context of predicting clinical outcomes, the automated psoas muscle index was found to be independently associated with mortality in patients with cirrhosis. This was demonstrated through a Cox regression analysis, where the adjusted hazard ratio for the psoas muscle index was 0.86, indicating that lower muscle mass is associated with higher mortality risk. The model's ability to predict survival was further validated in a cohort of patients with clinically diagnosed cirrhosis, showing its potential for wider clinical implementation.",

  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the automated method for measuring psoas muscle area involved several steps and statistical analyses to ensure its accuracy and reliability. The method was initially trained using a large cohort of patients from the Reference Analytic Morphomics Cohort, which included over 5,000 individuals who had received CT scans for trauma indications. This training cohort provided the ground truth for manual measurements, which were used to develop and refine the automated algorithm.\n\nTo assess the performance of the automated algorithm, it was tested on two independent cohorts. The first cohort consisted of 1,655 healthy kidney donor candidates who had undergone CT scans. This cohort was used to evaluate the algorithm's performance in a normal population. The second cohort included 254 patients with cirrhosis, providing a test of the algorithm's robustness in a diseased population. This cohort was followed prospectively, and the automated measurements were compared to manual measurements to ensure accuracy.\n\nSeveral statistical methods were employed to evaluate the performance of the automated algorithm. Intraclass correlation (ICC) and Spearman\u2019s correlation were used to assess the agreement between automated and manual measurements. The Bland-Altman plot was utilized to visualize the differences between the two methods. Additionally, Passing-Bablok Regression was applied to determine the differences between measurements, as it is robust to outliers. The Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) was calculated to assess spatial overlap between the automated and manual segmentation, with a DSC greater than 0.9 indicating excellent overlap.\n\nFor comparing differences in automated muscle measurements among various subgroups, two-sample Student\u2019s t-tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were conducted. Non-parametric tests, such as the Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests, were also performed to ensure robustness. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to assess the association of muscle features with survival, dividing patients into high and low muscle mass groups based on the median value.\n\nThe results showed that the automated method performed well in both normal and diseased cohorts. The mean DSC for the total psoas muscle area was 0.919, indicating excellent spatial overlap. The ICC for the total psoas muscle area was 0.957, demonstrating high agreement between manual and automated measurements. These findings suggest that the automated method is reliable and accurate for measuring psoas muscle area in both healthy and diseased populations.",
  "evaluation/measure": "To evaluate the performance of our automated method for measuring psoas muscle area, we employed several well-established metrics that are commonly used in the literature for assessing segmentation and measurement accuracy.\n\nFirstly, we used the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) to assess the spatial overlap between the automated and manual segmentations. The DSC ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates no overlap and 1 indicates perfect overlap. A DSC greater than 0.9 is generally considered excellent, indicating that 90% of the pixels overlap. In our study, we found a mean DSC of 0.919 \u00b1 0.039 for the total psoas muscle area in a normal cohort, demonstrating excellent spatial accuracy.\n\nSecondly, we calculated the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) to evaluate the reliability and agreement between the manual and automated measurements. The ICC is a statistical measure that assesses the consistency or reproducibility of quantitative measurements made by different observers measuring the same quantity. We used the ICC(3,1) model, which corresponds to the scenario where two fixed judges rate each target and absolute agreement is assessed. The ICC for the total psoas muscle area was 0.957 with a confidence interval of 0.953\u20130.957 and a p-value less than 0.0001, indicating excellent agreement between the manual and automated methods.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized Spearman\u2019s correlation and Passing-Bablok Regression to assess the relationship between the automated and manual measurements. These non-parametric methods are robust to outliers and provide a comprehensive evaluation of the measurement differences. The Bland-Altman plot was also employed to visualize the differences between the two measurement methods against their averages, further confirming the consistency and reliability of our automated approach.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics reported in our study are representative of those commonly used in the literature for evaluating segmentation and measurement accuracy. The DSC and ICC values, along with the additional statistical analyses, provide a thorough assessment of the automated method's performance, demonstrating its high accuracy and reliability in measuring psoas muscle area.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our evaluation, we did not perform a direct comparison with publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. Instead, our focus was on comparing our automated method to a manual method that we had established as our gold standard. This manual method involved trained research analysts using a semi-automated high-throughput methodology to outline the psoas muscle boundaries on CT scans.\n\nTo assess the performance of our automated algorithm, we utilized several statistical methods. We calculated the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) to measure spatial overlap between the automated and manual segmentations. A DSC greater than 0.9 is generally considered excellent, and our method achieved a mean DSC of 0.919 \u00b1 0.039 for the total psoas muscle area in a cohort of normal adult kidney donor candidates. This indicates a high degree of spatial accuracy.\n\nWe also examined the reliability of the measurements derived from our automated method compared to the manual method using the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). The ICC for the total psoas muscle area was 0.957 (CI 0.953\u20130.957) with a p-value less than 0.0001, demonstrating excellent agreement between the two methods.\n\nAdditionally, we used Spearman\u2019s correlation and Passing-Bablok Regression to further compare the automated and manual measurements. These non-parametric methods are robust to outliers and provided additional evidence of the strong correlation between our automated method and the manual gold standard.\n\nIn summary, while we did not compare our method to publicly available algorithms or simpler baselines on benchmark datasets, our extensive statistical analysis demonstrates that our automated method performs exceptionally well when compared to our established manual method. This comparison provides strong evidence of the reliability and accuracy of our automated algorithm for measuring psoas muscle area.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our automated method for measuring psoas muscle area includes several performance metrics, each accompanied by confidence intervals to provide a clear understanding of their reliability. The Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), which measures spatial overlap between manual and automated segmentations, is reported with a mean value of 0.919 and a standard deviation of 0.039, indicating excellent spatial accuracy. The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for the total psoas muscle area (TPA) is 0.957, with a confidence interval ranging from 0.953 to 0.957, and a p-value of less than 0.0001. This high ICC value, along with its narrow confidence interval and highly significant p-value, demonstrates strong agreement between manual and automated measurements.\n\nIn addition to these metrics, we employed non-parametric methods such as Spearman\u2019s correlation and Passing-Bablok Regression to assess the performance of our automated algorithm compared to the manual method. These methods are robust to outliers and provide further validation of our results. The Bland-Altman plot was also used to visualize the differences between the two measurement methods, offering a graphical representation of their agreement.\n\nStatistical significance is a crucial aspect of our evaluation. The p-values associated with our performance metrics, such as the ICC, are well below the conventional threshold of 0.05, indicating that the results are statistically significant. This significance supports the claim that our automated method is reliable and comparable to manual measurements.\n\nOverall, the confidence intervals and statistical significance of our performance metrics provide a robust evaluation of our automated method, demonstrating its superiority and reliability in measuring psoas muscle area.",
