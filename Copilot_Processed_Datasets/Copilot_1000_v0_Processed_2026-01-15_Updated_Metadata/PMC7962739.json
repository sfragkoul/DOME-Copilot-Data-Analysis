  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was derived from health check-up reports of subjects who underwent abdominal ultrasonography. The total number of subjects enrolled in the study was 14,792. These subjects were randomly divided into a training group consisting of 10,354 subjects and a testing group consisting of 4,438 subjects. The training group was further split into a subset for training the network and another subset for cross-validation, ensuring that the model was not overtrained.\n\nThe dataset included a variety of biochemical and clinical variables, such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), uric acid, triglycerides (TG), and fasting plasma glucose (FPG). These variables were selected through a stepwise elimination process based on their significance in predicting fatty liver disease (FLD).\n\nThe dataset was analyzed using Python with libraries such as scipy and sklearn. The variables were normalized, and output values ranged from 0 (FLD absent) to 1 (FLD present). The relationship between variables and FLD diagnosis was explored through univariate analysis using the Wald test and confirmed by multivariate analysis through principal-component analysis. Variables that showed no statistically significant relationship were excluded, while the remaining ones were used as potential input nodes to build the artificial neural network (ANN).\n\nThe performance of the ANN model was evaluated using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, with the area under the ROC curve (AUROC) serving as a major indicator of the model\u2019s diagnostic performance. Other evaluation indicators, including overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value, were also calculated for different cut-off points of outputs. The best cut-off point was determined by Youden\u2019s Index.\n\nThe dataset and the methods used in this study build upon existing research and community knowledge in the field of FLD diagnosis, leveraging advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to improve diagnostic accuracy.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into two main splits: a training group and a testing group. The training group consisted of 10,354 subjects, which accounted for 70% of the total 14,792 subjects enrolled in the study. The testing group comprised 4,438 subjects, making up the remaining 30%.\n\nWithin the training group, a further split was made for model validation purposes. Specifically, 7,396 subjects (50% of the entire study group) were used to train the network, while the remaining 2,958 subjects (20% of the entire study group) were used for cross-validation. This cross-validation group was designed to prevent the network from being overtrained, ensuring that the model maintained general predictive characteristics rather than being tailored to specific cases.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset used in this study consisted of 14,792 subjects, which were randomly assigned to two groups: a training group and a testing group. The training group comprised 10,354 subjects, accounting for 70% of the total dataset, while the testing group included 4,438 subjects, making up the remaining 30%. This split was designed to ensure that the training group was used to build the artificial neural network (ANN) model, while the testing group was used to evaluate its diagnostic capability.\n\nTo prevent overfitting, the training group was further divided into two subsets. The first subset, consisting of 7,396 subjects (50% of the entire study group), was used to train the network. The second subset, comprising 2,958 subjects (20% of the entire study group), was used for cross-validation. This cross-validation group was essential for preventing the network from being overtrained, which could lead to deviation from the general predictive characteristics due to specific cases.\n\nThe independence of the training and testing sets was enforced through random assignment, ensuring that there was no overlap between the two groups. This random assignment helped to maintain the integrity of the evaluation process, as the testing group provided an unbiased assessment of the model's performance.\n\nThe distribution of the dataset compares favorably to previously published machine learning datasets in the context of fatty liver disease (FLD) diagnosis. The use of a large and diverse sample size, along with a rigorous splitting strategy, ensures that the model's performance is generalizable to new, unseen data. The random assignment and the use of a cross-validation subset further enhance the robustness of the model, making it a reliable tool for FLD diagnosis.",
  "dataset/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used is artificial neural networks (ANN). This class of algorithms is well-established and widely used for various predictive modeling tasks, including medical diagnosis.\n\nThe specific ANN algorithm employed is not new; it is a well-known approach in the field of machine learning. The back-propagation algorithm is utilized to train the network, which is a standard method for adjusting the weights between neurons to minimize the error in predictions.\n\nThe reason this algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that the focus of the study is on its application in the medical field, specifically for diagnosing fatty liver disease (FLD). The innovation lies in the application of the ANN to this particular medical problem, rather than in the development of a new machine-learning algorithm. The study aims to demonstrate the superior performance of ANNs in predicting FLD compared to other statistical models, such as the Fatty Liver Index (FLI) and the Hepatic Steatosis Index (HSI).",
  "optimization/meta": "Not applicable. The model described is an artificial neural network (ANN) designed specifically for predicting fatty liver disease (FLD). It does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. The ANN was developed using a set of eight variables derived from health check-up reports, including age, gender, body mass index, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, uric acid, total triglyceride, and fasting plasma glucose. These variables were selected through a stepwise elimination process based on their significance in predicting FLD. The model's performance was evaluated using various metrics, such as the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, and concordance with ultrasonography results. The training and testing groups were randomly assigned from a larger dataset, ensuring independence of the training data.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure the variables were suitable for input into the artificial neural network (ANN). Initially, all variables were normalized to ensure they were on a comparable scale. This normalization process was crucial for the ANN to function effectively, as it helps in preventing any single variable from dominating the learning process due to its scale.\n\nVariables with highly skewed distributions, such as ALT, AST, GGT, TBA, TG, FPG, VLDL, and EOS, were log-transformed to achieve a normal distribution. This transformation was necessary to reduce the impact of outliers and to make the data more suitable for statistical analysis.\n\nAfter normalization and transformation, the variables were then used as potential input nodes for the ANN. The selection of variables was done through a stepwise elimination process. This involved starting with a model that included all potential variables and then systematically removing one variable at a time to observe the impact on the model's performance, as measured by the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The variable whose removal resulted in the least change in AUROC was eliminated. This process was repeated until a statistically significant difference in AUROC was observed, indicating the optimal set of variables for the ANN model.\n\nThe final set of variables selected for the ANN input layer included age, gender, BMI, ALT, AST, uric acid, TG, and FPG. These variables were deemed to have a significant relationship with the diagnosis of fatty liver disease (FLD) through univariate and multivariate analyses. The relationship between these variables and FLD diagnosis was explored using the Wald test and confirmed through principal-component analysis. Variables that showed no statistically significant relationship were excluded from the model.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the final model utilized eight input parameters. These parameters were selected through a systematic process involving univariate and multivariate analyses. Initially, 29 variables were considered, and univariate analysis using the Wald test identified 27 variables significantly associated with fatty liver disease (FLD). Multivariate analysis through principal-component analysis confirmed these associations. Variables that did not show a statistically significant relationship were excluded. The remaining variables, along with age and gender, were candidates for stepwise elimination. This process involved iteratively removing one variable at a time and evaluating the model's performance using the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The procedure continued until a statistically significant difference in AUROC was observed, indicating the optimal set of input variables. Ultimately, the eight variables\u2014age, gender, body mass index (BMI), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), uric acid, triglycerides (TG), and fasting plasma glucose (FPG)\u2014were retained as the input nodes for the artificial neural network (ANN) model.",
  "optimization/features": "The input features for the artificial neural network (ANN) diagnostic model were carefully selected through a stepwise elimination process. Initially, 29 variables were considered, but univariate and multivariate analyses reduced this number to 27 significant variables. Additionally, age and gender were included as candidates for the input layer. Through a rigorous selection process, eight variables were ultimately chosen as the input nodes for the ANN model. These variables are age, gender, body mass index (BMI), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), uric acid, triglycerides (TG), and fasting plasma glucose (FPG).\n\nFeature selection was indeed performed to ensure that only the most relevant variables were included in the model. This process was conducted using the training set only, which consisted of 10,354 subjects. The selection involved removing one variable at a time and evaluating the model's performance using the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The variable whose removal resulted in the least change in AUROC was eliminated. This procedure was repeated until a statistically significant difference in AUROC was observed, indicating that the remaining variables were the most predictive of fatty liver disease (FLD).",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study involved a careful balance to ensure neither overfitting nor underfitting occurred. The artificial neural network (ANN) model was designed with a specific number of input variables, which were selected through a stepwise elimination process. This process involved starting with a comprehensive set of variables and iteratively removing those that did not significantly contribute to the model's performance, as measured by the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC).\n\nTo prevent overfitting, the dataset was divided into three groups: a training group, a validation group, and a testing group. The training group, comprising 70% of the total subjects, was used to build the ANN model. Within this group, 50% of the subjects were used for training the network, while the remaining 20% were used for cross-validation. This validation group was crucial in preventing the network from becoming overly tailored to specific cases, thereby ensuring that the model maintained general predictive characteristics.\n\nThe performance of the model was evaluated using the testing group, which consisted of 30% of the total subjects. This group was used to assess the diagnostic capability of the model without any influence from the training process. The AUROC, along with other evaluation indicators such as sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, was calculated to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability.\n\nAdditionally, the Brier score was calculated to measure the average squared deviation between predicted probabilities and actual outcomes, providing a quantitative measure of the model's accuracy. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test was also performed to evaluate the calibration of the model, ensuring that the predicted probabilities aligned well with the observed outcomes.\n\nIn summary, the fitting method involved a rigorous process of variable selection, cross-validation, and independent testing to ensure that the model was neither overfitted nor underfitted. The use of multiple evaluation metrics and statistical tests further validated the model's performance and reliability.",
  "optimization/regularization": "A validation group was designed to prevent the network from being overtrained. This means deviation from the general predictive characteristics due to specific cases was avoided. The training group was used to build the ANN model while the testing group was used to evaluate its diagnostic capability. The validation group was designed to prevent the network from being overtrained, which means deviation from the general predictive characteristics due to specific cases. The performance of our network was evaluated through a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The area under the ROC curve (AUROC) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated as a major indicator of the model\u2019s diagnostic performance in this binary classifier system.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in this study is an artificial neural network (ANN), which is generally considered a black-box model. This means that while the ANN can provide accurate predictions, the internal workings and the specific relationships between the input variables and the output are not easily interpretable. The ANN processes information through layers of interconnected nodes, each applying weights and biases to the input data, making it challenging to trace the exact path that leads to a particular prediction.\n\nHowever, the process of selecting the input variables for the ANN model was transparent and methodical. Initially, 29 variables were considered, and through univariate and multivariate analyses, 27 variables were found to be significantly associated with fatty liver disease (FLD). After a stepwise elimination process, eight variables\u2014age, gender, body mass index (BMI), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), uric acid, total triglyceride (TG), and fasting plasma glucose (FPG)\u2014were ultimately chosen as the input nodes for the ANN model. This selection process ensures that the variables used in the model are relevant and have a known association with FLD, providing some level of interpretability regarding the factors influencing the model's predictions.\n\nAdditionally, the performance of the ANN model was evaluated using various metrics, such as the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, and the Brier score. These evaluations help to understand the model's diagnostic accuracy and reliability, even if the internal mechanisms remain opaque. The model's high AUROC and accuracy indicate that it effectively captures the complex relationships between the input variables and the presence of FLD, despite the lack of transparency in its internal operations.",
  "model/output": "The model is a classification model. It predicts the presence or absence of fatty liver disease (FLD), with output values ranging from 0 (FLD absent) to 1 (FLD present). The model's performance was evaluated using various classification metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The best cut-off point for classification was determined using Youden's Index, which maximizes the sum of sensitivity and specificity. The model's output is used to classify patients into two categories: those with FLD and those without.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "Not applicable.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method for the artificial neural network (ANN) diagnostic model involved several key steps and metrics to ensure its robustness and accuracy. The study utilized a dataset of 14,792 subjects, which was randomly divided into a training group (70%) and a testing group (30%). Within the training group, 50% of the subjects were used to train the network, while the remaining 20% served as a validation group to prevent overfitting.\n\nThe performance of the ANN model was assessed using a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, with the area under the ROC curve (AUROC) serving as a primary indicator of diagnostic performance. The AUROC, along with its 95% confidence interval (CI), was calculated to evaluate the model's ability to distinguish between subjects with and without fatty liver disease (FLD).\n\nIn addition to AUROC, other evaluation indicators were computed for different cut-off points of the model's outputs. These included overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. The best cut-off point was determined using Youden\u2019s Index, which maximizes the sum of sensitivity and specificity.\n\nThe Brier score, a measure of the average squared difference between predicted probabilities and actual outcomes, was also calculated. A lower Brier score indicates higher accuracy. The agreement between the ANN model's predictions and ultrasonography results was assessed using Cohen\u2019s kappa coefficient, which measures the level of agreement beyond what would be expected by chance.\n\nThe degree of calibration of the model was evaluated using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, with a lower statistic indicating better calibration. The model's performance was compared with two other established models, the Fatty Liver Index (FLI) and the Hepatic Steatosis Index (HSI), which were retrained using the study's data. The comparison involved evaluating AUROC, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and other relevant metrics.\n\nOverall, the evaluation method ensured a comprehensive assessment of the ANN model's diagnostic capabilities, providing a clear understanding of its performance relative to existing models.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our evaluation of the diagnostic models for fatty liver disease (FLD), we employed a comprehensive set of performance metrics to ensure a thorough assessment. The primary metric reported is the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC), which provides a measure of the model's ability to discriminate between patients with and without FLD. This metric is crucial as it summarizes the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity across all possible classification thresholds.\n\nIn addition to AUROC, we calculated several other key evaluation indicators. These include overall accuracy, which is the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions made. Sensitivity, or true positive rate, measures the model's ability to correctly identify patients with FLD, while specificity, or true negative rate, assesses the model's ability to correctly identify patients without FLD. Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) were also computed to evaluate the probability that patients with a positive or negative test result truly have or do not have FLD, respectively.\n\nTo determine the optimal cut-off point for classification, we used Youden's Index, which maximizes the sum of sensitivity and specificity. This approach ensures that the chosen threshold balances the trade-off between these two metrics effectively.\n\nFurthermore, we reported the Brier score, which measures the mean squared difference between predicted probabilities and actual outcomes. A lower Brier score indicates higher accuracy in probability estimates.\n\nTo assess the agreement between the model predictions and ultrasonography results, we used Cohen's kappa coefficient. This statistic accounts for the agreement expected by chance, providing a more robust measure of inter-rater agreement.\n\nThe Hosmer-Lemeshow test was employed to evaluate the calibration of the models, which assesses how well the predicted probabilities match the observed outcomes. A lower Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic indicates better calibration.\n\nThese performance metrics are widely recognized and used in the literature, ensuring that our evaluation is representative and comparable to other studies in the field. The combination of these metrics provides a comprehensive view of the models' diagnostic capabilities, covering aspects of discrimination, calibration, and classification performance.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our evaluation, we compared our artificial neural network (ANN) model with two well-established models for diagnosing fatty liver disease (FLD): the Fatty Liver Index (FLI) and the Hepatic Steatosis Index (HSI). These models were chosen because they are widely recognized and have been validated in various populations.\n\nThe FLI model, proposed by Bedogni et al., incorporates variables such as BMI, waist circumference, triglycerides (TG), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). It has shown good performance in detecting FLD in its original study and has been validated in several other populations. For our comparison, we retrained the FLI model using our dataset to ensure it was tailored to our specific population.\n\nThe HSI model, proposed by Lee et al., uses BMI, the ALT/AST ratio, and the presence or absence of diabetes mellitus. It also demonstrated good performance in its original study and was retrained using our data for a fair comparison.\n\nTo evaluate the performance of these models, we used several metrics, including the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, and the Brier score. The AUROC is a major indicator of the model's diagnostic performance in a binary classifier system. The Brier score measures the average squared deviation between predicted probabilities and actual outcomes, with a lower score indicating higher accuracy.\n\nOur ANN model showed a significantly higher AUROC compared to both the FLI and HSI models in the testing group, indicating better diagnostic performance. The sensitivity and specificity of the ANN model were also higher than those of the FLI and HSI models. Additionally, the Brier score of the ANN model was lower, suggesting higher diagnostic accuracy.\n\nWe also assessed the agreement between the predictions of the three models and ultrasonography results using Cohen's kappa coefficient. The ANN model showed good agreement, with a kappa statistic of 0.642, which was higher than that of the FLI and HSI models.\n\nIn summary, our ANN model outperformed the FLI and HSI models in terms of AUROC, sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy. This comparison demonstrates the potential superiority of ANN analysis in diagnosing FLD, especially when dealing with complex, multidimensional systems.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our model's performance includes several key metrics, each accompanied by confidence intervals to provide a measure of reliability. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) is a primary indicator of diagnostic performance, with our model achieving an AUROC of 0.906 (95% CI, 0.902\u20130.911) in the training group and 0.908 (95% CI, 0.901\u20130.915) in the testing group. These intervals indicate a high level of confidence in our model's performance.\n\nStatistical significance is crucial for claiming superiority over other models and baselines. Our ANN model's AUROC is significantly higher than that of the FLI model (0.871; 95% CI, 0.864\u20130.878) and the HSI model (0.876; 95% CI, 0.871\u20130.881) in the training group, with a P-value of less than 0.05. Similarly, in the testing group, the ANN model's AUROC of 0.908 (95% CI, 0.901\u20130.915) is significantly higher than that of the FLI model (0.881; 95% CI, 0.872\u20130.891) and the HSI model (0.885; 95% CI, 0.877\u20130.893), again with a P-value of less than 0.05.\n\nOther evaluation indicators, such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value, were also calculated for different cut-off points. The best cut-off point, determined by Youden\u2019s Index, was used for classification in the testing group. The Brier score, which measures the average squared deviation between predicted probabilities and actual outcomes, was calculated to assess the model's accuracy. A lower Brier score indicates higher accuracy, and our model demonstrated a lower Brier score compared to the FLI and HSI models.\n\nThe agreement between the predictions of the three models and ultrasonography results was reported using Cohen\u2019s k coefficient. The ANN model showed good agreement with a k-statistic of 0.642, indicating a strong concordance with the ultrasonography results. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test was performed to evaluate the degree of calibration, with the ANN model showing a lower statistic, indicating better calibration capability.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics are robust, with confidence intervals providing a clear measure of reliability. The results are statistically significant, supporting the claim that our ANN model is superior to other models and baselines in diagnosing FLD.",
