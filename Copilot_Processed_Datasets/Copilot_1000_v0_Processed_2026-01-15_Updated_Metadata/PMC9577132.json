  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in our study was derived from digitized esophageal biopsy slides. A total of 40 carefully selected slides were utilized, encompassing the full spectrum of changes typically observed in esophageal eosinophilia. These slides ranged from normal mucosa to severe abnormalities, ensuring a comprehensive representation of the histologic features relevant to eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE).\n\nThe dataset included 10,726 annotated objects and covered 56.2 mm\u00b2 of semantic segmentation areas. These annotations were performed using a cloud-based, deep learning artificial intelligence platform. The slides were chosen to include a variety of histologic features, providing a robust foundation for training and validating our AI model.\n\nA subset of these cases was reserved as independent test sets to assess the model's validity outside the training set. This approach ensured that the model's performance could be evaluated on unseen data, enhancing the reliability of our findings. The dataset was annotated by specialized gastrointestinal pathologists, who scored each feature blindly and independently, ensuring unbiased and accurate ground truth data.\n\nThe dataset was not used in any previous paper or by the community. It was specifically curated for this study to develop and validate an AI model for the quantitative analysis of histopathologic features in EoE. The focus was on providing a detailed and accurate representation of the histologic spectrum of EoE, which is crucial for the development of a reliable AI tool.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset used for the development and validation of the AI model consisted of 40 carefully selected digitized esophageal biopsy slides. These slides contained the full spectrum of changes typically seen in the setting of esophageal eosinophilia, ranging from normal mucosa to severe abnormalities.\n\nThe dataset was divided into a training set and multiple test sets. The training set included the majority of the slides, which were used to train the AI model. A subset of cases was reserved as independent test sets to assess the validity of the AI model outside the training set. Specifically, 759 objects within 110 validation regions across 6 digital slides were reserved as one independent test set. Additionally, another independent test set consisted of 213 regions of interest within 10 slides, which were analyzed for eosinophils only by a single central pathologist.\n\nThe training set included a total of 10,726 objects, comprising 1,255 eosinophils, 8,766 squamous cell nuclei, and 705 lymphocytes. The semantic segmentation areas annotated for the model training covered 56.2 mm\u00b2, including various tissue features such as tissue, tissue sublevels, intercellular edema, granules, lamina propria, collagen, mature/surface epithelial layer, and basal epithelial layer.\n\nThe independent test sets were used to validate the AI model's performance against human annotations. The results from these test sets were crucial in determining the model's accuracy, reproducibility, and its comparison to human pathologists.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used is deep learning, specifically a convolutional neural network (CNN). This type of algorithm is well-suited for image analysis tasks, such as those involved in digital pathology.\n\nThe algorithm is not entirely new, as CNNs have been extensively used in various image recognition tasks. However, the specific implementation and application to the histopathologic features of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) are novel. This model was developed using a cloud-based, deep learning artificial intelligence platform, which allows for the annotation of whole-slide images and the training of the model on a large dataset.\n\nThe reason this work was not published in a machine-learning journal is that the primary focus of the study is on the development and technical validation of an AI tool for the quantitative analysis of histopathologic features in EoE. The innovation lies in the application of deep learning techniques to this specific medical problem, rather than in the development of a new machine-learning algorithm. The study aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of the AI model in providing quantitative, reproducible, and standardized analyses in cases of EoE, which is of significant interest to the medical and pathology communities.",

  "optimization/encoding": "For the development of our AI model, a total of 10,726 objects and 56.2 mm\u00b2 of semantic segmentation areas were annotated on whole-slide images using a cloud-based, deep learning AI platform. The annotated objects included 1,255 eosinophils, 8,766 squamous cell nuclei, and 705 lymphocytes. The semantic segmentation areas encompassed various features such as tissue, tissue sublevels, intercellular edema/dilated intercellular spaces (DIS), granules, lamina propria, collagen, mature/surface epithelial layer, and basal epithelial layer.\n\nThe data encoding process involved defining specific features for the model to recognize. Objects such as eosinophils, lymphocytes, and squamous cell nuclei were labeled based on their morphological characteristics. For instance, eosinophils were identified by their nucleated cells with typical eosinophilic granules, while lymphocytes were recognized by their round or elongated cells with dark, homogeneous nuclei. Squamous cell nuclei were identified by their round to oval shape surrounded by amphophilic or eosinophilic cytoplasm.\n\nSemantic segmentation features were also defined, including the total tissue area of esophageal squamous mucosa, excluding non-squamous mucosa and debris. Specific layers such as the basal layer, surface/mature layer, spongiosis/DIS, and lamina propria were annotated based on their distinct morphological features. The basal layer was defined as the squamous cell layer along the deep aspect of the epithelium, while the surface/mature layer was identified by its abundant, eosinophilic to clear cytoplasm.\n\nThe annotated data was then used to train the AI model, which was capable of performing automated analyses of all histological levels on a given slide or any specifically designated area of interest. The model's performance was evaluated using various metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1-score, error rate, false-positive rate, and false-negative rate. The normality of the distribution of the time variable was examined using the Shapiro\u2013Wilk normality test, and statistical analyses were performed using MedCalc Statistical Software version 19.2.6.",

  "model/interpretability": "The model developed for the quantitative analysis of histopathologic features of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is not a black box. It incorporates several transparent and interpretable components that allow for a clear understanding of its decision-making processes.\n\nOne of the key aspects of the model's transparency is its use of spatial analysis. This capability enables the identification of specific features based on spatial relationships between objects. For instance, eosinophilic abscesses can be detected by analyzing the center-to-center distances between eosinophils. This spatial analysis does not rely on a single, opaque decision but rather on measurable distances and clustering patterns, making it interpretable.\n\nThe model also utilizes object and instance segmentation features, which are studied using spatial analysis. This means that the recognition of features like granules can be understood in terms of their spatial relationships, such as center-to-center, center-to-edge, or edge-to-edge distances. This approach provides a clear and interpretable basis for feature recognition.\n\nAdditionally, the model's ability to calculate various clustering and distribution indexes, such as Hopkins Statistics and clustering value, within each fragment, region of interest (ROI), or whole slide, adds another layer of interpretability. These indexes provide quantitative measures that can be understood and verified independently of the model's internal workings.\n\nThe use of semantic segmentation features further enhances the model's transparency. These features are rated for accuracy using a clear scoring system, which includes categories like \"perfect or nearly perfect,\" \"very good,\" \"good,\" and \"insufficient.\" This scoring system allows for a straightforward evaluation of the model's performance in recognizing specific histologic features.\n\nMoreover, the model's performance is validated through comparisons with human annotations by specialized gastrointestinal pathologists. This validation process involves blind and independent scoring of the same criteria as the AI model, providing a transparent and objective assessment of the model's accuracy.\n\nIn summary, the model's use of spatial analysis, object and instance segmentation, clustering indexes, and a clear scoring system for semantic segmentation features makes it transparent and interpretable. These components allow for a clear understanding of how the model recognizes and quantifies histopathologic features in EoE.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is primarily a classification model, designed for the quantitative analysis of histopathologic features in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). It focuses on identifying and classifying specific objects and semantic segmentation layers within esophageal biopsy slides. The model can detect and count objects such as eosinophils, lymphocytes, and squamous nuclei. Additionally, it performs semantic segmentation to identify and measure areas like total tissue, squamous epithelium, epithelial layers (basal and surface), dilated intercellular spaces (DIS), lamina propria, and collagen tissue. The model also includes an instance segmentation layer for granules, which are counted as objects and measured as areas simultaneously. This classification approach allows for detailed and automated analysis of histological features, providing a comprehensive evaluation of EoE-related changes in esophageal biopsies.",

  "model/availability": "The software used for the development of the AI model is a cloud-based, supervised deep learning platform provided by Aiforia Technologies. The platform allows for the creation and training of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze whole-slide images. The specific details about the availability of the source code or executable files for public use are not provided. However, the platform itself is commercially available and can be accessed through Aiforia Technologies. The model was trained using this platform, and the resulting AI tool can be utilized for the evaluation of histologic features in the spectrum of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). The performance and validation of the model were conducted using this proprietary software, ensuring that the AI tool meets the required standards for accuracy and reproducibility.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the AI model involved several rigorous steps to ensure its accuracy and reliability. Initially, a subset of 759 objects, including eosinophils, squamous nuclei, and lymphocytes, within 110 validation regions across 6 digital slides, was reserved as independent test sets. These test sets were used to assess the model's performance outside the training data. Five specialized gastrointestinal pathologists independently scored the same criteria as the AI model on these reserved test sets, ensuring a blind and unbiased evaluation.\n\nAdditionally, a separate independent test set consisting of 213 regions of interest within 10 slides, containing 727 eosinophils, was analyzed by a single central pathologist. This evaluation yielded detailed performance metrics, including total error percentage, false positive rate, false negative rate, precision, sensitivity, and the harmonic mean as the F1-score. These metrics were crucial in comparing the AI model's performance against human pathologists, determining its superiority or non-inferiority for specific object features.\n\nThe accuracy of semantic segmentation features was also assessed by five independent pathologists. They visually inspected 19 validation regions of interest within 9 digital slides, representing the full spectrum of histologic changes related to each feature. The AI model's accuracy was rated according to a predefined scale, ranging from \"perfect or nearly perfect\" to \"insufficient,\" based on the presence and significance of errors.\n\nStatistical analysis was performed using MedCalc Statistical Software, examining the normality of the distribution of time variables. For normally distributed data, average and standard deviation were used; otherwise, median and interquartile range were employed. This comprehensive evaluation process ensured that the AI model's performance was thoroughly validated and comparable to that of experienced human pathologists.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our evaluation of the AI model, we reported a comprehensive set of performance metrics to ensure a thorough assessment of its capabilities. These metrics include sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1-score, error rate, false-positive rate, and false-negative rate. These metrics were calculated for both the AI model and the pathologists to provide a comparative analysis.\n\nThe F1-score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and sensitivity, was particularly emphasized. For most histologic features in the spectrum of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), the AI model achieved F1 scores of over 90%, indicating high accuracy. Specifically, the model's performance for cell type features was found to be similar or non-inferior to that of gastrointestinal pathologists, with F1-scores ranging from 94.5 to 94.8 for AI versus human comparisons and from 92.6 to 96.0 for human versus human comparisons.\n\nAdditionally, we evaluated the model's performance on segmentation area features using a rating scale that assessed accuracy. Features such as tissue, spongiosis, basal layer, surface layer, lamina propria, and collagen were rated in the \"very good\" to \"perfect or nearly perfect\" range, demonstrating the model's high accuracy in these areas. Degranulation, however, was rated between \"good\" and \"very good,\" indicating some room for improvement.\n\nThe reported metrics are representative of standard practices in the field, ensuring that our evaluation is both rigorous and comparable to other studies in digital pathology and AI model assessment. This set of metrics provides a clear and comprehensive view of the model's performance, highlighting its strengths and areas for potential improvement.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our evaluation, we did not compare our AI model to publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. Instead, we focused on validating our model's performance against human experts. We assessed the model's accuracy by comparing its feature recognition to annotations made by specialized gastrointestinal pathologists. These pathologists scored the same criteria as the AI model on reserved test sets, ensuring a blind and independent evaluation.\n\nFor the comparison, we used a subset of 759 objects, including eosinophils, squamous nuclei, and lymphocytes, across 110 validation regions within 6 digital slides. Additionally, a separate independent test set of 213 regions of interest within 10 slides, containing 727 eosinophils, was analyzed by a single central gastrointestinal pathologist. This approach allowed us to generate an inter-operator agreement report, which included metrics such as total error percentage, false positive percentage, false negative percentage, precision, sensitivity, and the F1-score. These metrics were crucial in assessing the AI model's performance relative to human performance, determining its superiority or non-inferiority for specific object features, such as different cell types.\n\nWe also evaluated semantic segmentation features by having 5 independent pathologists visually inspect 19 validation regions of interest within 9 digital slides. This inspection covered the full spectrum of histologic changes related to each feature of interest, providing a comprehensive assessment of the model's accuracy. The AI model's performance was rated according to a predefined scoring system that categorized the accuracy into levels ranging from \"perfect or nearly perfect\" to \"insufficient.\"\n\nRegarding simpler baselines, our focus was on developing a sophisticated AI model capable of detailed analysis and spatial distribution of histologic features. Therefore, we did not perform comparisons to simpler baselines. Instead, we aimed to demonstrate the model's high accuracy and reproducibility in recognizing various histologic features in the spectrum of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). The model's performance was evaluated using rigorous statistical methods, including the calculation of sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1-score, error rate, false-positive rate, and false-negative rate. These metrics were compared between the AI model and human pathologists to ensure the model's reliability and effectiveness in clinical settings.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the AI model's performance included several key metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1-score, error rate, false-positive rate, and false-negative rate. These metrics were calculated for both the AI model and pathologists to ensure a comprehensive comparison.\n\nStatistical significance was assessed using the Shapiro\u2013Wilk normality test to examine the distribution of the time variable. For normally distributed data, average and standard deviation were used, while median and interquartile range were employed for non-normally distributed data. This approach ensured that the performance metrics were robust and reliable.\n\nThe AI model demonstrated high accuracy in recognizing most histologic features in the spectrum of EoE, with F1 scores exceeding 90% for the majority of features. The performance of the model for each feature was compared to original annotations, and the results showed that the AI model's performance was similar or non-inferior to that of gastrointestinal pathologists. This indicates a high level of confidence in the model's ability to accurately identify and quantify histologic features.\n\nAdditionally, the reproducibility of the AI model was assessed by re-analyzing digital slides, which resulted in less than 0.1% difference for all object counts and semantic segmentation area measurements. This high level of reproducibility further supports the reliability and consistency of the model's performance.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics were rigorously evaluated using statistical methods, and the results showed that the AI model performed at a level comparable to or better than human pathologists. The inclusion of confidence intervals and statistical significance testing ensures that the claims of superiority and non-inferiority are well-founded.",
