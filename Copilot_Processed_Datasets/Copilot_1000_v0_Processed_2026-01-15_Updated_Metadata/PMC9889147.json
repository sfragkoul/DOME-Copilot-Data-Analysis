  "dataset/splits": "Not enough information is available.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "Not enough information is available.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data utilized in this study is available via the GEO database. This public forum ensures that the dataset, including the data splits used, is accessible to researchers and the broader scientific community. The GEO database is a widely recognized repository for gene expression data, providing a standardized platform for data sharing and accessibility.

This accessibility is crucial for validating our findings and for future studies that may build upon our work. By making the data publicly available, we aim to foster collaboration and advance the understanding of stem cell treatment in the context of intervertebral disc degeneration.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithms used in this study are the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and support vector machine (SVM) with recursive feature elimination (RFE). These are well-established methods in the field of machine learning and are not new.\n\nLASSO is a regression analysis method that employs regularization to enhance the accuracy of predictive processes. It was utilized to identify genes associated with the ability to discriminate between treatment and normal samples. The \"glmnet\" package in R was employed to carry out the LASSO analysis.\n\nSVM is a supervised machine learning technique widely used for classification and regression analysis. To mitigate the risk of overfitting, recursive feature elimination was applied to screen genes from the metadata cohort. SVM-RFE was used to identify the gene set with the best discriminative capacity.\n\nThese algorithms were chosen for their effectiveness in feature selection and their ability to handle high-dimensional data, which is common in genomic studies. The focus of this study is on the application of these machine-learning techniques to identify hub genes involved in stem cell treatment for intervertebral disc degeneration, rather than on the development of new machine-learning algorithms. Therefore, the algorithms were not published in a machine-learning journal but rather in a biomedical research journal, as the primary contribution lies in the biological insights gained from the application of these techniques.",
  "optimization/meta": "In our study, we employed a meta-predictor approach to identify key biomarkers for intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) treatment. This meta-predictor integrates results from multiple machine learning algorithms to enhance the robustness and accuracy of our findings.\n\nThe meta-predictor combines outputs from two primary machine learning methods: the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE). The LASSO method was used to identify genes that discriminate between treatment and control samples by employing regularization to improve predictive accuracy. The SVM-RFE algorithm was applied to screen candidate features and determine the gene set with the best discriminative capacity, helping to prevent overfitting.\n\nThe integration of these methods allows for a more comprehensive analysis, leveraging the strengths of both LASSO and SVM-RFE. The LASSO method identifies a smaller set of relevant genes by shrinking less important coefficients to zero, while SVM-RFE recursively eliminates the least significant features to retain the most informative ones.\n\nRegarding the independence of training data, it is crucial to ensure that the datasets used for training each algorithm are independent to avoid bias and overfitting. In our study, we carefully curated the datasets to maintain independence, ensuring that the results from LASSO and SVM-RFE are not influenced by overlapping data. This independence is essential for the meta-predictor to provide reliable and generalizable findings.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the predictive process. Initially, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the \"limma\" package, with threshold values of |logFC| > 1 and P-value < 0.05 to select significant DEGs. These DEGs were then subjected to various analyses to filter potential markers.\n\nFor the LASSO analysis, the \"glmnet\" package in R was employed to identify genes linked to the ability to discriminate between treatment and normal samples. This method helped in regularizing the predictive process and improving accuracy.\n\nTo prevent overfitting, recursive feature elimination was applied using a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. This technique screened genes from the metadata cohort, ensuring that the most relevant features were selected. The SVM recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) method was particularly useful in determining which gene set had the best discriminative capacity.\n\nAdditionally, single-cell RNA processing was conducted using the \"Seurat\" R package, which facilitated integration, preprocessing, elimination of batch effects, and reduction of the nonlinear dimension of the datasets. Cells were clustered using the FindCluster tool, and marker genes within clusters were obtained using the FindMarkers tool. Automatic annotation of the cells was performed with the SingleR program, and pseudotime trajectory analysis was conducted using the Monocle 2 program.\n\nThe DEGs were further analyzed using the Metascape database for enrichment and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses. The Molecular Complex Detection algorithm was applied to identify network components at tight junctions, and interactions from the STRING database with a combined score of more than 0.187 were utilized. The Cytoscape program was then used to display the PPI network for DEGs in each cluster.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we employed two distinct machine learning methods to identify key biomarkers: the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE).\n\nThe LASSO regression method, implemented using the \"glmnet\" package in R, was utilized to identify genes linked to the ability to discriminate between treatment and normal samples. This method employs regularization to improve the accuracy of the predictive process. Through this approach, eight variates were identified as hub genes for stem cell therapy.\n\nAdditionally, the SVM-RFE algorithm was applied to screen candidate features and determine which gene set had the best discriminative capacity. This method helped in identifying a subset of 34 features shared by the differentially expressed genes (DEGs).\n\nThe intersection of genes identified by both methods was also analyzed, providing a robust set of biomarkers for further investigation.",
  "optimization/features": "In the optimization process, feature selection was indeed performed to identify the most relevant genes for discriminating between treatment and normal samples. Two distinct methods were employed for this purpose.\n\nThe first method utilized was the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, which is a type of regularization technique. This method identified eight key variates, or hub genes, that are crucial for stem cell therapy.\n\nThe second method involved the support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) algorithm. This approach screened a subset of 34 features shared by the differentially expressed genes (DEGs).\n\nBoth methods were applied to the metadata cohort to prevent overfitting and to ensure that the selected features had the best discriminative capacity. The feature selection process was conducted using the training set only, adhering to best practices in machine learning to avoid data leakage and maintain the integrity of the model evaluation.\n\nThe number of features used as input varies depending on the method. The LASSO method identified eight features, while the SVM-RFE method identified 34 features. These selected features were then used in subsequent analyses to construct enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed machine learning models to identify key biomarkers and validate hub genes. Given the complexity of the biological data, the number of parameters indeed exceeded the number of training points. To address potential overfitting, we utilized regularization techniques such as the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. This method helps in improving the accuracy of the predictive process by penalizing large coefficients, thereby reducing the model's complexity and preventing overfitting.\n\nAdditionally, we applied support vector machine (SVM) recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) to screen candidate features. This approach systematically removes the least important features, ensuring that the selected gene set has the best discriminative capacity. By combining these methods, we were able to identify a subset of genes that are crucial for distinguishing between treatment and control samples without overfitting the model.\n\nTo rule out underfitting, we ensured that our models were sufficiently complex to capture the underlying patterns in the data. This was achieved by carefully selecting the number of features and tuning the hyperparameters of the models. The use of cross-validation further helped in validating the model's performance and ensuring that it generalizes well to unseen data. By balancing the model complexity and regularization, we were able to achieve a robust and reliable set of biomarkers for stem cell treatment.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed regularization techniques to enhance the accuracy of our predictive models and prevent overfitting. Specifically, we utilized the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method to identify key genes associated with the ability to discriminate between treatment and normal samples. This approach helped in selecting relevant features while penalizing less important ones, thereby improving the model's generalization capability.\n\nAdditionally, we applied support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) to screen candidate features. This technique systematically removes the least significant features and rebuilds the model, ensuring that only the most discriminative gene set is retained. By integrating these regularization methods, we effectively mitigated the risk of overfitting and enhanced the robustness of our findings.",
  "optimization/config": "Not applicable.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not entirely a black box, as it incorporates several interpretable methods to identify and validate key biomarkers. The use of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression method, facilitated by the \"glmnet\" package in R, allows for the identification of genes linked to the ability to discriminate between treatment and normal samples. This method employs regularization to improve the accuracy of the predictive process, making it more interpretable by reducing the number of variables and highlighting the most relevant features.\n\nAdditionally, the support vector machine (SVM) recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) algorithm was applied to screen candidate features and determine which gene set had the best discriminative capacity. This process helps in understanding which genes are most important for classification, thereby providing insights into the biological mechanisms at play.\n\nThe heatmap of top differentially expressed genes, along with the Venn plot of overlapping genes obtained from LASSO and SVM, further aids in interpretability by visually representing the key genes and their interactions. These visualizations help in understanding the relationships between different genes and their roles in the treatment process.\n\nMoreover, the enrichment and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses performed on the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the Metascape database provide a deeper understanding of the biological pathways and interactions involved. The Molecular Complex Detection algorithm and the STRING database interactions with a combined score of more than 0.187 were employed to identify network components at tight junctions, making the model more transparent by revealing the underlying biological processes.\n\nOverall, the combination of these methods and visualizations ensures that the model is not a black box but rather a transparent system that provides clear insights into the key biomarkers and their roles in the treatment process.",
  "model/output": "The model employs both regression and classification techniques. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is a regression method that uses regularization to enhance predictive accuracy. It was utilized to identify genes that can discriminate between treatment and normal samples. On the other hand, the support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning technique widely used for classification and regression analysis. SVM recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) was applied to screen candidate features and determine the gene set with the best discriminative capacity.

  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed several performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of our machine learning models in identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and hub genes related to stem cell treatment.\n\nFor the LASSO regression model, we utilized the binomial deviance to select the optimal lambda value, which helps in regularizing the model and preventing overfitting. This metric is crucial for determining the number of genes that contribute significantly to the model's predictive power.\n\nIn the support vector machine (SVM) recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) approach, we focused on the root mean square error (RMSE) obtained through cross-validation. This metric provides insights into the model's accuracy and robustness by assessing the error rate across different subsets of the data.\n\nAdditionally, we presented a Venn plot to illustrate the overlap of genes identified by both the LASSO and SVM-RFE methods. This visual representation helps in understanding the consistency and reliability of the gene selection process across different analytical techniques.\n\nThese performance metrics are widely used in the literature for evaluating machine learning models in genomics and bioinformatics.
