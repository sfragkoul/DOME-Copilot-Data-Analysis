The TCGA-DLBC and GSE181063 datasets were used to evaluate the prognostic role of SNCA in DLBCL.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets used in this study were obtained from various sources, including the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The datasets were split based on their specific purposes in the study. For instance, the GSE177477 dataset, which includes samples from COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, was used for initial gene expression analysis and screening of key cuprotosis-related genes (CRGs). This dataset was obtained from the GPL23195 platform and includes 29 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases and 18 healthy controls.\n\nTo ensure independence between training and test sets, different datasets were used for training and validation purposes. For example, the GSE177477 dataset was used for initial screening and model development, while the GSE176405 dataset, obtained from the GPL16699 platform, was used for validation. The GSE176405 dataset includes samples from bronchial epithelial cells of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and healthy individuals, providing an independent set for verifying the results obtained from the GSE177477 dataset.\n\nThe distribution of samples in these datasets compares favorably with previously published machine learning datasets in the field of genomics and cancer research. The datasets include a mix of normal and diseased samples, providing a comprehensive view of gene expression patterns. For example, the GSE56315 and GSE25638 datasets, both obtained from the GPL570 platform, include matched normal samples and Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) samples. This ensures that the models developed are robust and generalizable to different types of data.\n\nTo enforce the independence of training and test sets, different platforms and sample types were used. For instance, the TCGA-DLBC dataset, which includes 47 DLBCL samples, was used for analyzing key regulated genes and evaluating the prognostic role of SNCA in DLBCL. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) dataset, which includes 337 normal samples, was used for comparative analysis. This approach ensures that the results are not biased by the overlap of samples between training and test sets.\n\nIn summary, the datasets were carefully selected and split to ensure independence between training and test sets. The use of different platforms and sample types, along with the inclusion of both normal and diseased samples, provides a robust framework for developing and validating machine learning models in the context of COVID-19 and DLBCL research.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in our study is the Random Forest (RF) model. This is a well-established ensemble learning method known for its accuracy and high precision in classification tasks. We utilized the randomForest package in R software to develop our RF model, with specific parameters set as ntree = 500 and mtry = 3.\n\nThe RF algorithm is not new; it has been extensively used and validated in various fields, including bioinformatics and medical research. The choice to use RF in our study was driven by its robustness in handling large datasets and its ability to identify key features contributing to classification. This makes it particularly suitable for screening differentially expressed genes and selecting those with the highest contribution to classification.\n\nGiven that RF is a widely recognized and established algorithm, it was not necessary to publish it in a machine-learning journal. Instead, our focus was on applying this proven method to analyze specific biological datasets, such as those related to COVID-19 and Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). By leveraging the strengths of RF, we were able to identify key cuproptosis-related genes, including SNCA, and validate their significance in our study.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employed in our study does not function as a meta-predictor. Instead, it relies on a single machine-learning algorithm, specifically the Random Forest (RF) method. The RF model was developed using the randomForest package in R software, with parameters set to ntree = 500 and mtry = 3. This model was used to screen and select genes with the highest contribution to classification as key cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs). The screening threshold for key CRGs was set at IncNodePurity > 0.6.\n\nThe data used for training and validation were obtained from independent datasets, ensuring that the training data is independent. Specifically, we used COVID-19 samples from the GSE177477 dataset for preliminary analysis and then validated the results using the GSE176405 dataset. This approach ensures that the model's performance and the selected key genes are robust and generalizable.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing steps were crucial for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the machine-learning algorithms used in our study. Initially, raw data from the GEO databases were downloaded as MINiML files, which contain comprehensive information for all platforms, samples, and GSE records. These datasets underwent normalization using log2 transformation to stabilize variance and make the data more amenable to analysis.\n\nFor microarray data, the normalize quantiles function from the preprocessCore package in R software (version 4.2.1) was employed to normalize the data. This method ensures that the distribution of probe intensities is similar across all arrays, reducing technical variability.\n\nProbes were then converted to gene symbols using the annotation information provided in the platform. Probes that matched multiple genes were removed to avoid ambiguity, and for genes measured by multiple probes, the average expression value was calculated to represent the final expression value.\n\nBatch effects, which can arise from differences in sample handling or processing, were addressed using the removeBatchEffect function from the limma package in R. This step is essential for integrating datasets from different batches or platforms, ensuring that the subsequent differential analysis is not confounded by technical artifacts.\n\nAfter preprocessing, the data were ready for differential expression analysis and machine learning. A Random Forest (RF) model was developed with parameters ntree = 500 and mtry = 3 using the randomForest package in R. The model was used to screen for key cuprotosis-related genes (CRGs) by identifying genes with the highest contribution to classification, as indicated by an IncNodePurity threshold greater than 0.6.\n\nThis rigorous preprocessing and encoding pipeline ensured that the data were of high quality and suitable for robust machine-learning analysis, enabling the identification of key genes associated with COVID-19 and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we developed a Random Forest model with specific input parameters. The model was configured with `ntree = 500` and `mtry = 3`. The parameter `mtry` represents the number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split, which is a crucial parameter in Random Forest models. We selected `mtry = 3` based on common practices and empirical performance in similar biological datasets. This choice aims to balance the trade-off between bias and variance, ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data. The number of trees (`ntree = 500`) was chosen to provide a robust and stable model, as increasing the number of trees typically improves the model's performance up to a certain point. These parameters were set using the randomForest package in R software, which is widely used for its efficiency and effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized a total of 62 cuprotosis-related genes (CRGs) as input features for our machine learning models. These genes were obtained from previously published literature. To ensure the robustness of our analysis, we performed feature selection using the training set only. This process involved using the limma package in R software to conduct preliminary screening of differentially expressed genes. We applied a relatively relaxed threshold for this screening, defining differentially expressed genes as those with a P-value less than 0.05 and a fold change (FC) greater than 1.50 or less than 0.67. Subsequently, we employed a Random Forest (RF) model to further screen and select the genes with the highest contribution to classification. The threshold for screening key CRGs was set at IncNodePurity greater than 0.6. This method allowed us to retain as many potentially valuable genes as possible while ensuring that the selected features were relevant and contributed significantly to the classification task.",
  "optimization/fitting": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our models. One of the key methods used was the Random Forest (RF) model, which inherently helps to reduce overfitting by averaging multiple decision trees. This ensemble approach provides a more stable and generalizable prediction compared to a single decision tree.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized the removeBatchEffect function from the limma package in R software. This function helps to mitigate batch effects, which can introduce noise and lead to overfitting. By removing these batch effects, we ensured that our data was more consistent and representative of the underlying biological signals.\n\nFurthermore, we applied stringent thresholds for gene selection. For instance, we used a relatively relaxed threshold for preliminary screening of differentially expressed genes (P < 0.05 and Fold change (FC) > 1.50 or FC < 0.67). This approach allowed us to retain as many potentially valuable genes as possible while still controlling for false positives. For further screening, we used a more stringent threshold (IncNodePurity > 0.6) to select genes with the highest contribution to classification, ensuring that only the most relevant genes were included in our final models.\n\nThese regularization techniques collectively helped to enhance the reliability and generalizability of our findings, reducing the risk of overfitting and ensuring that our results are robust and reproducible.",
  "optimization/config": "Not applicable.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a blackbox model. Instead, it leverages a Random Forest (RF) approach, which is known for its interpretability. The RF model was used to identify key genes with the highest contribution to classification, specifically those with an IncNodePurity greater than 0.6. This threshold ensures that the selected genes are significantly influential in the model's decision-making process.\n\nOne of the key strengths of the RF model is its ability to provide insights into feature importance. By examining the contribution of each gene to the classification task, it becomes possible to identify which genes are most critical. For instance, genes such as SLC31A1, SLC31A2, MT4, and SNCA were highlighted as having the highest contribution to classification. This transparency allows researchers to understand not only the predictive power of the model but also the biological significance of the identified genes.\n\nFurthermore, the use of Spearman correlation analysis to screen genes closely related to SNCA adds another layer of interpretability. By calculating the correlation coefficient between SNCA and other genes, it is possible to identify genes that are positively or negatively correlated with SNCA. This information is crucial for understanding the underlying biological pathways and interactions.\n\nIn summary, the model's transparency is evident through the use of RF for feature importance and Spearman correlation analysis for gene screening. These methods provide clear examples of how the model identifies key genes and their relationships, making it a valuable tool for both predictive and exploratory analyses.",
  "model/output": "The model developed is a classification model. It utilizes the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, which is a popular machine learning technique for classification tasks. The RF model was trained to identify key genes with the highest contribution to classification, specifically focusing on genes related to cuproptosis in COVID-19 and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and precision, highlighting its effectiveness in distinguishing between different gene expressions. Additionally, the model's output was validated using independent datasets, further confirming its reliability in classifying key genes.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time for the model varied depending on the specific tasks and datasets used. For the initial screening of differentially expressed genes, the process involved data standardization and preliminary screening using the limma package in R software. This step was followed by the application of a Random Forest (RF) model to further screen and select key genes. The RF model was developed with parameters ntree = 500 and mtry = 3, which required significant computational resources and time.\n\nFor the analysis of COVID-19 samples from the GSE177477 dataset, the differential gene analysis and subsequent RF model screening were conducted. This process included evaluating the expression levels of genes like SNCA in asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 patients. The validation of these results using the GSE176405 dataset also contributed to the overall execution time.\n\nIn the context of pan-cancer analysis, the Gene Expression Profiling Interaction Analysis (GEPIA) tool was used to evaluate SNCA expression data from the TCGA database. This involved comparing gene expression profiles with specific thresholds and conducting Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, which added to the computational time.\n\nFor the construction of the SNCA overexpression DLBCL cell model, the process included cell culture, transfection, and verification using qPCR. These experimental steps, while not directly related to model execution time, are part of the overall workflow that influenced the timeline.\n\nAdditionally, pathway analysis and correlation studies using the psych and ClusterProfiler packages in R software were performed. These analyses involved Spearman correlation calculations and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), which are computationally intensive and time-consuming.\n\nOverall, the model execution time was influenced by the complexity of the datasets, the computational requirements of the RF model, and the various analytical steps involved in gene expression analysis, pathway analysis, and validation studies. The specific execution times for each step were not explicitly mentioned, but it is clear that the process involved multiple stages of data processing and analysis, each contributing to the overall time required to complete the study.",

Additionally, the psych package in R was used for Spearman correlation analysis, and the ClusterProfiler package was utilized for Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). The limma and preprocessCore packages in R were used for data normalization and batch effect removal. The immunedeconv R package with the TIMER method was used to analyze immune cell infiltration. These packages are accessible through the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and can be installed and used by researchers following standard procedures. The specific datasets used, such as those from the GEO and TCGA databases, are also publicly available and can be accessed through their respective platforms.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method employed in this study involved a multi-step process to ensure the robustness and validity of the findings. Initially, a relatively relaxed threshold was used for the preliminary screening of genes, defined as P < 0.05 and a fold change (FC) greater than 1.50 or less than 0.67. This approach aimed to retain as many potentially valuable genes as possible.\n\nFollowing the preliminary screening, a machine learning model, specifically a Random Forest (RF) model, was utilized to further refine the selection of key genes. The RF model was developed with parameters ntree = 500 and mtry = 3 using the randomForest package in R software. The threshold for screening key cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) was set at IncNodePurity > 0.6.\n\nTo validate the key genes identified, an independent dataset (GSE177477) was used. This dataset included COVID-19 samples, and the same screening criteria (P < 0.05 and FC > 1.50 or < 0.67) were applied to analyze the differential genes. The RF model was then used to select the gene with the highest contribution to classification (IncNodePurity > 0.6) as the key gene. Additionally, the GSE176405 dataset was analyzed using R software version 4.2.1 to verify the results obtained from the GSE177477 dataset.\n\nFurthermore, the study evaluated the potential correlation between SNCA and the severity of COVID-19 by analyzing the expression level of SNCA in asymptomatic and symptomatic infection patient samples from the GSE177477 dataset. This involved comparing 18 asymptomatic infection patient samples with 11 symptomatic infection patient samples.\n\nThe prognostic value of SNCA in pan-cancers was confirmed by analyzing its expression level through the TCGA database. The Gene Expression Profiling Interaction Analysis (GEPIA) tool was used to evaluate SNCA expression data from 8587 normal samples and 9736 tumor samples. The Analysis of Variance method was employed with thresholds of |log2FC| cutoff = 1 and q-value cutoff = 0.01. The 'Survival Map' module from GEPIA was used to select TCGA malignancies where SNCA expression significantly correlated with overall survival (OS). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was then performed to categorize samples into high-expression and low-expression subgroups based on SNCA expression.\n\nFor Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), the study analyzed key regulated genes with significant differences between diseases using the TCGA-DLBC dataset. This analysis was confirmed through the GSE56315 and GSE25638 datasets, where P < 0.05 and FC > 1.50 or < 0.67 were considered significant. The prognostic role of SNCA in DLBCL was evaluated using the TCGA-DLBC and GSE181063 datasets, with Kaplan-Meier curves analyzing SNCA's high and low expression to assess the prognosis of DLBCL patients after treatment.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation method involved a combination of preliminary gene screening, machine learning models, independent dataset validation, and comprehensive analysis of gene expression and prognostic value in various cancer types and COVID-19 samples.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our models, we primarily focused on metrics that assess the accuracy and precision of gene classification. One of the key metrics reported is the IncNodePurity, which was used as a threshold to screen for key genes. An IncNodePurity greater than 0.6 was considered significant in identifying genes with the highest contribution to classification. This metric is particularly useful in random forest models, as it measures the purity of the nodes in the decision trees, indicating how well the model is able to separate different classes.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized fold change (FC) and p-values to identify differentially expressed genes. A fold change greater than 1.50 or less than 0.67, combined with a p-value less than 0.05, was used as the screening threshold for differentially expressed genes. These thresholds are commonly used in the literature and provide a robust measure of gene expression differences.\n\nFor the validation of key genes, we employed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to evaluate the prognostic value of gene expression levels. This method is widely accepted in the field of oncology and provides a clear visual representation of survival probabilities over time.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics reported in our study are representative of those commonly used in the literature. The combination of IncNodePurity, fold change, p-values, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis ensures a comprehensive evaluation of gene classification and prognostic value.",

This threshold helped in identifying genes with the highest contribution to classification, ensuring that our selected genes were statistically significant.\n\nWe validated our findings using independent datasets, such as GSE177477 and GSE176405, to confirm the results obtained from the initial dataset. This cross-validation step is crucial for assessing the robustness and generalizability of our method.\n\nAdditionally, we performed Spearman correlation analysis to identify genes closely related to SNCA, using a correlation coefficient threshold of |R| > 0.3 and a P-value < 0.05. This analysis helped in understanding the relationships between SNCA and other genes in the context of DLBCL and COVID-19.\n\nFor pathway analysis, we used Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) with a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.2 and a normalized P-value < 0.05. These thresholds ensured that the identified pathways were statistically significant and relevant to the biological processes under study.\n\nIn summary, our evaluation process included multiple statistical measures and validation steps to ensure the confidence and reliability of our results.
