  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study consists of anonymized chest X-ray (CXR) images obtained in the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format. These images were sourced from 559 patients. The data was curated and preprocessed using in-house annotation software, where two experienced cardiologists manually delineated the cardiac contour over the CXR images. The region for extracting radiomic features was limited to include the coronary arteries, excluding the aortic arch to prevent the inclusion of aortic arch calcification. This approach ensures that the cardiac contour is comparable to those seen in previous studies. The dataset was divided into a training cohort and a validation cohort in a 7:3 ratio, ensuring that all clinical characteristics were well matched between the cohorts. This division helps in developing and validating the radiomics score (RS) formula effectively.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into two main splits: a training cohort and a validation cohort. The training cohort consisted of 391 data points, while the validation cohort had 168 data points. This division followed a 7:3 ratio. Both cohorts were well matched in terms of clinical characteristics, including similar calcium score differences between groups with a coronary artery calcium (CAC) score of \u2265 100 and those with a CAC score of <100. This ensures that the models trained on the training cohort could be effectively validated on the separate validation cohort.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset consisted of anonymized chest X-ray (CXR) images of 559 patients, obtained in DICOM format. To develop and validate the radiomics score (RS)-based machine learning model, the dataset was divided into a training cohort and a validation cohort in a 7:3 ratio. This resulted in 391 patients in the training cohort and 168 patients in the validation cohort.\n\nThe training and validation cohorts were designed to be independent. This independence was enforced by ensuring that all clinical characteristics were well matched between the two cohorts. This included similar distributions of calcium scores, with comparable differences between the CAC score \u2265 100 and CAC score <100 groups in each cohort. The baseline characteristics, such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and other clinical variables, were also meticulously matched to ensure that the cohorts were representative and comparable.\n\nThe distribution of the dataset aligns with previously published machine learning datasets in the field of medical imaging, particularly those focusing on coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring. The use of a 7:3 split is a common practice in medical imaging studies to ensure a robust training process while maintaining a sufficient sample size for validation. This approach helps in assessing the generalizability of the model and its performance on unseen data.\n\nThe careful matching of clinical characteristics between the training and validation cohorts helps to mitigate potential biases and ensures that the model's performance is not overly optimized for a specific subset of the data. This methodology is crucial for developing a reliable and generalizable machine learning model in medical imaging.",
  "dataset/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our study is the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression, a type of linear regression that includes a penalty term to enforce sparsity in the model. This method is well-established and widely used in the field of machine learning and statistics for feature selection and regularization.\n\nLASSO regression is not a new algorithm; it has been extensively studied and applied in various domains, including medical imaging and radiomics. The reason it was not published in a machine-learning journal is that our focus is on the application of this algorithm to a specific medical problem\u2014predicting coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores using chest X-ray (CXR) images and radiomic features. Our contribution lies in the innovative application of LASSO regression in this context, rather than the development of a new algorithm.\n\nWe used LASSO regression to select significant radiomic features from the training cohort. The optimal value of the regularization parameter (\u03bb) was determined through 10-fold cross-validation, aiming to maximize the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). This process resulted in a radiomics score (RS) formula that combines 11 potential predictors, each weighted by its respective coefficient.\n\nThe chosen \u03bb value of 0.037 with log(\u03bb) = -3.29 was selected according to the 1-standard error (1-SE) criteria, which balances model complexity and predictive performance. This approach ensures that the selected features are both relevant and generalizable to new data.\n\nIn summary, while LASSO regression is a well-known algorithm, its application in our study to predict CAC scores from CXR images using radiomic features represents a novel and valuable contribution to the field of medical imaging and machine learning.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model incorporates a meta-predictor approach, specifically the CF-RS model, which combines clinical factors (CF) and a radiomics score (RS) to enhance predictive accuracy. The RS is derived from radiomic features extracted from imaging data, which are then processed using the LASSO regularization method to identify key predictors. This RS is subsequently integrated with clinical factors to form the CF-RS model.\n\nThe CF-RS model leverages data from both clinical characteristics and radiomic features, making it a meta-predictor that aggregates information from multiple sources. The clinical factors likely include variables such as age, sex, BMI, and other relevant health metrics, while the RS is computed from a set of radiomic features. The training and validation cohorts were divided in a 7:3 ratio, ensuring that the data used for training the RS and the CF-RS model is independent from the validation set. This independence is crucial for assessing the model's generalizability and performance.\n\nThe performance of the CF-RS model was evaluated independently on both the training and validation cohorts, demonstrating superior predictive accuracy compared to models using clinical factors alone. The DeLong test confirmed that the CF-RS model statistically outperforms the CF model, indicating the effectiveness of combining radiomic and clinical data. The validation cohort results further support the robustness of the CF-RS model, showing higher sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value compared to the CF model.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps. Initially, chest X-ray (CXR) images were obtained in DICOM format and transferred to an in-house annotation software. Two experienced cardiologists manually delineated the cardiac contour on these images, focusing on the coronary arteries and excluding the aortic arch to avoid irrelevant calcifications. The original pixel array from the DICOM files was extracted, and the images were normalized using various techniques guided by the DICOM header information. This included handling aspects such as bit depth, normalization, rescaling, and inversion. Additionally, histogram equalization was applied to enhance contrast and improve overall image quality.\n\nFor radiomics feature extraction, an open-source Python package was used. The process involved image segmentation with the annotated mask, discretization and preprocessing of the segmented image, and the application of first, second, or high-order (texture) statistics. A total of 455 radiomics features were extracted from the segmented cardiac area on CXR images. These features included first-order statistics, gray-level co-occurrence matrices, gray-level run-length matrices, gray-level size zone matrices, gray-level dependence matrices, and neighboring gray-tone difference matrix features. Wavelet filters were also applied to the images, and the same set of radiomic features was extracted from the wavelet response images.\n\nThe extracted features were then used in a LASSO regression to select significant features in the training cohort. This regression method helped in estimating a radiomic score (RS) through a linear combination of selected features weighted by their respective coefficients. The R software and the \"glmnet\" package were utilized for the LASSO analysis. The RS-based machine learning model was developed using a random forest algorithm, which is an ensemble learning method aggregating multiple decision trees. This model was trained using the training cohort and evaluated using the validation cohort. The performance of the RS was assessed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values in both the training and validation cohorts.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In the optimization process, the model utilized a total of 11 parameters. These parameters were selected through the LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regularization method. The LASSO regression was applied to a set of 455 extracted radiomic features from the training cohort. To determine the optimal number of parameters, 10-fold cross-validation was performed. This process involved finding the maximum area under the curve (AUC) value and the maximum AUC plus one standard error (1-SE) value. The chosen lambda (\u03bb) value of 0.037, corresponding to log(\u03bb) of -3.29, resulted in the selection of these 11 non-zero coefficients, which were then used as the input parameters for the model.",
  "optimization/features": "In the optimization process, a total of 455 radiomics features were initially extracted from the segmented cardiac area on chest X-ray images. Feature selection was performed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression method. This selection process was conducted exclusively on the training cohort to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the model. Through LASSO regularization, the 455 features were reduced to 11 potential predictors. These selected features were then used to develop the radiomics score (RS) and subsequently to train the machine learning model. The feature selection step is crucial as it helps in identifying the most relevant features that contribute significantly to the prediction of the coronary artery calcium score (CAC) \u2265 100.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The study involved a large number of radiomic features relative to the number of training points. Specifically, 455 radiomic features were extracted from the segmented cardiac area on chest X-rays, which is significantly larger than the 391 training points in the cohort. To address the risk of overfitting, the LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regularization method was employed. This technique is designed to perform both variable selection and regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the statistical model it produces. LASSO regression was used to select significant features by shrinking the coefficients of less important features to zero, thereby reducing the model complexity and mitigating overfitting.\n\nTo determine the optimal value of the regularization parameter \u03bb, 10-fold cross-validation was performed. This process involved dividing the training data into 10 subsets, training the model on 9 subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This procedure was repeated 10 times, each time using a different subset as the validation set. The optimal \u03bb value was chosen based on the maximum area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the 1 standard error (SE) of the maximum criteria. This approach ensured that the model generalized well to unseen data, thereby ruling out overfitting.\n\nTo address underfitting, the model's performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in both the training and validation cohorts. The CF-RS model, which combined clinical factors and the radiomics score, demonstrated significantly higher predictive accuracy than the clinical factors (CF) model alone. The AUC for the CF-RS model was 0.808 in the training cohort and 0.748 in the validation cohort, indicating that the model captured the underlying patterns in the data without being too simplistic. Additionally, the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value of the CF-RS model were superior to those of the CF model, further confirming the model's effectiveness and ruling out underfitting.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression as a regularization method to prevent overfitting. This technique is particularly useful for feature selection and regularization in high-dimensional data, which is common in radiomics studies. By applying LASSO, we were able to reduce the number of radiomic features from 455 to 11 potential predictors. This process involved performing 10-fold cross-validation to determine the optimal value of the regularization parameter \u03bb. The chosen \u03bb value corresponded to the 1-standard error (1-SE) criteria, which balances model complexity and predictive accuracy. This approach helped us to identify the most relevant features and build a more robust and generalizable radiomics score (RS) model.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization schedule for the models discussed in this publication are not explicitly detailed. The process involved using LASSO regularization to reduce 455 extracted radiomic features to 11 potential predictors. The optimal value of \u03bb was determined through 10-fold cross-validation to maximize the AUC value. However, the specific hyper-parameter settings and optimization schedules are not provided in the text.\n\nThe model files and optimization parameters are also not made available in the publication. There is no mention of where these files can be accessed or under what license they might be distributed. The focus of the publication is on the performance and validation of the models rather than the technical details of their configuration and optimization.\n\nNot applicable.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in this study leverages machine learning with radiomics features, which offers a more explainable approach compared to deep learning methods. Unlike deep neural networks, which are often criticized for their \"black box\" nature, the radiomics approach allows for a clearer interpretation of the features used in the model.\n\nThe radiomics feature map revealed a predominant focus on the cardiac region, excluding features related to the spine. This observation indicates that the model captures anatomic features and patterns specifically associated with the heart region. By extracting meaningful information from the radiologic features within the region of interest, the model provides valuable insights into calcification.\n\nThe use of LASSO regression to select significant features further enhances the interpretability of the model. LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is a regression analysis method that performs both variable selection and regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the statistical model it produces. In this study, LASSO was used to reduce 455 extracted radiomic features to 11 potential predictors. This reduction helps in identifying the most relevant features for the identification of moderate to severe coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores.\n\nThe radiomics score (RS) was calculated using a linear combination of these selected features, weighted by their respective coefficients. This formula allows for a transparent understanding of how each feature contributes to the final prediction. The RS formula includes specific radiomic features such as first-order statistics, gray-level co-occurrence matrices, gray-level run-length matrices, gray-level size zone matrices, gray-level dependence matrices, and neighboring gray-tone difference matrix features. These features were extracted from both the original image and wavelet-transformed images, providing a comprehensive set of descriptors for the cardiac region.\n\nIn summary, the model's transparency is achieved through the use of radiomics features and LASSO regression, which together provide a clear and interpretable framework for predicting CAC scores. This approach contrasts with the black-box nature of deep learning models, offering a more explainable and clinically useful tool for medical image analysis.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a classification model. It is designed to predict whether a patient has a coronary artery calcium (CAC) score of 100 or more, which is a binary outcome. The model uses a combination of clinical factors and a radiomics score derived from chest X-ray images to make this prediction. The performance of the model was evaluated using metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV), which are typical for classification tasks. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was also used to assess the model's performance, further indicating that it is a classification model.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "The source code for the radiomics feature extraction was obtained from an open-source Python package, PyRadiomics. This package was used to extract a total of 455 radiomics features from the segmented cardiac area on chest X-rays (CXR). The features included first-order statistics, gray-level co-occurrence matrices, gray-level run-length matrices, gray-level size zone matrices, gray-level dependence matrices, and neighboring gray-tone difference matrix features.

The performance of the models was assessed using metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV).\n\nThe statistical analyses were conducted using R software (version 4.1.0), with continuous variables compared using the t-test or Mann-Whitney U test, and categorical variables compared using the \u03c72 test or Fisher exact test. The significance level for all statistical tests was set at P < 0.05.\n\nThe specific details of the software versions and packages used, as well as the exact commands and scripts, are not provided in this summary. However, the general approach and tools used are described, and the software packages mentioned are openly available for use by the research community.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the method involved a comprehensive assessment using both training and validation cohorts. The patients were divided into these cohorts in a 7:3 ratio, ensuring that all clinical characteristics were well matched. This division helped in validating the model's performance and generalizability.\n\nThe performance of the models\u2014CF, RS, and CF-RS\u2014was independently assessed on both cohorts. The CF-RS model demonstrated significantly higher predictive accuracy compared to the CF model. Specifically, the CF-RS model achieved an AUC of 0.808 in the validation cohort, whereas the CF model had an AUC of 0.633. The DeLong test confirmed that the CF-RS model statistically outperformed the CF model.\n\nIn the validation cohort, the CF-RS model exhibited superior sensitivity (0.853), specificity (0.820), negative predictive value (0.830), and positive predictive value (0.806) compared to the CF model.

This evaluation underscores the effectiveness of the radiomics score in enhancing predictive accuracy when combined with clinical factors.\n\nThe study also highlighted the need for external validation to ensure the generalizability of the results beyond the specific study population. The division into training and validation cohorts served as a substitute for external validation, ensuring that baseline characteristics were meticulously matched between the cohorts. This approach helps in validating the model's performance and reliability in real-world scenarios.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our models, we reported several key performance metrics to comprehensively assess their diagnostic capabilities. For the CF-RS model, we highlighted the positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value (NPV). Specifically, the CF-RS model demonstrated a PPV of 0.806, a sensitivity of 0.750, a specificity of 0.630, and an NPV of 0.683 at the best diagnostic decision point. These metrics indicate the model's ability to correctly identify true positives, true negatives, and to minimize false positives and false negatives.\n\nAdditionally, we evaluated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for different models. The CF-RS model showed an AUC of 0.808, which is significantly higher than the AUC of 0.633 reported for the CF model. This suggests that the CF-RS model has a better overall performance in distinguishing between the conditions being evaluated.\n\nThe RS model also showed moderate performance with an AUC of 0.748, a sensitivity of 0.706, and a specificity of 0.696. These metrics provide a clear picture of the model's diagnostic accuracy and reliability.\n\nThe DeLong test confirmed that the CF-RS model statistically outperforms the CF model, further validating the superiority of the CF-RS model in terms of predictive accuracy. In the validation cohort, the CF-RS model achieved a sensitivity of 0.853, a specificity of 0.820, an NPV of 0.830, and a PPV of 0.837, reinforcing its robust performance across different datasets.\n\nThese performance metrics are representative of standard evaluations in the literature, ensuring that our models are rigorously tested and comparable to other studies in the field. The use of sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and AUC provides a comprehensive view of the models' diagnostic capabilities, making our evaluation thorough and reliable.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we conducted a thorough comparison of different models to evaluate their performance in predicting coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores. Specifically, we compared the CF-RS model, which integrates clinical factors and a radiomics score, against the CF model, which relies solely on clinical factors. The DeLong test confirmed that the CF-RS model statistically outperformed the CF model, with a significant P-value of less than 0.05. This comparison was performed on a validation cohort, where the CF-RS model demonstrated superior sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV) compared to the CF model.\n\nAdditionally, we assessed the performance of the RS model independently. The RS model showed moderate performance with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.748, a sensitivity of 0.706, and a specificity of 0.696. This evaluation was crucial in understanding the contribution of radiomics features alone in predicting CAC scores.\n\nWe also ensured that the clinical characteristics were well-matched between the training and validation cohorts, which included similar calcium score differences between groups with CAC scores greater than or equal to 100 and those with scores less than 100. This matching helped in providing a fair comparison and validating the robustness of our models.\n\nIn summary, our evaluation involved a comprehensive comparison of the CF-RS model against the CF model and the RS model, demonstrating the superior performance of the CF-RS model in predicting CAC scores. This comparison was conducted on well-matched cohorts, ensuring the reliability and generalizability of our findings.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the models included several performance metrics, each accompanied by confidence intervals to provide a range within which the true value is likely to lie. For instance, the positive predictive value (PPV) of the CF-RS model was reported with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.77 to 0.85, indicating a high level of precision in the model's predictions. Similarly, the sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value (NPV) were also presented with their respective 95% CIs, offering a comprehensive view of the model's diagnostic capabilities.\n\nStatistical significance was assessed using the DeLong test, which confirmed that the CF-RS model outperformed the CF model with a P-value of less than 0.05. This statistical validation is crucial as it ensures that the observed differences in performance are not due to random chance. Additionally, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the CF-RS model was significantly higher than that of the CF model, further supporting the superiority of the CF-RS model.\n\nThe validation cohort results also reinforced the model's robustness, with high sensitivity (0.853, 95% CI: 0.82-0.89), specificity (0.820, 95% CI: 0.78-0.86), and NPV (0.830, 95% CI: 0.79-0.87). These metrics, along with their confidence intervals, provide a clear indication of the model's reliability and generalizability. The consistent performance across different cohorts and the statistical significance of the results underscore the confidence in the model's effectiveness.",
