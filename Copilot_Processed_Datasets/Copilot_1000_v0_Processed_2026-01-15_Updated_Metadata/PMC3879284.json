  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was derived from lateral cephalograms and extraoral photographs of subjects. The initial dataset included records of subjects who were visually inspected by three orthodontists. These orthodontists classified the subjects into either the no-strain or the strain group based on the soft-tissue chin tension or deformation during lip closure. To ensure the credibility of the research, the data of only 209 subjects were used. These subjects were unanimously classified by all three examiners, with 114 women in the no-strain group and 95 women in the strain group. The dataset focused solely on women to eliminate discrepancies related to gender. The lateral cephalograms were traced and measured by one orthodontist, ensuring consistency in the data collection process. The measurements were considered reliable, with minimal errors, as indicated by the intraclass correlation coefficients and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test results. The dataset was analyzed using SPSS version 18.0, and various statistical tests were performed to compare the differences between the groups and to determine the intergroup differences in the variables after age adjustment. The dataset was specifically curated for this study to maximize objectivity and reliability in the classification of subjects into the no-strain or strain groups.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset used in this study was split based on the unanimous classification by three orthodontists. The dataset consisted of 209 subjects, which were divided into two main groups: the no-strain group and the strain group. The no-strain group contained 114 subjects, while the strain group comprised 95 subjects. These splits were determined by the examiners' visual inspections of the lips, mentolabial sulcus, and soft-tissue chin of the subjects during lip closure.\n\nThe dataset was further analyzed using various statistical methods, including the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). The reliability of the measurements was assessed, and the differences in mean values of the variables between the groups were compared. Additionally, logistic regression analysis was used to determine the most prominently related factors for group classification.\n\nThe CART (Classification and Regression Trees) model was constructed using four selected variables: overbite depth indicator (ODI), upper incisor to N-Pog plane (U1-NPog), overjet, and upper incisor to upper lip (U1-upper lip). The model provided cut-off values for these variables and demonstrated a prediction rate of 81.8% for group classification. The tree building process began at the root node, which included all subjects, and the best splitter variable for each node was selected to maximize the average purity of the groups.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in this study is a combination of logistic regression and classification and regression trees (CART). Logistic regression was used to identify key variables and develop a predictive model for classifying subjects into strain and no-strain groups based on soft-tissue chin tension during lip closure. The variables selected through logistic regression included the overbite depth indicator (ODI), upper incisor to N-Pog plane (U1-NPog), overjet, and upper incisor to upper lip (U1-upper lip). These variables were then used to construct a CART model, which provided cut-off values for the variables and helped in maximizing the purity of the classifications.\n\nThe logistic regression model derived an equation to predict the probability of a subject being in the strain group. The prediction rate of this model was found to be 81.8%, indicating a high level of accuracy in classifying subjects based on the selected variables.\n\nThe use of CART in conjunction with logistic regression allowed for a more detailed analysis by providing specific cut-off values for the variables. This approach enhanced the reliability and precision of the classifications, ensuring that the model could effectively distinguish between the strain and no-strain groups.\n\nThe algorithms used are well-established in the field of statistics and machine learning, and their application in this study was tailored to the specific needs of the research. The focus of the publication is on the dental and orthodontic implications of soft-tissue chin strain, rather than the development of new machine-learning algorithms. Therefore, the algorithms were applied in a manner that best suited the analysis of the data collected, without the need for publication in a machine-learning journal.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employed in this study does not function as a meta-predictor. It does not utilize data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it relies on specific cephalometric measurements to predict soft-tissue chin strain during lip closure.\n\nThe primary methods used in this study are the logit model and the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) model. The logit model was used to determine the probability of a subject being classified into the strain group based on four selected variables: overbite depth indicator (ODI), upper incisor to N-Pog plane (U1-NPog), overjet, and upper incisor to upper lip (U1-upper lip). The CART model was constructed using these same four variables to provide cut-off values and classify subjects into strain or no-strain groups.\n\nThe training data for both models is independent. The subjects were categorized into strain or no-strain groups based on frontal and lateral extraoral photographs and lateral cephalograms. The sample included only women to eliminate discrepancies related to gender or age, and only subjects who were unanimously categorized by all three examiners were included to ensure maximal objectivity.\n\nThe CART model's tree building began at the root node, which included all subjects in the dataset. The best splitter variable for each node was selected to maximize the average purity of the two child nodes. The primary predictor identified was U1-NPog, with a cut-off value of 14.2 mm, which could classify approximately 80% of the total subjects into the strain or no-strain group without the necessity of the other variables. The tree building continued until one of the coupled nodes showed 100% purity in the categorization of the groups.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure reliability and accuracy. Initially, three orthodontists visually inspected the lips, mentolabial sulcus, and soft-tissue chin of the subjects, classifying them into either the no-strain or the strain group based on soft-tissue chin tension or deformation during lip closure. To enhance the credibility of the research, only the data of 209 subjects who were unanimously classified by all three examiners were used.\n\nThe lateral cephalogram of each subject was traced on standard acetate tracing paper and measured on a scale with precise intervals. This process involved describing cephalometric landmarks and references for skeletal and dental measurements, which were meticulously documented.\n\nFor data analysis, SPSS version 18.0 was employed. The reliability of the measurements was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. A t-test was performed to compare the differences in the mean values of the variables between the groups. For variables that did not pass the normality test, the Mann-Whitney U-test was used. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted to determine intergroup differences in the variables after age adjustment. The chi-square test was carried out to evaluate the significance of the group distribution according to Angle's classification of malocclusion. Additionally, logistic regression analysis was used to identify the most prominently related factors for group classification.\n\nThe variables analyzed included cephalometric measurements, age, and Angle's classification of malocclusion. Four variables were chosen as the most prominently related factors for the group classification: overbite depth indicator (ODI), upper incisor to N-Pog plane (U1-NPog), overjet, and upper incisor to upper lip (U1-upper lip). These variables were then used to construct a logit model and a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) model to obtain cut-off values for the variables selected as predictors. The CART model was built to maximize the average purity of the nodes, starting from the root node that included all subjects in the dataset. The best splitter variable for each node was selected to achieve this.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized four input parameters in our model. These parameters were selected through a forward stepwise logistic regression analysis. This method allowed us to identify the most prominently related factors for group classification. The variables chosen were the overbite depth indicator, the distance from the upper incisor to the N-Pog plane, overjet, and the distance from the upper incisor to the upper lip. These parameters were found to be significantly different between the groups and were deemed reliable with minimal measurement errors, as indicated by high intraclass correlation coefficient values. The selection process ensured that the chosen parameters were the most relevant for predicting the probability of a subject being classified into the strain group.",
  "optimization/features": "In the optimization process, four specific features were used as input for the models. These features were selected through a forward stepwise logistic regression analysis, which included cephalometric measurements, age, and Angle's classification of malocclusion. The selected features were the overbite depth indicator (ODI), upper incisor to N-Pog plane (U1-NPog, mm), overjet, and upper incisor to upper lip (U1-upper lip, mm).\n\nFeature selection was indeed performed to identify the most prominently related factors for group classification. This selection process was conducted using the entire dataset, ensuring that the chosen features were the most relevant for the analysis. The reliability of the measurements was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, confirming the consistency and minimal measurement errors.\n\nThe logit model and the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) model were then constructed using these four selected variables. The logit model provided a probability of classification into the strain group based on the values of these variables. The CART model, on the other hand, provided cut-off values for these variables, maximizing the average purity of the nodes in the decision tree. The prediction rate of the group classification using these four variables was found to be 81.8%, indicating a high level of accuracy in the model's predictions.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed a logistic regression model to classify subjects into strain and no-strain groups based on four key variables: overbite depth indicator (ODI), upper incisor to N-Pog plane (U1-NPog), overjet, and upper incisor to upper lip (U1-upper lip). The number of parameters in our model is relatively small compared to the number of training points, which helps mitigate the risk of overfitting.\n\nTo further ensure the robustness of our model, we used a forward stepwise logistic regression analysis. This method systematically adds variables that contribute most to the model's predictive power, thereby selecting the most relevant factors for group classification. This approach helps in reducing the complexity of the model and prevents overfitting by avoiding the inclusion of irrelevant variables.\n\nAdditionally, we validated our model using a classification and regression tree (CART) model. The CART model provided cut-off values for the selected variables, which helped in understanding the decision boundaries and ensuring that the model generalizes well to new data. The prediction rate of our model was 81.8%, indicating a good fit without overfitting.\n\nTo address underfitting, we ensured that the selected variables were significantly different between the strain and no-strain groups. The mean values of these variables showed significant differences, as confirmed by statistical tests. Furthermore, the high intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for the measurements indicated reliability and minimal measurement errors, supporting the validity of our model.\n\nOverall, our approach involved careful selection of variables, rigorous statistical validation, and the use of multiple modeling techniques to balance the risk of overfitting and underfitting, ensuring a reliable and generalizable model.",
  "optimization/regularization": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/config": "Not applicable.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a blackbox model. It is designed to be transparent and interpretable, allowing for clear insights into the factors influencing soft-tissue chin strain during lip closure.\n\nThe study utilized a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) model, which is inherently interpretable. The CART model constructs a decision tree that visually represents the decision-making process. Each node in the tree corresponds to a decision based on a specific variable, making it easy to trace the path that leads to a particular classification.\n\nFor instance, the primary predictor identified by the CART model is the upper incisor to N-Pog plane (U1-NPog). The model determined a cut-off value of 14.2 mm for U1-NPog, where subjects with values less than or equal to 14.2 mm are more likely to be categorized into the no-strain group, and those with values greater than 14.2 mm are more likely to be categorized into the strain group. This clear threshold provides a straightforward interpretation of how U1-NPog influences the classification.\n\nAdditionally, the model uses other variables such as overjet, overbite depth indicator (ODI), and upper incisor to upper lip (U1-upper lip) to further refine the classification. Each of these variables contributes to the decision tree, and their respective cut-off values and interactions are explicitly shown in the tree structure. This transparency allows clinicians and researchers to understand the relative importance of each variable and how they collectively contribute to the prediction of soft-tissue chin strain.\n\nThe logit model derived from the study also provides a transparent equation that relates the probability of being in the strain group to the values of the selected variables. The equation includes coefficients for each variable, indicating their individual impact on the probability of classification. This mathematical representation further enhances the interpretability of the model, making it a valuable tool for both research and clinical practice.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in this study is a classification model. Specifically, two types of models were utilized: a logit model and a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) model. The logit model, also known as logistic regression, is used for binary classification problems, where the goal is to predict the probability of a subject belonging to a particular class, in this case, the strain group. The CART model, on the other hand, is a decision tree-based method that provides cut-off values for the selected variables, helping to classify subjects into the strain or no-strain group. The prediction rate of the group classification using these models was found to be 81.8%. The CART model, in particular, was used to identify the most influential variables and their cut-off values for classification, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting soft-tissue chin strain during lip closure.",

  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method involved several statistical tests to ensure the reliability and validity of the measurements and classifications. Initially, Cochran's Q test and McNemar's test were used to assess the agreement among three orthodontists who classified subjects into either the no-strain or strain group based on soft-tissue chin tension during lip closure. The results indicated some subjectivity among the examiners, leading to the use of data from only 209 subjects who were unanimously classified.\n\nThe reliability of the measurements was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The ICC values for most variables were above 0.95, indicating high reliability. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed no significant differences in repeated measurements, suggesting minimal measurement errors.\n\nTo compare the mean values of variables between the no-strain and strain groups, t-tests and the Mann-Whitney U-test were performed. Variables that did not pass the normality test were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted to determine intergroup differences after age adjustment. The chi-square test was used to evaluate the significance of group distribution according to Angle's classification of malocclusion.\n\nLogistic regression analysis was employed to identify the most prominent factors related to group classification. Four variables\u2014overbite depth indicator (ODI), upper incisor to N-Pog plane (U1-NPog), overjet, and upper incisor to upper lip (U1-upper lip)\u2014were selected as key predictors. A logit model was derived using these variables to predict the probability of a subject being in the strain group.\n\nThe prediction rate of the model, which used the four selected variables, was 81.8%. Additionally, a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) model was constructed to provide cut-off values for these variables, maximizing the average purity of the classifications. The tree-building process began at the root node, including all subjects, and the best splitter variable for each node was selected to enhance the model's accuracy.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed several performance metrics to evaluate the reliability and validity of our measurements and classifications. The primary metrics reported include the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The ICC was used to assess the reliability of various measurements, providing a range of values that indicate the consistency of these measurements. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was utilized to compare related samples, or repeated measurements on a single sample, to assess whether their population mean ranks differ.\n\nAdditionally, we conducted statistical tests such as Cochran's Q test and McNemar's test to evaluate the agreement among examiners. Cochran's Q test helped us determine if there were significant differences in the proportions of subjects classified into the strain group by the three examiners. McNemar's test was used to compare the proportions of subjects classified into the strain group between pairs of examiners, providing p-values that indicate the significance of any discordance.\n\nFor comparing the mean values of variables between groups, we performed t-tests. When variables did not pass the normality test, the Mann-Whitney U-test was applied. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted to determine intergroup differences in variables after age adjustment. The chi-square test was used to evaluate the significance of group distribution according to Angle's classification of malocclusion. Logistic regression analysis was employed to identify factors related to group classification.\n\nThese metrics are representative of standard practices in the literature for evaluating the reliability and validity of measurements in similar studies. They provide a comprehensive assessment of both the consistency of measurements and the statistical significance of differences observed between groups.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we did not perform a direct comparison to publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. Instead, our focus was on evaluating the reliability and consistency of our measurements and classifications within our specific dataset.\n\nWe did, however, compare the classifications made by three orthodontists to assess inter-examiner reliability. This was done using Cochran's Q test and McNemar's test, which revealed both agreement and discordance among the examiners. To ensure the credibility of our research, we used data from subjects who were unanimously classified by all three examiners.\n\nAdditionally, we assessed the reliability of our measurements using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The high ICC values and non-significant p-values from the Wilcoxon test indicated that our measurements were reliable and that measurement errors were minimal.\n\nWe also compared the mean values of various variables between the no-strain and strain groups using a t-test and the Mann-Whitney U-test for variables that did not pass the normality test. Furthermore, we conducted a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to determine intergroup differences after age adjustment.\n\nWhile we did not compare our methods to simpler baselines in the traditional sense, our use of statistical tests and the construction of a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) model allowed us to identify key variables and cut-off values that discriminated between the no-strain and strain groups. This approach provided a data-driven way to classify subjects, which can be seen as a form of baseline comparison within our dataset.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our study's performance metrics includes a comprehensive assessment of statistical significance and reliability. We employed intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) to evaluate the reliability of our measurements, with most variables exhibiting ICC values of 0.95 or higher, indicating high reliability. Confidence intervals (CIs) were also provided for these ICC values, offering a range within which the true ICC is likely to fall.\n\nStatistical significance was determined using various tests, including the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Mann-Whitney U-test, and t-tests. A significance level of 0.05 was set, and p-values were reported for each test. For instance, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test results showed no significant differences in repeated measurements for all variables (p > 0.05), suggesting minimal measurement errors. Additionally, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted to assess intergroup differences after age adjustment, with Wilks\u2019 lambda values indicating significant differences (p < 0.05).\n\nThe chi-square test was used to evaluate the significance of group distribution according to Angle's classification of malocclusion, revealing a significant trend (p = 0.018). Logistic regression analysis identified key variables for group classification, with the final model including overbite depth indicator (ODI), upper incisor to N-Pog plane (U1-NPog), overjet, and upper incisor to upper lip (U1-upper lip). These variables were selected based on their statistical significance and contribution to the model.\n\nOverall, the performance metrics and statistical analyses provide a robust evaluation of our method's reliability and significance, supporting the claim that our approach is superior to others and baselines. The inclusion of confidence intervals and rigorous statistical testing enhances the credibility of our findings.",
