  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from the Finnish Arthroplasty Register (FAR). This register was thoroughly revised in 2014 to include new variables that offer the possibility to model and estimate the risk of revision using versatile data on the primary operation.\n\nThe initial dataset contained information on 33,337 primary total hip arthroplasties (THAs) performed in Finland between May 2014 and January 2018. For the present study, all operations with a minimum follow-up time of at least 6 months or resulting in a revision surgical procedure or death within the first 6 postoperative months were included. This left us with 25,919 primary THAs performed during the study period. For model training and validation, the data was randomly divided into a separate training cohort (17,279 THAs) and an independent test cohort (8,640 THAs). The patients in each cohort were unique, and no crossover of data was allowed at any stage of the model development and validation.\n\nThe dataset included both patient demographic characteristics (e.g., age, sex, and body mass index [BMI]) and surgical variables (e.g., type of fixation, anesthesia, and bearing used). A complete list of all candidate predictors can be found in Appendix 1. The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification was tested both as categorical and numerical variables but was eventually selected to be treated as a numerical variable because of the improved model performance.\n\nThe dataset has been used in previous studies, such as the one that analyzed 33,337 operations from the Finnish Arthroplasty Register to identify factors associated with increased risk of revision for dislocation after total hip arthroplasty. The dataset's comprehensiveness and the inclusion of various patient and surgical variables make it a valuable resource for developing and validating risk prediction models in the context of total hip arthroplasty.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into two main splits: a training cohort and a test cohort. The training cohort consisted of 17,279 data points, while the test cohort had 8,640 data points. This division allowed for the development and evaluation of the risk prediction models. The training cohort was used to construct the models, while the test cohort was used to assess their performance. The distribution of outcomes within these cohorts was similar, ensuring that the models could be validated effectively. For instance, in the training cohort, 1.2% of the cases involved revisions due to periprosthetic joint infection, compared to 1.1% in the test cohort. This consistency helped in evaluating the models' generalizability and reliability.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset used in this study was split into training and test cohorts using a commonly applied ratio of 2:1. This means that two-thirds of the data were allocated to the training cohort, while the remaining one-third formed the test cohort. The training cohort consisted of 17,279 primary total hip arthroplasties (THAs), and the test cohort included 8,640 primary THAs. This split was performed randomly, ensuring that each cohort contained unique patients with no crossover of data at any stage of model development and validation. This approach helps to maintain the independence of the training and test sets, which is crucial for evaluating the generalizability and performance of the risk prediction models. The distribution of the data in this study is consistent with standard practices in machine learning, where a significant portion of the data is used for training the models, and a smaller, independent portion is reserved for testing their performance.",
  "dataset/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used is penalized logistic regression, specifically with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) penalty. This method is well-established and widely used for creating risk models, particularly when the number of events is low compared to the number of predictors.\n\nThe Lasso penalty is applied to perform variable selection, and the amount of penalty is determined by maximizing prediction accuracy through fivefold cross-validation. To account for variability due to random subsampling during cross-validation, the process is repeated 100 times. This approach ensures robust variable selection and model stability.\n\nThe use of Lasso penalized logistic regression is not new; it is a standard technique in statistical modeling and machine learning. The choice to use this method in this context is driven by its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data and its ability to provide interpretable models. The focus of the study is on developing risk prediction models for specific medical outcomes, rather than introducing a novel machine-learning algorithm. Therefore, the method is appropriately applied within the scope of the research without the need for publication in a machine-learning journal.",
  "optimization/meta": "The models developed in this study do not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, they rely on patient demographic characteristics and surgical variables. These variables include age, sex, body mass index (BMI), type of fixation, anesthesia, bearing used, and the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification, among others.\n\nThe primary method used for model development is penalized logistic regression, specifically with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) penalty. This approach is effective for creating simple-to-use risk models when the number of events is low compared to the number of predictors. The variable selection process involved fivefold cross-validation repeated 100 times to account for the effect of random subsampling and resulting model variability.\n\nThe training and test cohorts were created using a commonly used split ratio of 2:1, ensuring that the data in each cohort were unique and that there was no crossover of data at any stage of model development and validation. This approach helps to ensure that the training data is independent, providing a robust evaluation of the model's performance.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the machine-learning algorithm, the data encoding and preprocessing involved several steps to ensure the data was suitable for model training. The candidate predictors included both patient demographic characteristics and surgical variables. These predictors were initially considered as either categorical or numerical variables. For instance, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification was tested in both forms but was ultimately treated as a numerical variable due to improved model performance.\n\nThe data preprocessing also addressed missing values. Among all candidate predictors, the body mass index (BMI) had the highest number of missing values, with 10.8% of primary total hip arthroplasties (THAs) lacking this information. Instead of performing multiple imputations, the analysis was restricted to the subset of patients with complete information on all candidate variables. This approach ensured that the penalized regression algorithm, which requires complete data, could be applied effectively.\n\nVariable selection was performed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) penalty. This method is particularly useful when the number of events is low compared to the number of predictors, as it helps in creating simple-to-use risk models. The amount of penalty applied to the coefficients was determined by maximizing the prediction accuracy estimated using fivefold cross-validation. To account for the effect of random subsampling during cross-validation and resulting model variability, the cross-validation process was repeated 100 times. This iterative approach helped in stabilizing the variable selection and ensuring the robustness of the final model.\n\nThe final models were constructed and evaluated using THAs with complete data on the variables identified as important by the iterative feature selection procedure. This ensured that the models were based on reliable and complete datasets, enhancing their predictive accuracy and generalizability.",
  "optimization/parameters": "The model utilized a variety of candidate predictors, encompassing both patient demographic characteristics and surgical variables. These included age, sex, body mass index (BMI), type of fixation, anesthesia, and bearing used, among others. The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification was initially tested as both categorical and numerical variables but was ultimately selected to be treated as a numerical variable due to improved model performance.\n\nTo construct the multivariable models, penalized logistic regression was applied to the patient and surgical data in the training cohort. The variable selection process employed the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) penalty. The amount of penalty applied to the coefficients was determined by maximizing the prediction accuracy estimated using fivefold cross-validation. This process was repeated 100 times to account for the effect of random subsampling during cross-validation and to mitigate model variability.\n\nThe final models were constructed and evaluated using total hip arthroplasties (THAs) with complete data on the variables identified as important by the iterative feature selection procedure. The Lasso penalized regression identified key variables for different outcomes, such as male sex, higher BMI, higher ASA classification, and the use of general anesthesia for periprosthetic joint infection. For dislocation prediction, additional factors included preoperative fracture diagnosis, previous contributing operations, 32-mm femoral head size, and posterior approach. For periprosthetic fracture, advanced age and cementless fixation were significant. For predicting the risk of death, advanced age and preoperative fracture diagnosis were important alongside the ASA classification.\n\nThe number of parameters (p) used in the model varied depending on the outcome being predicted, as different sets of variables were identified as key predictors for each outcome. The selection of p was driven by the Lasso penalty and cross-validation process, ensuring that the most relevant variables were included in the final models.",
  "optimization/features": "The study utilized a comprehensive set of candidate predictors to develop risk prediction models. These predictors included both patient demographic characteristics and surgical variables. The demographic characteristics encompassed factors such as age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). The surgical variables included aspects like the type of fixation, anesthesia used, and the bearing employed during the procedure. The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification was initially tested as both categorical and numerical variables but was ultimately selected to be treated as a numerical variable due to improved model performance.\n\nFeature selection was performed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) penalty within the penalized logistic regression framework. This process was conducted on the training cohort to ensure that the model's performance was optimized and to mitigate overfitting. The variable selection was repeated 100 times using fivefold cross-validation to account for the effect of random subsampling and resulting model variability. This iterative process helped in identifying the most relevant features for predicting the outcomes of interest.\n\nThe final models were constructed and evaluated using the subset of patients with complete data on the variables identified as important by the iterative feature selection procedure. This approach ensured that the models were robust and generalizable to new data. The number of features used as input varied depending on the specific outcome being predicted, but the Lasso penalty method ensured that only the most relevant features were included in the final models.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The study utilized penalized logistic regression to construct multivariable models for predicting the individualized risk of revision or death after total hip arthroplasty (THA). This method is particularly effective when the number of events is low compared to the number of predictors, which was the case in this study.\n\nTo address the potential issue of overfitting, given the relatively low number of events, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) penalty was applied. This technique helps in variable selection by shrinking some coefficients to zero, effectively reducing the model complexity and preventing overfitting. The amount of penalty applied to the coefficients was determined by maximizing the prediction accuracy estimated using fivefold cross-validation. To further account for the effect of random subsampling during cross-validation and resulting model variability, the cross-validation process was repeated 100 times. This iterative approach ensured that the final variable selection was robust and not dependent on a single split of the data.\n\nRegarding underfitting, the use of Lasso regression helps in selecting the most relevant predictors, thereby avoiding a model that is too simplistic. The discrimination performance of the risk assessment models was evaluated and optimized in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). This metric provides a comprehensive measure of the model's ability to distinguish between high-risk and low-risk patients, ensuring that the model is neither too complex nor too simplistic.\n\nAdditionally, the models were constructed and evaluated using a subset of patients with complete data on all candidate variables, which further helped in maintaining the model's robustness and generalizability. The final models were then applied to the test cohort to validate their performance, ensuring that they generalize well to new, unseen data.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed penalized logistic regression to construct multivariable models for predicting the risk of revision or death. This method is particularly effective when the number of events is low compared to the number of predictors, which was the case in our dataset.\n\nTo prevent overfitting, we utilized the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) penalty. This technique helps in variable selection by shrinking some of the regression coefficients to zero, effectively performing both variable selection and regularization. The amount of penalty applied to the coefficients was determined by maximizing the prediction accuracy estimated using fivefold cross-validation. To account for the variability introduced by random subsampling during cross-validation, we repeated the cross-validation process 100 times. This iterative approach ensured that our final variable selection was robust and not dependent on a single split of the data.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization schedule used in our study are not explicitly detailed in the provided information. However, the methodology for model development and statistical analysis is thoroughly described. We employed penalized logistic regression with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) penalty for variable selection. The amount of penalty applied to the coefficients was determined by maximizing the prediction accuracy estimated using fivefold cross-validation, repeated 100 times to account for the effect of random subsampling.\n\nThe specific model files and optimization parameters are not made available in the provided information. The statistical analyses and mathematical modeling were performed using the R statistical computing environment, with packages such as glmnet for penalized regression, survival for survival analysis, ggplot2 for visualization, and pROC for evaluating AUROC values. These packages are widely used and documented, and their usage is standard in the field of statistical modeling.\n\nRegarding the availability and licensing of the configurations and parameters, the study does not provide direct links or repositories for the specific configurations used. However, the methods and tools mentioned are open-source and freely available for use by the research community. The study was published in an open-access journal, which ensures that the methodology and findings are accessible to anyone interested in replicating or building upon the work.",
  "model/interpretability": "The models developed in this study are not black-box but rather transparent and interpretable. The use of penalized logistic regression with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) penalty ensures that the models are simple and easy to understand. The Lasso penalty helps in selecting the most important variables by shrinking the coefficients of less important variables to zero, thereby reducing the complexity of the model.\n\nThe final models include a limited number of key variables that significantly influence the risk of adverse outcomes. For instance, the model for predicting the risk of revision due to periprosthetic joint infection includes variables such as male sex, higher BMI, higher ASA classification, and the use of general anesthesia. Each of these variables has a clear and interpretable effect on the risk, making it straightforward for clinicians to understand how different factors contribute to the overall risk.\n\nSimilarly, the model for predicting the risk of dislocation includes variables like ASA classification, preoperative fracture diagnosis, previous contributing operations, femoral head size, and the surgical approach. These variables are all clinically relevant and their inclusion in the model provides a clear rationale for the predicted risk.\n\nThe transparency of the models is further enhanced by the use of regression coefficients, which allow for the calculation of individualized risk scores. The raw risk estimates are calculated as a sum of patient-specific risk factors weighted by the regression coefficients. This approach provides a clear and interpretable way to estimate the risk for each patient, based on their specific characteristics and surgical variables.\n\nMoreover, the models stratify patients into low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk subgroups based on the tertiles of the risk score distribution. This stratification helps in visualizing the risk distribution and understanding the relative risk for different patient groups. The use of Cox proportional hazards regression and Kaplan-Meier plots for survival analysis also adds to the interpretability of the models by providing a visual comparison of time to event between the groups.\n\nIn summary, the models developed in this study are transparent and interpretable, with a clear focus on clinically relevant variables. This transparency makes the models useful for clinical decision-making, as they provide clear and actionable insights into the risk of adverse outcomes for individual patients.",
  "model/output": "The model developed is a classification model, specifically designed to predict the risk of adverse outcomes after primary total hip arthroplasty (THA). It uses penalized logistic regression, which is a type of logistic regression that includes a penalty term to prevent overfitting, particularly useful when the number of predictors is large compared to the number of events. The model outputs individualized risk scores for each patient, which can be used to stratify patients into low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk subgroups based on the tertiles of the risk score distribution. These risk scores are calculated as the inverse logit of the sum of the model intercept and the raw risk score, which is a weighted sum of patient-specific risk factors. The model's performance is evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), with higher values indicating better discrimination performance. The final models were constructed and evaluated using patients with complete data on the variables identified as important by the iterative feature selection procedure.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method for the risk prediction models involved several key steps to ensure robustness and accuracy. Penalized logistic regression was applied to patient and surgical data within a training cohort, utilizing the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) penalty for variable selection. The amount of penalty applied to the coefficients was determined by maximizing prediction accuracy through fivefold cross-validation, repeated 100 times to account for variability. This process helped in stabilizing the Lasso against cross-validation variability and resulted in more reliable model performance.\n\nThe discrimination performance of the risk assessment models was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). This metric provided a measure of how well the models could distinguish between high-risk and low-risk patients for the outcomes of interest.\n\nPatients were stratified into low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk subgroups based on the tertiles of the risk score distribution in the training cohort. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios, and Kaplan-Meier plots were employed for visual comparison of time to event between the groups.\n\nThe models were constructed and evaluated using a subset of patients with complete data on all candidate variables, ensuring that the final models were based on reliable and complete information. The performance of the models was assessed in both the training and test cohorts, with the model for death showing the highest discrimination performance in terms of AUROC. The other models reached moderate to good performance, with varying degrees of consistency between the training and test cohorts.",
  "evaluation/measure": "The performance of the developed risk prediction models was primarily evaluated using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC). This metric was chosen for its ability to provide a single scalar value that represents the overall performance of a binary classifier, regardless of the chosen classification threshold. The AUROC values were reported for both the training and test cohorts, allowing for an assessment of how well the models generalize to new, unseen data.\n\nThe AUROC metric is widely used in the literature for evaluating the performance of risk prediction models, particularly in medical and healthcare settings. It provides a comprehensive measure of a model's ability to discriminate between positive and negative cases, making it a suitable choice for comparing the performance of different models.\n\nIn addition to AUROC, the models' performance was also assessed by stratifying patients into different risk subgroups based on their estimated risk scores. This allowed for a more detailed analysis of the models' ability to identify patients at varying levels of risk. However, specific metrics related to this stratification, such as the number of patients in each risk subgroup or the event rates within these subgroups, were not explicitly reported.\n\nThe performance of the models was also discussed in terms of their ability to estimate more detailed trends in risk, even within certain risk subgroups. This suggests that the models may provide valuable insights into the risk profiles of individual patients, beyond simply classifying them as high or low risk.\n\nOverall, the use of AUROC as the primary performance metric is representative of the literature and provides a clear and concise measure of the models' discriminative ability. However, the lack of additional metrics, such as those related to calibration or clinical utility, may limit the comprehensiveness of the performance evaluation. Future work could consider incorporating these additional metrics to provide a more complete assessment of the models' performance.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "Not applicable. The study focused on developing and evaluating risk prediction models for specific outcomes after total hip arthroplasty (THA) using penalized logistic regression with Lasso penalty. The evaluation was primarily based on the performance of these models within the study's own datasets, specifically the training and test cohorts derived from a large, prospectively collected data set. The models were assessed using metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and were compared across different outcomes (e.g., periprosthetic joint infection, dislocation, periprosthetic fracture, and death). However, there was no explicit comparison to publicly available methods or simpler baselines on benchmark datasets. The study's strength lies in its large and versatile data set, but it did not engage in a direct comparison with external methods or baselines.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The performance metrics for the developed models include confidence intervals, providing a range within which the true performance is likely to fall. For instance, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for the death prediction model is reported with 95% confidence intervals, such as 0.82 [0.78 to 0.86] for the training cohort and 0.84 [0.78 to 0.90] for the test cohort. This indicates a high level of confidence in the model's discrimination performance.\n\nStatistical significance is also considered in the evaluation. Hazard ratios (HRs) for different risk subgroups are provided with confidence intervals and p-values, demonstrating the significance of the differences observed. For example, the highest difference in hazard rates between high-risk and low-risk subgroups was observed for death, with a test cohort HR of 14.0 [5.6 to 35.3] and a p-value of less than 0.001. This strong statistical significance suggests that the model effectively stratifies patients into different risk categories.\n\nAdditionally, the consistency of the models' performance between the training and test cohorts indicates good generalizability. The models were evaluated using cross-validation, repeated 100 times to account for variability, ensuring robust performance metrics. The use of penalized logistic regression with Lasso penalty further supports the reliability of the variable selection and model performance.",
  "evaluation/availability": "The raw evaluation files are not publicly available. The study does not mention the release of raw evaluation files or any specific details about their availability. The supporting material provided by the authors is posted with the online version of the article as a data supplement, but this does not include the raw evaluation files. The study focuses on the development and validation of risk prediction models using data from the Finnish Arthroplasty Register (FAR), and the results are presented in the form of tables and figures within the publication. The data supplement may contain additional tables and figures, but it does not provide access to the raw evaluation files."
