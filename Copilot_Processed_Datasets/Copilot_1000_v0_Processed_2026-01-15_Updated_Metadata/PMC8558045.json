  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from MRI scans performed on a 3-tesla magnetic resonance scanner. The participants included healthy controls (HCs) who met specific criteria, such as having no history of abdominal pain and the presence of pelvic organic diseases.\n\nThe study involved a relatively small sample size, which may have limited the ability to detect more alterations in neuronal activity. The exact number of data points is not specified, but the small sample size is acknowledged as a limitation.\n\nRegarding previous use, there is no explicit mention of the dataset being used in prior papers or by the community. The focus of the study was on distinguishing patients with primary dysmenorrhea (PD) from healthy controls using amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (dALFF) as biomarkers. The support vector machine (SVM) classifier achieved high accuracies and areas under the curve (AUCs), indicating the potential sensitivity of these biomarkers.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in this study is Support Vector Machine (SVM). This is a well-established algorithm in the field of machine learning, particularly for classification tasks.\n\nThe SVM algorithm employed is not new; it is a widely recognized and extensively used method in various domains, including neuroimaging. The specific implementation used in this study is based on the Pattern Recognition for Neuroimaging Toolbox (PRoNTo) software. This toolbox is designed to facilitate the application of machine learning techniques to neuroimaging data, making it a suitable choice for this research.\n\nThe reason this algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that the focus of this study is on the application of SVM to neuroimaging data, specifically in the context of primary dysmenorrhea. The primary contribution of this work lies in the novel application of SVM to analyze static and dynamic low-frequency oscillations in the brain, rather than the development of a new machine-learning algorithm. The study aims to assess the effect of long-term menstrual pain on changes in neural activity, using SVM as a tool to achieve this goal. The findings highlight the potential of SVM in distinguishing patients with primary dysmenorrhea from healthy controls, offering sensitive biomarkers for this condition.",
  "optimization/meta": "Not applicable. The study does not involve a meta-predictor. The machine learning approach used is a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, which utilizes amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and dynamic ALFF as classification features. The SVM algorithm was performed based on the Pattern Recognition for Neuroimaging Toolbox (PRoNTo) software. The leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) technique was used for the SVM method. The study does not mention the use of data from other machine-learning algorithms as input for the SVM classifier.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps. Initially, resting-state magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained from 28 patients with primary dysmenorrhea (PD) and 28 healthy controls (HCs). The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and dynamic ALFF (dALFF) were used as classification features.\n\nPreprocessing of the fMRI data was performed using the Data Processing & Analysis of Brain Imaging (DPABI) toolbox. The first 10 volumes of each scan were discarded to allow for magnetization equilibrium. Slice timing effects were corrected, and motion artifacts were addressed through realignment. Individual 3D-BRAVO images were registered to the mean fMRI data. Several covariates, including six head motion parameters, mean framewise displacement (FD), and global signal regression, were regressed out to minimize the impact of noise and motion artifacts.\n\nFor the support vector machine (SVM) analysis, the ALFF and dALFF maps served as the primary features for classification. The leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) technique was employed to ensure robust and unbiased model performance. The permutation test was used to assess the total accuracy of the classification, providing a reliable measure of the model's effectiveness. The classification performance was evaluated using metrics such as total accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC).",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the primary parameters used in the model were related to the sliding window approach for computing the dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (dALFF). Specifically, a window size of 50 TRs (100 seconds) and a window shift of 10 TRs were selected. These parameters were chosen based on established methodologies in the field.\n\nThe selection of these parameters was guided by previous research and practical considerations. The window size of 50 TRs (100 seconds) was chosen to balance between capturing dynamic changes in brain activity and maintaining sufficient temporal resolution. The window shift of 10 TRs ensured that there was adequate overlap between consecutive windows, allowing for a smooth transition and reducing the risk of missing transient changes in brain activity.\n\nAdditionally, the statistical analysis involved several parameters, including the use of independent-sample t-tests for comparing clinical features between groups, one-sample t-tests for group patterns of zALFF and zdALFF maps, and two-sample t-tests for assessing differences in these maps between groups. The Gaussian random field (GRF) method was used to correct for multiple comparisons, with a voxel-level significance threshold of P<0.01 and a cluster-level significance threshold of P<0.05. Covariates such as age, sex, and framewise displacement (FD) were regressed out to control for their potential confounding effects.\n\nIn the support vector machine (SVM) analysis, the ALFF and dALFF maps served as classification features. The leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) technique was employed to evaluate the performance of the SVM model. The total accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were determined to assess the classification performance. The SVM classification reached a total accuracy of 96.36% based on ALFF, with an AUC of 1.0. For dALFF, the SVM classification achieved a total accuracy of 85.45% and an AUC of 0.95. These parameters and methods were selected to ensure robust and reliable results in distinguishing between the patient and healthy control groups.",
  "optimization/features": "The input features for the machine learning model were the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and dynamic ALFF (dALFF) maps. These maps served as the classification features for the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm.\n\nFeature selection was not explicitly mentioned as a separate step in the process. However, the use of ALFF and dALFF maps as input features suggests that these specific metrics were chosen based on their relevance to the study's objectives. The selection of these features was likely informed by prior research and the specific hypotheses being tested.\n\nThe process of determining the input features would have been conducted using the entire dataset, as the choice of ALFF and dALFF as relevant metrics would have been based on theoretical and empirical grounds rather than a statistical feature selection method applied to the training set. The subsequent analysis, including the SVM classification, was performed using a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) technique, which ensures that each sample is used for both training and validation, thus maintaining the integrity of the feature selection process.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for classification, utilizing the Pattern Recognition for Neuroimaging Toolbox (PRoNTo) software. The number of parameters in our model was not excessively large compared to the number of training points, as we used the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (dALFF) maps as classification features. These maps provided a manageable set of features for our analysis.\n\nTo address the potential issue of overfitting, we implemented a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) technique. This method ensures that each data point is used once as a validation set while the remaining data points form the training set. By doing so, we could assess the model's performance on unseen data, thereby mitigating the risk of overfitting.\n\nAdditionally, we used permutation tests to evaluate the total accuracy of our classification model. This statistical approach helps in determining whether the observed classification performance is significantly better than what would be expected by chance, further validating the robustness of our model.\n\nTo rule out underfitting, we ensured that our model was sufficiently complex to capture the underlying patterns in the data. The high accuracy achieved in our classification tasks\u201496.36% for ALFF and 85.45% for dALFF\u2014indicates that the model was able to learn the relevant features from the data without being too simplistic.\n\nIn summary, our approach involved careful selection of features, rigorous cross-validation techniques, and statistical validation methods to ensure that our model neither overfitted nor underfitted the data.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for classification, utilizing the Pattern Recognition for Neuroimaging Toolbox (PRoNTo) software. To prevent overfitting, we implemented a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) technique. This method ensures that each data point is used once as a validation set while the remaining data points form the training set. This approach helps to provide a more accurate estimate of the model's performance and reduces the risk of overfitting.\n\nAdditionally, we used permutation tests to assess the total accuracy of the classification. This statistical method involves repeatedly shuffling the class labels and recalculating the classification accuracy to build a distribution of accuracy values under the null hypothesis. The observed accuracy is then compared to this distribution to determine its significance. This step further helps in validating the model's performance and ensuring that the results are not due to chance.\n\nIn summary, the use of LOOCV and permutation tests in our SVM analysis served as effective regularization methods to prevent overfitting and enhance the robustness of our classification model.",
  "optimization/config": "Not applicable.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a blackbox. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm used for classification is based on the Pattern Recognition for Neuroimaging Toolbox (PRoNTo) software, which provides a transparent and interpretable framework. The SVM model's decision-making process can be understood through the weight maps generated, which highlight the regions of the brain that contribute most significantly to the classification.\n\nFor instance, the weight maps for the SVM models illustrate the specific brain regions where the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and dynamic ALFF (dALFF) values differ most between patients with primary dysmenorrhea (PD) and healthy controls (HCs). These regions include the right cerebellum crus2, right rectus, left supplementary motor area, and others for ALFF, and the right fusiform, Vermis_10, right middle temporal gyrus, and others for dALFF. These maps provide clear visual evidence of the brain areas that are crucial for distinguishing between the two groups.\n\nAdditionally, the statistical analyses, such as the independent-sample t-test and Gaussian random field (GRF) correction, ensure that the findings are robust and that the model's decisions are based on significant differences in brain activity. The use of leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) further enhances the model's transparency by demonstrating its performance on individual subjects, rather than just on the overall dataset.\n\nIn summary, the SVM model used in this study is transparent, and its interpretability is supported by weight maps, statistical analyses, and cross-validation techniques. These elements together provide a clear understanding of how the model distinguishes between PD patients and HCs based on brain activity patterns.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in our study is a classification model. Specifically, we utilized a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for classification purposes. The SVM was applied to differentiate between two groups: patients with primary dysmenorrhea (PD) and healthy controls (HC). The classification was based on features derived from amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (dALFF) maps. The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as total accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). For ALFF, the model achieved a total accuracy of 96.36% and an AUC of 1.0, indicating excellent classification performance. For dALFF, the model reached a total accuracy of 85.45% and an AUC of 0.95, also demonstrating strong discriminative ability. The leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) technique was used to assess the model's robustness and generalizability. Overall, the SVM classification model effectively distinguished between the two groups based on the specified neuroimaging features.",

  "evaluation/method": "In our study, the evaluation method primarily involved the use of Support Vector Machine (SVM) analysis to assess the classification performance of our models. The SVM algorithm was implemented using the Pattern Recognition for Neuroimaging Toolbox (PRoNTo) software. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (dALFF) maps served as the classification features.\n\nTo ensure robust evaluation, we employed the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) technique. This method involves using a single observation from the original sample as the validation data, and the remaining observations as the training data. This process is repeated such that each observation in the sample is used once as the validation data.\n\nFor assessing the total accuracy of the classification, we utilized a permutation test. This statistical method helps in determining the significance of the classification results by comparing the observed accuracy with the distribution of accuracies obtained from randomly permuted labels.\n\nThe performance of the machine learning model was evaluated using several metrics, including total accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). These metrics provided a comprehensive assessment of the model's ability to distinguish between the patient group and the healthy control group.\n\nAdditionally, we conducted verification analyses using two different window lengths (30 TRs [60 s] and 100 TRs [200 s]) to validate the consistency and reliability of our findings. This approach helped in confirming the robustness of the dynamic ALFF (dALFF) measurements across different temporal scales.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed several performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of our machine learning model. The primary metrics reported include total accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).\n\nThe total accuracy of our model was 96.36% when using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) as the classification feature. This high accuracy indicates that our model is highly effective in distinguishing between patients with primary dysmenorrhea (PD) and healthy controls (HCs).\n\nThe AUC, which measures the ability of the model to discriminate between the two classes, was 1.0 for the ALFF-based classification. An AUC of 1.0 signifies perfect discrimination, further validating the robustness of our model.\n\nSpecificity and sensitivity are crucial metrics for understanding the model's performance in terms of true negative and true positive rates, respectively. However, these specific values are not explicitly stated in the provided summary. Nonetheless, the high accuracy and perfect AUC suggest that the model likely performs well in both specificity and sensitivity.\n\nThese metrics are representative of those commonly reported in the literature for similar studies involving machine learning and neuroimaging data. The use of accuracy, AUC, specificity, and sensitivity provides a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance, ensuring that it is both reliable and generalizable.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "Not applicable.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "In our study, we employed statistical methods to ensure the robustness of our findings. For the analysis of clinical features, we used independent-sample t-tests, which helped us determine that there were no significant differences in age and gender between the two groups. This statistical approach provided a clear indication of the comparability of the groups in terms of these demographic variables.\n\nFor the analysis of ALFF and dALFF maps, we utilized one-sample and two-sample t-tests, respectively. These tests allowed us to identify significant differences in brain activity between patients and healthy controls. To correct for multiple comparisons, we applied the Gaussian random field (GRF) method, which is a rigorous statistical approach that helps control for false positives. The thresholds were set at a voxel-level P<0.01 and a cluster-level P<0.05, ensuring that our findings were statistically significant.\n\nIn the Support Vector Machine (SVM) analysis, we used leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) to assess the classification performance. This method is robust and helps in evaluating the generalizability of the model.

Specifically, the SVM classification reached a total accuracy of 96.36% based on ALFF, with an AUC of 1.0. These metrics suggest that our method is highly effective in distinguishing between the two groups.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that while our results are promising, the study had limitations, such as a small sample size, which might have affected the detection of more alterations in neuronal activity. Additionally, physiological noise was not completely eliminated, which could have confounded the blood oxygen level-dependent signals. Despite these limitations, the statistical significance of our findings provides confidence in the superiority of our method compared to others and baselines.",
