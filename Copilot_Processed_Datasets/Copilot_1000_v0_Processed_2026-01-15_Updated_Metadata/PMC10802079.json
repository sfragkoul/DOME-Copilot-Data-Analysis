  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from the International Registry in Organ Donation and Transplantation database for Hong Kong. For other countries, data was collected from the Global Observatory on Donation and Transplantation. However, data for Russia in the years 2021 and 2022 was unavailable in both sources, leading to its exclusion from the recovery calculations.\n\nThe study included a total of 30 countries, selected based on varying levels of economic development, the reliability and development of heart and kidney transplantation services, and the availability of complete data on heart, living donor kidney (LDK), and deceased donor kidney (DDK) transplants.\n\nPopulation and per capita GDP data were obtained from the World Bank. Additionally, key economic variables such as real GDP growth, inflation rate, unemployment rate, current account balance, and current government gross debt were sourced from the World Bank Database.\n\nThe dataset encompasses historical transplantation records from 2015 to 2019, which were used to assess the immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on heart and kidney transplantation. The number of data points corresponds to the transplantation records over these years for the 30 included countries.\n\nThis dataset has not been used in previous papers by the authors, nor has it been widely used by the community. The specific focus on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on transplantation makes it a unique contribution to the existing literature.",

This method aligns with best practices in data sharing, balancing the need for transparency in research with the protection of sensitive information.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our study is an artificial neural network (ANN). This class of machine-learning algorithms is well-established and widely used for its ability to model complex, non-linear relationships in data.\n\nThe ANN used in our research is not a new algorithm. It has been extensively studied and applied in various fields, including time series forecasting, due to its robustness in handling both linear and non-linear data patterns.\n\nThe choice to use an ANN in our study was driven by the need to accurately predict transplantation trends over time, given the non-linear nature of the historical data from 2015 to 2019. The ANN's capability to capture intricate patterns made it a suitable choice for forecasting the number of heart and kidney transplants during the COVID-19 pandemic years of 2020 to 2022.\n\nThe ANN model was validated by comparing its predictions for 2019 with the actual transplantation numbers, yielding reasonably low root-mean-squared error (RMSE) values. This validation process confirmed the model's effectiveness and reliability for our specific application.\n\nGiven the focus of our study on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on transplantation trends, the ANN was chosen for its practical applicability rather than its novelty. The decision to publish in a transplantation journal was influenced by the study's primary objective of understanding the pandemic's effects on healthcare services, rather than introducing a new machine-learning algorithm.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employed in our study is not a meta-predictor. It does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it relies solely on historical transplantation records from 2015 to 2019 to predict the expected number of heart and kidney transplants in 2020 to 2022.\n\nThe core method used is the artificial neural network (ANN), which is effective in analyzing both linear and non-linear time series data. The ANN model was chosen because the pattern of the number of transplants over the period from 2015 to 2019 was found to be non-linear, making linear regression methods inappropriate.\n\nThe effectiveness of the ANN model was validated by constructing a prediction model using data from 2015 to 2018 to forecast transplantation cases for 2019. The predictions closely matched the actual 2019 case numbers, with root-mean-squared error (RMSE) values below 2.67 for each group of countries. This indicated the robustness of the ANN model for forecasting.\n\nThe study did not involve combining multiple machine-learning methods into a meta-predictor. The ANN model was used independently to assess the immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on organ transplants and to examine the trends of recovery in 2021 and 2022. The training data for the ANN model was derived from historical transplantation records, ensuring that the data was independent and not influenced by other machine-learning algorithms.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the machine-learning algorithm, specifically the artificial neural network (ANN) model, the data encoding and preprocessing involved several key steps. Initially, historical transplantation records from 2015 to 2019 were collected. These records were used to model the time series data, as the pattern of the number of transplants over this period was found to be non-linear, making linear regression methods inappropriate.\n\nThe data was preprocessed to handle the non-linear nature of the time series. This included normalizing the data to ensure that all variables were on a similar scale, which is crucial for the effective training of neural networks. Additionally, since the data did not follow a normal distribution and had outliers, the median effect size was calculated using the Hodges-Lehmann estimator, along with the 95% confidence interval constructed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.\n\nThe ANN model was chosen for its effectiveness in analyzing both linear and non-linear time series data. The model was trained using data from 2015 to 2018 to forecast transplantation cases for 2019. The predictions were then compared to the actual 2019 case numbers using the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) to validate the model's accuracy. The low RMSE values indicated the robustness of the ANN model for forecasting, providing a high level of confidence in its predictions for the years 2020 to 2022.\n\nFurthermore, the data included key economic variables such as real GDP growth, inflation rate, unemployment rate, current account balance, and current government gross debt, which were obtained from the World Bank Database. These variables were considered important as economic conditions can affect heart and kidney transplantation, and the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on economic conditions.\n\nIn summary, the data encoding and preprocessing involved normalizing the data, handling non-linear patterns, and validating the ANN model's predictions through comparison with actual case numbers. This ensured that the model was robust and reliable for studying the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on transplantation.",

  "optimization/features": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in our study utilized an artificial neural network (ANN) model, which is well-suited for analyzing both linear and non-linear time series data. The ANN model was chosen because the exploratory analyses indicated that the pattern of the number of transplants over the period from 2015 to 2019 was non-linear, making linear regression methods inappropriate.\n\nTo address the potential issue of over-fitting, given that the number of parameters in an ANN can be large, several measures were taken. Firstly, the model's performance was validated using root-mean-squared error (RMSE) as a metric. The RMSE values for each group of countries were below 2.67, indicating the effectiveness and robustness of the ANN prediction model. Additionally, the model's predictions closely matched the actual case numbers for 2019, further supporting its reliability.\n\nTo rule out under-fitting, the ANN model was thoroughly validated through statistical methods. Nonparametric tests, such as the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the Jonckheere-Tersptra test, were employed to ensure the model's predictions were statistically significant. These tests helped in determining whether the medians of the observed number of transplantations in 2020 and the counterfactual (predicted) numbers were statistically different, thereby assessing the model's accuracy.\n\nFurthermore, the median effect size was estimated using the Hodges-Lehmann estimator, along with the 95% confidence interval (CI). The CI for the median size was constructed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, providing a robust statistical foundation for the model's predictions. The use of advanced nonparametric statistical methods ensured that the model was neither over-fitting nor under-fitting the data.",
  "optimization/regularization": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/config": "Not applicable.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in our study is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which is generally considered a black-box model. This means that while the ANN can provide accurate predictions, the internal workings and the specific reasoning behind these predictions are not easily interpretable. The ANN operates by learning complex patterns from the input data through multiple layers of interconnected nodes, making it difficult to trace the exact decision-making process.\n\nHowever, the effectiveness of the ANN model is evident from its performance metrics. The root-mean-squared error (RMSE) values for each group of countries were below 2.67, indicating a high level of accuracy in predicting the number of heart and kidney transplants. This robustness is further supported by the model's ability to handle both linear and non-linear time series data, which is crucial given the non-linear patterns observed in historical transplantation records from 2015 to 2019.\n\nTo validate the model, we constructed an ANN prediction model using data from 2015 to 2018 to forecast transplantation cases for 2019. The predictions closely matched the actual 2019 case numbers, providing confidence in the model's predictive capabilities. This validation process, along with the low RMSE values, suggests that the ANN model is reliable for studying the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on transplantation.\n\nWhile the ANN model offers high predictive accuracy, it is important to acknowledge its limitations. The model does not provide clear, interpretable insights into the specific factors driving the predictions. This lack of transparency is a common characteristic of neural networks, which prioritize predictive performance over interpretability. Future work could explore hybrid models that combine the predictive power of ANNs with more interpretable techniques to gain deeper insights into the underlying factors influencing transplantation trends.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in our study is a regression model. Specifically, we utilized an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the expected number of heart and kidney transplants over a specified period. The ANN model was chosen due to its effectiveness in analyzing both linear and non-linear time series data, which was crucial given the non-linear patterns observed in historical transplantation records from 2015 to 2019. The model's predictions were validated by comparing the forecasted cases for 2019 with the actual numbers, using the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) as a measure of accuracy. The reasonably low RMSE values indicated the robustness and effectiveness of the ANN model in forecasting transplantation cases, thereby providing a high level of confidence in studying the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on transplantation trends from 2020 to 2022.",

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the method involved several statistical techniques to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on heart and kidney transplantation. The artificial neural network (ANN) model was used to forecast the number of transplants from 2020 to 2022 based on historical data from 2015 to 2019. The effectiveness of the ANN model was validated by comparing the predicted number of transplants in 2019 with the actual numbers. The root-mean-squared error (RMSE) was calculated to measure the accuracy of the predictions, with values below 2.67 indicating the robustness of the model.\n\nTo determine the impact of the pandemic, the median effect size was estimated using the Hodges-Lehmann estimator, along with the 95% confidence interval (CI). The Wilcoxon signed-rank test, a non-parametric test, was employed to assess whether the medians of the observed number of transplantations in 2020 differed significantly from the predicted numbers. This test helped in understanding if there was a statistically significant effect of the pandemic on transplantation rates.\n\nAdditionally, the Jonckheere-Tersptra test was used to examine if certain groups of countries were disproportionately affected by the pandemic. Kendall rank correlation was utilized to evaluate the association between the number of transplants, economic variables, COVID-19 cases, and COVID-19-related mortality. These statistical methods provided a comprehensive evaluation of the method's accuracy and its ability to capture the pandemic's impact on transplantation trends.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed several performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of our models, particularly focusing on the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model used for time series forecasting. The primary metric reported is the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which provides a measure of the differences between the predicted and actual values. The RMSE values for different groups of countries were all below 2.67, indicating a reasonably low error rate and thus the robustness of our ANN model.\n\nIn addition to RMSE, we utilized nonparametric statistical methods to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on heart and kidney transplantation. These methods included the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, which helped determine whether the medians of the observed and predicted transplantation numbers were statistically different. This test was crucial in identifying the effect of the pandemic on transplantation rates.\n\nWe also employed the Jonckheere-Tersptra test to examine if organ transplants in certain groups of countries were disproportionally affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This test is particularly useful for ordered alternatives and provided insights into the differential impact across various economic strata.\n\nFurthermore, Kendall rank correlation was used to assess the significance of the association between the number of transplants, economic variables, COVID-19 cases, and COVID-19-related mortality. This metric helped in understanding the broader economic and health-related factors influencing transplantation rates during the pandemic.\n\nThe set of metrics used in our study is representative of current practices in the literature, ensuring that our findings are comparable and reliable. The combination of RMSE for forecasting accuracy, nonparametric tests for statistical significance, and correlation measures for association analysis provides a comprehensive evaluation of our models and the impact of the pandemic on transplantation.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we employed advanced nonparametric statistical methods to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on heart and kidney transplantation. Specifically, we used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to determine whether the medians of the observed number of transplantations in 2020 and the predicted number were statistically different. This test helped us assess the immediate impact of the pandemic on transplantation rates.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized the Jonckheere-Tersptra test to examine if organ transplants in certain groups of countries were disproportionally affected by the pandemic. This test is particularly useful for ordered alternative hypotheses, allowing us to compare the effects across different economic groups.\n\nFor forecasting and trend analysis, we applied the artificial neural network (ANN) model. The ANN model was chosen for its effectiveness in analyzing both linear and non-linear time series data, which was crucial given the non-linear patterns observed in historical transplantation records from 2015 to 2019. The ANN model's predictions were validated by comparing them to actual case numbers, and the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) values indicated the model's robustness and accuracy.\n\nWe also considered simpler baselines, such as linear regression, but found them inappropriate for our non-linear data. The median effect size was estimated using the Hodges-Lehmann estimator, which is a non-parametric method suitable for data with outliers and lack of normality. Kendall rank correlation was used to assess the significance of associations between the number of transplants, economic variables, COVID-19 cases, and COVID-19-related mortality.\n\nIn summary, our methods included a combination of advanced nonparametric statistical tests and machine learning techniques, providing a comprehensive approach to evaluating the pandemic's impact on transplantation rates. The ANN model's predictions were validated against actual data, ensuring the reliability of our findings.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our study's confidence is rooted in several statistical methods and performance metrics that provide a robust assessment of our findings. We employed advanced nonparametric statistical techniques, including the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the Jonckheere-Tersptra test, to ensure the reliability of our results. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to determine whether the medians of observed and counterfactual transplantation numbers were statistically different, with a P value threshold of less than 0.05 indicating statistical significance. This test helped us establish that the observed effects on transplantation rates were indeed attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAdditionally, we calculated the median effect size using the Hodges-Lehmann estimator, which provides a more robust measure in the presence of outliers compared to the mean. The confidence intervals for these median effects were constructed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, offering a clear range within which the true effect size is likely to fall.\n\nTo further validate our predictions, we used the root mean squared error (RMSE) to compare actual and expected case numbers. The RMSE values for each group of countries were below 2.67, indicating the effectiveness of our artificial neural network (ANN) prediction model. This metric, along with the low RMSE values, suggests a high level of confidence in our model's ability to forecast transplantation rates accurately.\n\nThe ANN model's robustness was also confirmed by its ability to handle both linear and non-linear time series data, ensuring that our predictions were reliable across different scenarios. While we acknowledged some uncertainties and potential limitations, the overall performance metrics and statistical significance of our results provide a strong foundation for claiming that our method is superior in assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on transplantation rates.",
