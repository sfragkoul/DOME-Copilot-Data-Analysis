  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study consists of 632 HBV-infected patients with pathologic results of liver fibrosis who underwent non-contrast CT scans at our institution from January 2018 to December 2019. Various exclusion criteria were applied, such as lack of pathological records, absence of abdominal non-contrast CT images, poor image quality, co-infection with other viruses, presence of focal hepatic lesions, significant alcohol intake, and incomplete clinical data. After applying these criteria, 294 patients were included in the study.\n\nThe patients were divided into two cohorts based on the date of biopsy: a training cohort of 144 patients from January 2018 to December 2018, and a validation cohort of 150 patients from January 2019 to December 2019. The clinical data were obtained at the first diagnosis of chronic hepatitis B. The dataset includes various clinical characteristics and CT scan data, such as age, sex, blood routine tests, liver function examinations, lipid metabolism tests, C-reactive protein, and blood coagulation function. The dataset has not been used in previous papers or by the community.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset consists of two main splits: a training cohort and a validation cohort. The training cohort includes 144 patients, while the validation cohort comprises 150 patients. These splits were determined based on the date of biopsy, with the training cohort consisting of patients biopsied between January 2018 and December 2018, and the validation cohort including patients biopsied between January 2019 and December 2019. The clinical data for both cohorts were collected at the time of the first diagnosis of chronic hepatitis B. The baseline characteristics of the two cohorts were similar, ensuring a balanced distribution of clinical-radiological-pathological features.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The study involved 632 HBV-infected patients with pathologic results of liver fibrosis who underwent non-contrast CT scans. After applying exclusion criteria, 294 patients were included. The dataset was split into two cohorts based on the date of biopsy. The training cohort consisted of 144 patients who underwent biopsy between January 2018 and December 2018. The validation cohort consisted of 150 patients who underwent biopsy between January 2019 and December 2019. This temporal split ensured that the training and validation sets were independent.\n\nThe baseline characteristics of the training and validation cohorts were compared, and no significant differences were found in clinical-radiological-pathological characteristics between the two cohorts. This indicates that the distribution of the data in the training and validation sets is comparable, which is crucial for the generalizability of the model.\n\nThe study enforced independence between the training and validation sets by using a temporal split, which is a common practice in medical research to simulate real-world scenarios where the model is applied to future data. This approach helps to ensure that the model's performance is not overestimated due to data leakage or overfitting.\n\nThe distribution of the data in this study compares favorably to previously published machine learning datasets in the field of radiomics. The use of a temporal split and the absence of significant differences in baseline characteristics between the training and validation cohorts are strengths that enhance the reliability and validity of the findings.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data used in this study is not publicly available. This decision was made to protect the privacy of the patients involved. The study was conducted in a manner that ensures the confidentiality and security of the patient data, adhering to ethical guidelines and regulations. The institutional review board of the Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School approved this retrospective study, and the requirement for written informed consent was waived due to its retrospective nature.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm used in this study is the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression algorithm. This is a well-established machine-learning algorithm class, specifically a type of regularized regression that is used for feature selection and regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the statistical model it produces.\n\nThe LASSO algorithm is not new; it has been widely used in various fields, including biomedical research, for feature selection and model building. The reason it was not published in a machine-learning journal is that this study focuses on its application in the context of radiomics for predicting cirrhosis, rather than the development of the algorithm itself. The study leverages existing, proven methods to address a specific medical problem, which is predicting cirrhosis using radiomic features extracted from CT scans.\n\nThe LASSO algorithm was employed with penalty parameter tuning conducted by 10-fold cross-validation. This approach helps in selecting the optimal lambda (\u03bb) value, which controls the amount of regularization. The binomial deviance curves were plotted versus log(\u03bb), and the optimal \u03bb value was chosen based on the minimum criteria and the 1-standard error criteria. This process ensures that the selected features are both reproducible and relevant to the prediction of cirrhosis.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model developed in this study is not a meta-predictor. It does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it directly utilizes radiomic features extracted from non-contrast CT scans and clinical factors to predict cirrhosis.\n\nThe radiomics model for predicting cirrhosis was established using a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm based on selected radiomic features. These features were chosen through a two-step procedure involving intra- and interobserver reproducibility assessments and LASSO logistic regression.\n\nAdditionally, clinical factors were selected using Spearman correlation analysis and forward conditional logistic multivariable analysis. The final model integrates the radiomics signature with clinical predictors such as alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), globulin (GLOB), and international normalized ratio (INR).\n\nThe training and validation cohorts were independent, ensuring that the model's performance could be reliably assessed. The training cohort consisted of 144 patients, while the validation cohort included 150 consecutive patients. This independence is crucial for validating the model's generalizability and robustness.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing involved several steps to ensure the radiomic features were suitable for the machine-learning algorithm. Initially, 828 radiomic features were extracted from each region of interest (ROI), including first-order statistics, textural features, and wavelet-based transformations. These features were standardized using z-scores in the training cohort, and the same z-score transformation was applied to the validation cohort using the mean and standard deviation determined from the training cohort.\n\nTo ensure the reproducibility of the features, intra- and interobserver intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated based on 50 randomly chosen patients. Reader 1 repeated ROI segmentation twice within a week, while reader 2 independently performed ROI segmentation to assess intra- and interobserver reproducibility. Features with high reproducibility (ICC > 0.8 in both settings) were retained for subsequent analysis.\n\nA two-step procedure was employed to select significant radiomic features. First, features with high reproducibility were kept. Second, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression algorithm, with penalty parameter tuning conducted by 10-fold cross-validation, was used to select cirrhosis-related features with nonzero coefficients.\n\nThe selected features were then used to construct a radiomics signature using a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. This signature was integrated into a radiomics-based nomogram, which also included clinical predictors such as ALT, AST, GLOB, and INR. The nomogram provided a more understandable outcome measure and was validated in an independent cohort to assess its performance.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we employed a two-step procedure to select significant radiomic features. Initially, we retained features with high reproducibility, specifically those with an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) greater than 0.8 in both intra- and interobserver settings. This step ensured that only reliable features were considered for further analysis.\n\nFollowing this, we utilized the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression algorithm to identify cirrhosis-related features. The penalty parameter in the LASSO regression was tuned using 10-fold cross-validation, which helped in selecting features with nonzero coefficients. This process resulted in the selection of 25 cirrhosis-related features from the initial set of 828 extracted features.\n\nFor the clinical factors, we also followed a two-step procedure. First, we used Spearman correlation analysis to screen out factors with significant correlation (P < 0.05). Subsequently, forward conditional logistic multivariable analysis was employed to select factors for predicting cirrhosis. This analysis identified ALT, AST, GLOB, and INR as independent cirrhosis predictors.\n\nThe radiomics model for predicting cirrhosis (R-cirrhosis) was established as a binary classifier to distinguish between stages F0 \u2013 3 and F4. The model integrated the radiomics signature along with the clinical predictors ALT, AST, GLOB, and INR. The formula for the radiomics model was derived as Y = 0.734 \u00d7 ALT + 0.468 \u00d7 AST + 1.385 \u00d7 GLOB + 2.372 \u00d7 Radiomics signature \u2013 0.454.\n\nIn summary, the model used a combination of 25 radiomic features and four clinical parameters (ALT, AST, GLOB, and INR) to predict cirrhosis. The selection of these parameters was rigorous, involving reproducibility checks, LASSO regression, and multivariable analysis to ensure the reliability and significance of the features used in the model.",
  "optimization/features": "The study initially extracted 828 radiomic features from each region of interest (ROI). These features included first-order statistics, textural features, and wavelet-based transformations. To ensure the reliability of these features, a two-step procedure was employed for feature selection.\n\nFirst, features with high reproducibility were identified. This was done by calculating intra- and interobserver intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) based on 50 randomly chosen patients. Only features with an ICC greater than 0.8 in both intra- and interobserver settings were retained for subsequent analysis. This step resulted in 85 features being selected for further consideration.\n\nSecond, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression algorithm was used to select cirrhosis-related features. This algorithm, with penalty parameter tuning conducted by 10-fold cross-validation, identified 25 features with nonzero coefficients. These 25 features were deemed significant for predicting cirrhosis and were used as input for the radiomics model.\n\nThe feature selection process was performed using the training cohort only, ensuring that the validation cohort remained independent for model evaluation. This approach helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model's performance can be reliably assessed on unseen data.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The study involved extracting a large number of radiomic features (828 in total) from each region of interest (ROI) in non-contrast CT scans. This number is indeed much larger than the number of training points (144 patients in the training cohort). To address the risk of overfitting, several steps were taken.\n\nFirst, feature selection was performed in a two-step procedure. The initial step involved retaining features with high reproducibility, as quantified by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) greater than 0.8 in both intra- and interobserver settings. This ensured that only reliable features were considered for subsequent analysis.\n\nSecond, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression algorithm was employed. This method includes a penalty parameter that shrinks the coefficients of less important features to zero, effectively performing feature selection and regularization simultaneously. The penalty parameter was tuned using 10-fold cross-validation, which helps to prevent overfitting by ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data.\n\nAdditionally, the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was used to construct the radiomics signature. SVM is known for its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces and includes a regularization parameter that controls the trade-off between achieving a low training error and a low testing error, further mitigating the risk of overfitting.\n\nTo rule out underfitting, the model's performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in both the training and validation cohorts. The radiomics signature demonstrated favorable discriminatory ability with an AUC of 0.879 in the training cohort and 0.858 in the validation cohort, indicating that the model was not too simplistic to capture the underlying patterns in the data.\n\nFurthermore, the calibration of the nomogram was assessed using calibration curves and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, which showed good agreement between predicted and actual cirrhosis outcomes. This suggests that the model was well-calibrated and not underfitting the data.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression algorithm to prevent overfitting and to select significant radiomic features. This method is particularly useful for high-dimensional data, as it performs both variable selection and regularization to enhance the model's predictive accuracy and generalization to new data.\n\nThe LASSO regression was applied with penalty parameter tuning conducted by 10-fold cross-validation. This process helps in identifying the optimal lambda value, which controls the amount of shrinkage applied to the coefficients. By using cross-validation, we ensured that the model's performance was evaluated on multiple subsets of the data, reducing the risk of overfitting to any single subset.\n\nAdditionally, we selected features with high reproducibility, quantified using intra- and interobserver intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Only features with an ICC greater than 0.8 in both intra- and interobserver settings were retained for subsequent analysis. This step further ensured that the selected features were robust and reliable, minimizing the chances of overfitting to noise or artifacts in the data.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization schedule used in our study are detailed within the publication. Specifically, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression algorithm was employed with penalty parameter tuning conducted by 10-fold cross-validation. The support vector machine (SVM) was performed using the \"e1071\" package on R software (version 3.6.1). The optimal \u03bb value of 0.0383 was chosen for the LASSO model. The radiomics model for predicting cirrhosis was established as a binary classifier to distinguish between stages F0 \u2013 3 and F4.\n\nThe model files and optimization parameters are not explicitly provided in the publication. However, the methods and tools used for the analysis are well-documented, allowing for reproducibility. The R software and specific packages mentioned are openly available and can be accessed under their respective licenses. The details of the statistical analyses, including the use of the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and decision curve analysis (DCA), are also described, ensuring that the optimization process can be replicated by other researchers.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in this study is not entirely a black box, as it incorporates both radiomic features and clinical factors to predict cirrhosis. The radiomics signature, constructed using a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, is based on selected radiomic features that have shown high reproducibility and are related to cirrhosis. These features include first-order statistics, textural features, and wavelet-based transformations extracted from non-contrast CT scans.\n\nThe model's transparency is further enhanced by the integration of clinical predictors through a nomogram. The nomogram includes specific clinical factors such as alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), globulin (GLOB), and international normalized ratio (INR), each with defined cutoff values. For instance, ALT levels above 25.9 U/L, AST levels above 32.6 U/L, GLOB levels above 33.9 g/L, and INR values above 1.10 are considered significant predictors of cirrhosis.\n\nThe formula used in the radiomics model, Y = 0.734 \u00d7 ALT + 0.468 \u00d7 AST + 1.385 \u00d7 GLOB + 2.372 \u00d7 Radiomics signature \u2013 0.454, provides a clear mathematical representation of how these factors contribute to the prediction of cirrhosis. This formula allows for a quantitative assessment of the impact of each variable on the model's output.\n\nAdditionally, the use of decision curve analysis (DCA) and calibration curves helps to evaluate the model's performance and clinical utility. The calibration curves demonstrate the agreement between predicted and actual cirrhosis outcomes, while the DCA shows the net benefit of using the model at different threshold probabilities. These visual and statistical tools enhance the interpretability of the model by providing insights into its accuracy and reliability.\n\nOverall, while the radiomics component involves complex feature extraction and selection processes, the integration of clinical factors and the use of a nomogram make the model more interpretable and transparent. This approach allows clinicians to understand the contribution of both imaging and clinical data to the prediction of cirrhosis, facilitating better decision-making and patient management.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a binary classifier, specifically designed to distinguish between stages F0 \u2013 3 and F4 of liver cirrhosis. It utilizes a radiomics signature constructed using a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, along with selected clinical factors, to predict the presence of cirrhosis. The output of the model is a probability score that indicates the likelihood of a patient having cirrhosis. This probability is then used to make a binary classification, determining whether the patient is likely to have cirrhosis (stage F4) or not (stages F0 \u2013 3). The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and the overall correctly classified rate. Additionally, a nomogram is constructed to provide a more understandable outcome measure, integrating the radiomics signature and clinical predictors. The model's formula combines the radiomics signature with clinical factors such as alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), globulin (GLOB), and international normalized ratio (INR) to generate a predictive score. The final output is a binary classification of cirrhosis status based on this score.",

The model's diagnostic performance was further assessed using the Delong test to compare AUC values and decision curve analysis (DCA) to calculate the net benefit at different threshold probabilities.\n\nThe calibration of the radiomics model was evaluated using calibration curves and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, which indicated a good fit between predicted and actual cirrhosis outcomes. The model's performance was internally validated using an independent validation cohort, ensuring that the results were consistent and reliable. Additionally, the overall correctly classified rate, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's effectiveness.",
  "evaluation/measure": "The performance of the established models was evaluated using several key metrics. The area under the curve (AUC) was used to assess the discriminatory ability of the models. The radiomics-based model demonstrated superior performance with an AUC of 0.915 in the training cohort and 0.872 in the validation cohort. This was significantly higher than the AUC values for CT-reported cirrhosis alone, APRI, and FIB-4, indicating better discriminatory power.\n\nThe overall correctly classified rate of the nomogram was 82.0%, with a sensitivity of 77.5% and a specificity of 85.1%. The positive predictive value was 78.2%, and the negative predictive value was 84.6%.

The Hosmer-Lemeshow test yielded p-values of 0.317 in the training cohort and 0.534 in the validation cohort, suggesting no significant departure from a good fit. This indicates that the model's predictions are well-calibrated.\n\nDecision curve analysis (DCA) was employed to evaluate the net benefit of using the models at different threshold probabilities. This analysis helps in understanding the clinical utility of the models by comparing them across a range of threshold probabilities.\n\nThe reported metrics are comprehensive and representative of standard practices in evaluating predictive models in medical research. They provide a clear picture of the model's performance, including its accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and calibration, making it comparable to other studies in the literature.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we conducted a thorough comparison of our radiomics-based model with several established methods to evaluate its performance. We compared our model against CT-reported cirrhosis status, the aspartate transaminase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI), and the fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index. These comparisons were performed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) as the primary metric.\n\nThe radiomics nomogram demonstrated superior discriminatory ability compared to the other methods. In the training cohort, the AUROC for the radiomics nomogram was 0.915, significantly higher than the AUROC values for CT-reported cirrhosis status (0.752), APRI (0.725), and FIB-4 (0.664). Similarly, in the validation cohort, the radiomics nomogram achieved an AUROC of 0.872, which was also significantly higher than the AUROC values for CT-reported cirrhosis status (0.755), APRI (0.731), and FIB-4 (0.688).\n\nThese comparisons were statistically validated using the Delong test, which confirmed the significant differences in AUROC values between the radiomics nomogram and the other methods. The radiomics nomogram not only outperformed the simpler baselines but also showed consistent performance across both the training and validation cohorts, indicating its robustness and reliability.\n\nAdditionally, we evaluated the overall correctly classified rate, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the radiomics nomogram. The nomogram achieved an overall correctly classified rate of 82.0%, with a sensitivity of 77.5%, a specificity of 85.1%, a positive predictive value of 78.2%, and a negative predictive value of 84.6%. These metrics further highlight the superior performance of the radiomics nomogram compared to the other methods.\n\nIn summary, our radiomics-based model was rigorously compared to publicly available methods and simpler baselines, demonstrating its superior performance in predicting cirrhosis. The consistent and significant improvements in AUROC values, along with favorable diagnostic metrics, underscore the potential of our radiomics nomogram as a valuable tool for clinical decision-making.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the radiomics-based model for predicting cirrhosis includes several performance metrics with associated confidence intervals, ensuring a robust assessment of the model's effectiveness. The area under the curve (AUC) values, which measure the model's discriminatory ability, are provided with 95% confidence intervals. For instance, in the training cohort, the radiomics-based model achieved an AUC of 0.915 (95% CI: 0.869, 0.961), significantly higher than other methods like CT-reported cirrhosis alone (AUC: 0.752; 95% CI: 0.683, 0.821), APRI (AUC: 0.752; 95% CI: 0.683, 0.821), and FIB-4 (AUC: 0.664; 95% CI: 0.575, 0.753). Similarly, in the validation cohort, the radiomics nomogram yielded an AUC of 0.872 (95% CI: 0.814, 0.930), outperforming CT-reported cirrhosis alone (AUC: 0.755; 95% CI: 0.683, 0.827), APRI (AUC: 0.731; 95% CI: 0.649, 0.814), and FIB-4 (AUC: 0.688; 95% CI: 0.601, 0.775).\n\nStatistical significance is assessed using the Delong test to compare AUC values, confirming that the radiomics-based model's performance is superior to other methods. The nomogram's calibration is evaluated using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, which yielded p-values of 0.317 in the training cohort and 0.534 in the validation cohort, indicating no departure from a good fit.
