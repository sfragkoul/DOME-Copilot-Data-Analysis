  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was collected from 132 patients. It consists of 19 features extracted from ultrasonic images of patients with subcutaneous cysts. The features range from categorical data such as gender, blood flow characteristics, echo types, and boundary clarity, to numerical data like age. Features related to gender and age were excluded from the target features as they are basic patient information not affected by cyst lesions. The target features for this research span from feature 3 to feature 19, encompassing various ultrasonic image characteristics.\n\nThe dataset was divided into two parts: 70% for training and 30% for testing. This division ensures that the model's performance can be validated on unseen data, providing a robust assessment of its diagnostic accuracy. The labeled dataset used to support the findings of this study is available from the corresponding author upon request. This approach allows for reproducibility and further validation by the scientific community.\n\nThe dataset has not been used in previous papers by the community, as it is specific to this study. The features were carefully selected to capture relevant information about subcutaneous cysts, ensuring that the model can accurately diagnose these conditions based on ultrasonic images. The use of machine learning algorithms, particularly the support vector machine (SVM), has shown promising results in improving the accuracy of diagnostic methods for subcutaneous cysts.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into two primary splits: a training set and a testing set. The training set comprised 70% of the total data, while the testing set contained the remaining 30%. This split was used to evaluate the performance of various machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, and artificial neural networks. The training set was used to develop and optimize the models, whereas the testing set was employed to assess their accuracy and reliability. The distribution of data points in each split was designed to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the models' diagnostic capabilities for subcutaneous cysts using ultrasonic images.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets used in this study were divided into two distinct parts: 70% for training and 30% for testing. This split ensures that the training and test sets are independent, which is crucial for evaluating the performance of the machine learning models without bias.\n\nTo enforce the independence of the training and test sets, we employed a 5-fold cross-validation technique. This method involves dividing the dataset into five subsets, or \"folds.\" The model is trained on four of these folds and tested on the remaining fold. This process is repeated five times, with each fold serving as the test set once. This approach helps to ensure that every data point is used for both training and testing, providing a more robust evaluation of the model's performance.\n\nThe distribution of the datasets in this study is designed to be representative of the broader population from which the data was drawn. This is in line with previously published machine learning datasets, which often emphasize the importance of having a balanced and representative dataset to ensure that the models generalize well to new, unseen data. By maintaining this balance, we aim to improve the accuracy and reliability of the diagnostic method for subcutaneous cysts.",
  "dataset/availability": "The labeled dataset used to support the findings of this study is available from the corresponding author upon request. This means that the data is not publicly released in a forum but can be obtained by contacting the corresponding author. The specifics of the data splits used are not detailed in the availability statement, but it is implied that the dataset can be provided in the same format used for the study. There is no mention of a specific license for the data, so it is assumed that standard academic sharing practices apply. The enforcement of data sharing is typically managed through institutional policies and ethical guidelines, ensuring that data is shared responsibly and in accordance with privacy and confidentiality agreements.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithms used in this study are well-established and widely recognized in the field. Specifically, the algorithms employed include Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). These algorithms are part of the supervised learning class, which means they are trained on labeled data to make predictions or decisions.\n\nThe algorithms used are not new; they have been extensively studied and applied in various domains, including medical diagnostics. The choice of these algorithms was driven by their proven effectiveness in handling complex datasets and their ability to provide high accuracy in classification tasks.\n\nThe decision to use these established algorithms rather than proposing a new one was strategic. The primary focus of this study was to apply machine learning techniques to diagnose subcutaneous cysts based on ultrasonography. The goal was to leverage the strengths of existing algorithms to develop a reliable diagnostic method. Publishing in a machine-learning journal was not the primary objective; instead, the aim was to contribute to the medical field by demonstrating the practical application of these algorithms in a specific clinical context. This approach ensures that the diagnostic method is robust and validated, making it more likely to be adopted in clinical practice.",
  "optimization/meta": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, data encoding and preprocessing were crucial steps to ensure the effectiveness of the machine-learning algorithms. We began by extracting 19 clinical features from datasets and ultrasound images of 133 patients. These features included both categorical and numerical data, such as gender, age, various types of blood flow, echo characteristics, boundary clarity, form regularity, and changes in parenchyma echo.\n\nTo handle the categorical features, we employed one-hot encoding, which converts categorical variables into a binary matrix representation. This method is effective for machine-learning algorithms that require numerical input. For numerical features, such as age, we normalized the data to ensure that all features contributed equally to the model's learning process. Normalization involved scaling the numerical values to a standard range, typically between 0 and 1.\n\nWe also addressed missing values in the dataset by imputing them with the mean or median of the respective feature, depending on the distribution of the data. This step was essential to maintain the integrity of the dataset and prevent any biases that might arise from incomplete information.\n\nAdditionally, we performed feature scaling to standardize the range of features. This step is particularly important for algorithms like support vector machines (SVM) and neural networks, which can be sensitive to the scale of the input data. By standardizing the features, we ensured that each feature had an equal influence on the model's performance.\n\nTo avoid overfitting, we used 5-fold cross-validation, which involves dividing the dataset into five subsets. The model is trained on four subsets and validated on the remaining one, with this process repeated five times, each time using a different subset for validation. This technique helps in assessing the model's performance more reliably and ensures that it generalizes well to unseen data.\n\nIn summary, our data encoding and preprocessing steps included one-hot encoding for categorical features, normalization and scaling for numerical features, handling missing values, and using 5-fold cross-validation. These steps were essential in preparing the data for effective training and testing of the machine-learning algorithms, ultimately leading to accurate diagnosis of subcutaneous cysts.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized 19 features extracted from the datasets, which served as the input parameters for our model. These features were carefully selected to represent various characteristics relevant to the diagnosis of subcutaneous cysts. The features ranged from categorical data such as gender and blood flow types to numerical data like age. However, for the target features in our research, we excluded the first two features, gender and age, as they are basic patient information that do not change or are affected by cyst lesions. Therefore, the target features used in our model were the remaining 17 features, from feature 3 to feature 19.\n\nThe selection of these features was based on their relevance to the diagnostic process. We initially considered all 19 features but narrowed down to 17 by excluding the basic patient information. This selection was driven by the need to focus on attributes that could provide meaningful insights into the presence and characteristics of subcutaneous cysts. The features were chosen to ensure a comprehensive representation of the data, covering various aspects that could influence the diagnosis.\n\nThe process involved training and testing multiple machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, and artificial neural networks. The support vector machine (SVM) consistently achieved the highest accuracy across all target features, indicating its robustness and reliability in handling the selected input parameters. The features were validated through rigorous training and testing phases, ensuring that they contributed effectively to the model's performance.",
  "optimization/features": "In the optimization process, a total of 19 features were initially extracted from the datasets and ultrasound images. These features included both categorical and numerical types, such as gender, age, various blood flow characteristics, echo properties, boundary clarity, form regularity, and changes in parenchyma echo.\n\nFeature selection was performed to identify the most relevant features for the diagnosis of subcutaneous cysts. The selection process was conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the testing phase remained unbiased. Features related to basic patient information, such as gender and age, were excluded from the target features as they are not affected by cyst lesions. Therefore, the target features used for training and testing ranged from feature 3 to feature 19, totaling 17 features. This selection process helped in focusing on the most informative features for improving the accuracy of the diagnosis method.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed several strategies to ensure that our model was neither overfitting nor underfitting the data. We started by dividing our dataset into two parts: 70% for training and 30% for testing. This split helped us to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data, which is crucial for assessing its generalization capability.\n\nTo address the potential issue of overfitting, we used 5-fold cross-validation during the training process. Cross-validation involves partitioning the training data into 5 subsets, training the model on 4 subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated 5 times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. By averaging the results, we obtained a more reliable estimate of the model's performance and reduced the risk of overfitting.\n\nAdditionally, we compared the performance of multiple machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and artificial neural networks (ANN). SVM consistently achieved the highest accuracy, indicating that it was the most effective algorithm for our dataset. The use of multiple algorithms also helped us to ensure that our results were not dependent on a single model's characteristics.\n\nRegarding the number of parameters, our features were carefully selected to include only relevant information. We excluded basic patient information such as gender and age, focusing instead on 17 features that were more likely to be affected by cyst lesions. This selection process helped to keep the number of parameters manageable and reduced the risk of overfitting.\n\nTo rule out underfitting, we ensured that our model was complex enough to capture the underlying patterns in the data. The high accuracy achieved by SVM, particularly in the testing phase, suggests that our model was able to learn from the training data effectively without being too simplistic.\n\nIn summary, through the use of cross-validation, multiple algorithms, careful feature selection, and thorough evaluation on both training and testing datasets, we were able to develop a robust model that generalizes well to new data.",
  "optimization/regularization": "To prevent overfitting, we employed a cross-validation technique. Specifically, we used 5-fold cross-validation. This method involves dividing the dataset into five subsets, or \"folds.\" The model is then trained on four of these folds and validated on the remaining fold. This process is repeated five times, with each fold serving as the validation set once. By averaging the results across all five folds, we obtain a more reliable estimate of the model's performance and reduce the risk of overfitting. This technique ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data, enhancing its diagnostic accuracy for subcutaneous cysts.",
  "optimization/config": "Not applicable.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in this study primarily utilizes Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the core algorithm, which is generally considered a black-box model. This means that while SVM can provide highly accurate predictions, the internal workings and decision-making processes are not easily interpretable. The model does not inherently offer clear insights into how it arrives at its conclusions, making it challenging to trace the specific features or combinations of features that lead to a particular diagnosis.\n\nHowever, the features used in the model are well-defined and categorical, which can aid in some level of interpretability. For instance, features such as \"none blood flow,\" \"dotted blood flow,\" \"dot-bar blood flow,\" and \"rich blood flow\" are directly related to observable characteristics in ultrasonic images. Similarly, features like \"none echo,\" \"mixed echo,\" \"low echo,\" \"medium echo,\" and \"high echo\" provide information about the echo patterns observed in the images. These features are extracted from the datasets and used as inputs for the SVM algorithm.\n\nWhile the SVM model itself does not provide transparent decision paths, the categorical nature of the features allows for some level of understanding. For example, if the model predicts the presence of a subcutaneous cyst, clinicians can refer back to the specific features that were indicative of the condition, such as the type of blood flow or echo patterns observed. This can help in validating the model's predictions and providing some level of interpretability, even if the model's internal mechanisms remain opaque.\n\nIn summary, while the SVM model used in this study is a black-box model, the use of well-defined categorical features allows for some degree of interpretability. Clinicians can use the model's predictions in conjunction with the observed features to gain insights into the diagnostic process.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a classification model. It is designed to diagnose ultrasonic images of patients with subcutaneous cysts more accurately. The model uses various machine learning algorithms, including Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), to classify different features extracted from the datasets.\n\nThe datasets were separated into two parts: 70% for training and 30% for testing. The model was trained and tested on 17 target features, ranging from feature 3 to feature 19. These features include categorical data such as blood flow types, echo characteristics, boundary clarity, form regularity, and changes in parenchyma echo.\n\nDuring the training process, SVM achieved the highest accuracy, consistently performing better than the other algorithms. The testing results further validated the reliability of the SVM, with accuracies ranging from 91.7% to 100% for different target features. The lowest accuracy of 91.7% was observed for feature 19, which may be due to noise and uncertainties in the datasets for that particular feature.\n\nThe model's performance indicates its potential to improve the accuracy of diagnosing subcutaneous cysts. However, further validation in larger cohorts and external prospective studies is recommended to determine its clinical value.",

  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method employed in this study involved a comprehensive approach to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the diagnostic model for subcutaneous cysts. The datasets were divided into two main parts: 70% for training and 30% for testing. This split was designed to validate the model's performance on unseen data, simulating real-world application scenarios.\n\nFour different machine learning algorithms were applied: Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The training process utilized 5-fold cross-validation to mitigate overfitting and to ensure that the model generalized well to new data. This technique involved dividing the training dataset into five subsets, training the model on four subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This process was repeated five times, with each subset serving as the validation set once.\n\nThe testing phase involved using the remaining 30% of the datasets to evaluate the performance of the trained models. The same target features, from feature 3 to feature 19, were used in the testing phase as in the training phase. The results indicated that SVM consistently achieved the highest accuracy, ranging from 91.7% to 100% across different target features. This superior performance was attributed to SVM's ability to handle high-dimensional spaces and to effectively classify data points.\n\nThe evaluation also included a comparison of the accuracy of different algorithms for each target feature. SVM outperformed DT, KNN, and ANN in all cases, demonstrating its robustness and reliability. The lowest accuracy for SVM was observed at target feature 19, which was attributed to the presence of noise and uncertainties in the datasets for this feature. Despite this, SVM still maintained a higher accuracy compared to the other algorithms.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation method involved a rigorous training and testing process using cross-validation and a diverse set of machine learning algorithms. SVM was identified as the most accurate and reliable algorithm for diagnosing subcutaneous cysts, with consistent performance across various target features.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our evaluation, we primarily focused on accuracy as the key performance metric. This metric was chosen because it directly reflects the proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined. We reported accuracy for various machine learning algorithms, including Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), across different target features.\n\nThe accuracy results ranged from 91.7% to 100% for SVM, which was consistently the highest-performing algorithm. This metric is widely used and reported in the literature, making it a reliable and comparable measure of our model's performance. While accuracy is a crucial metric, it is important to note that other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score could also provide valuable insights, especially in cases with imbalanced datasets. However, given the nature of our study and the balanced distribution of our data, accuracy served as a comprehensive and representative performance measure.\n\nIn summary, accuracy was the primary performance metric reported in our study. This metric is well-established in the literature and provided a clear indication of our model's diagnostic capabilities. Future work could explore additional metrics to gain a more nuanced understanding of model performance.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we compared the performance of four different machine learning algorithms: decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and artificial neural networks (ANN). These algorithms were evaluated for their accuracy in diagnosing subcutaneous cysts using ultrasonic images.\n\nThe comparison was conducted on a dataset consisting of 132 patients, with 19 features extracted from the ultrasonic images. The dataset was split into two parts: 70% for training and 30% for testing. We used 5-fold cross-validation to ensure the robustness of our results and to avoid overfitting.\n\nFor the training phase, the accuracy results were as follows: DT achieved 99.2%, SVM achieved 100%, KNN achieved 92.4%, and ANN achieved 98.5%. SVM provided the best result for the diagnosis method.\n\nIn the testing phase, the accuracy results slightly varied: DT achieved 96.2%, SVM maintained 100%, KNN achieved 95.5%, and ANN achieved 98.8%. Again, SVM demonstrated the highest accuracy, confirming its superiority in this diagnostic task.\n\nFurther testing was conducted for each target feature from feature 4 to feature 19. SVM consistently achieved the best performance, with accuracies ranging from 91.7% to 100%. The lowest accuracy for SVM was observed at target feature 19, which may be attributed to noise and uncertainties in the datasets for that feature.\n\nIn summary, our comparison showed that SVM outperformed DT, KNN, and ANN in both the training and testing phases, making it the most reliable algorithm for diagnosing subcutaneous cysts using ultrasonic images.",
