  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from patients who underwent contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) examinations. The study involved two cohorts: a training cohort consisting of 83 patients and a test cohort consisting of 36 patients. These patients were categorized into two groups: those with non-neoplastic gallbladder polyps (Non-NGB) and those with neoplastic gallbladder polyps (NGB). The training cohort included 65 non-NGB patients and 18 NGB patients, while the test cohort included 29 non-NGB patients and 7 NGB patients.\n\nThe data collected included various clinical and ultrasonic characteristics, such as age, height, weight, sex, drinking habits, smoking habits, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, fatty liver, and specific ultrasonic features like target lesion location, base width, surface characteristics, echo patterns, gallbladder wall status, presence of calculi, and cholecystitis. These characteristics were analyzed to develop a predictive model for differentiating between neoplastic and non-neoplastic gallbladder polyps.\n\nThe study aimed to integrate radiomic signatures with clinical indicators to enhance diagnostic accuracy. The dataset was used to formulate a logistic regression (LR) model, which demonstrated high predictive prowess and value in preoperative diagnosis. The model's performance was validated internally, showing an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.95, indicating its robustness in diagnostic efficacy.\n\nThe dataset's limitations include its retrospective nature, relatively small sample size, and the need for validation through a more extensive and diverse cohort. Future research plans involve expanding the dataset to include a larger and more diverse group of patients, as well as incorporating multicenter data to bolster the findings' generalizability and robustness. This approach will help in fine-tuning the predictive model and improving its clinical applicability.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into two main cohorts: a training cohort and a test cohort. The training cohort consisted of 83 data points, while the test cohort had 36 data points. Within these cohorts, further subdivisions were made based on specific characteristics.\n\nIn the training cohort, there were 65 non-neoplastic gallbladder polyp (non-NGB) cases and 18 neoplastic gallbladder polyp (NGB) cases. The test cohort included 29 non-NGB cases and 7 NGB cases. These subdivisions allowed for a detailed analysis of the differences between non-NGB and NGB cases within each cohort.\n\nThe distribution of data points in each split was carefully considered to ensure a representative sample for both training and testing purposes. This structure facilitated the development and validation of predictive models, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of their performance.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset was divided into two main cohorts: a training cohort and a test cohort. The training cohort consisted of 83 patients, while the test cohort included 36 patients. Both cohorts were further subdivided into non-neoplastic gallbladder polyp (Non-NGB) and neoplastic gallbladder polyp (NGB) groups.\n\nThe training cohort comprised 65 non-neoplastic cases and 18 neoplastic cases. The test cohort had 29 non-neoplastic cases and 7 neoplastic cases. This division ensured that the training and test sets were independent, allowing for an unbiased evaluation of the models' performance.\n\nTo enforce independence, the datasets were split based on distinct patient groups, ensuring that there was no overlap between the training and test cohorts. This approach is crucial for validating the generalizability of the models.\n\nThe distribution of demographic and clinical characteristics, such as age, height, and weight, did not show significant differences between the training and test cohorts. This consistency suggests that the datasets are comparable and representative of the broader population studied. The focus on specific indicators that exhibited notable differences, such as HDL levels and basal widths, further supports the robustness of the dataset division.\n\nThe datasets were analyzed using various statistical methods, including the Mann\u2013Whitney U test and logistic regression, to ensure that the selected features were statistically significant. This rigorous approach helps in maintaining the integrity and reliability of the dataset, making it comparable to previously published machine learning datasets in medical research.",
  "dataset/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our study primarily utilized logistic regression (LR) as the foundational model. This choice was driven by its effectiveness in handling binary classification problems and its interpretability, which is crucial in medical diagnostics. Logistic regression is a well-established machine-learning algorithm class, known for its simplicity and robustness in various predictive modeling tasks.\n\nThe decision to use logistic regression was not driven by the novelty of the algorithm itself but rather by its proven track record in medical research. While logistic regression is not a new algorithm, its application in our study is tailored to the specific context of diagnosing neoplastic gallbladder polyps (GBP). The algorithm was integrated with radiomic signatures derived from ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) data, enhancing its diagnostic accuracy.\n\nThe reason this algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that the focus of our research is on its application in medical diagnostics rather than the development of new machine-learning techniques. Our study aims to demonstrate the practical utility of logistic regression in improving the diagnostic performance of GBP, leveraging advanced imaging techniques and radiomic features. The integration of these elements into a cohesive diagnostic model is the primary contribution of our work, rather than the innovation of a new machine-learning algorithm.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employed in this study can be considered a meta-predictor, as it integrates multiple machine learning algorithms and clinical data to enhance predictive performance. Several machine learning methods were utilized, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). These algorithms were chosen for their diverse approaches to handling complex datasets and their established effectiveness in medical diagnostic predictions.\n\nThe meta-predictor combines clinical signatures with radiomic signatures derived from conventional ultrasound (US) and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). The radiomic signatures were developed using deep learning algorithms and various machine learning models, with the Logistic Regression (LR) model showcasing the highest performance. This integration aims to leverage the strengths of both clinical and radiomic data to improve the diagnostic accuracy of neoplastic gallbladder polyps (GBP).\n\nTo ensure the robustness of the model, a fivefold cross-validation strategy was employed. This method helps to validate that the training data is independent and that the model's performance is generalizable. The use of cross-validation ensures that the model is trained and tested on different subsets of the data, reducing the risk of overfitting and enhancing the reliability of the predictions.\n\nThe final model, a nomogram, amalgamates the radiomic signature with clinical indicators such as HDL, base width, and smoking data. This nomogram was constructed using logistic regression analysis and demonstrated optimal performance, as evidenced by high Area Under the Curve (AUC) values in both training and test cohorts. The nomogram's calibration curves and decision curve analysis further affirm its diagnostic efficacy and clinical utility.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, data encoding and preprocessing were crucial steps to ensure the effectiveness of our machine-learning algorithms. We began by extracting radiomic features from both conventional ultrasound (US) and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) images. Using 3D Slicer software and the PyRadiomics package, we harvested a comprehensive set of 1197 radiomic features from each region of interest (ROI). These features included various texture characteristics such as gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), gray-level run length matrix (GLRLM), gray-level size zone matrix (GLSZM), and neighborhood gray-tone difference matrix (NGTDM).\n\nTo refine these features, we employed the Mann\u2013Whitney U test to identify statistically significant features with a P-value below 0.05. Additionally, we used Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient to measure inter-feature correlations, retaining only those features with robust repeatability. Features with a correlation coefficient exceeding 0.9 were considered redundant, and only one of such correlated features was kept. This process ensured that our feature set was both representative and non-redundant.\n\nWe then applied a greedy recursive deletion strategy to further filter the features, successively removing the most redundant ones. This method helped in condensing the US radiomic signatures, CEUS radiomic signatures, and their combination into a manageable set of ten features.\n\nFor the formulation of the radiomics signature, we utilized the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model. LASSO, with its regulatory weight \u03bb, effectively shrunk the regression coefficients towards zero, thereby selecting the most relevant features. We identified the optimal \u03bb through tenfold cross-validation, minimizing the cross-validation error. The features retaining non-zero coefficients were then used to fit the regression model, resulting in a single radiomics signature.\n\nThis radiomics signature was computed for each patient by linearly combining the preserved features, weighted by their respective model coefficients. The final radiomics score for each individual was derived from this combination, providing a quantitative measure for further analysis.\n\nIn addition to radiomic features, clinical characteristics such as age, gender, pathological diagnosis, and specific laboratory tests (including liver function, total cholesterol, CA199, and carcinoembryonic antigen) were retrospectively collected and noted for each patient. These clinical features underwent similar statistical scrutiny to ensure their relevance and significance in the model.\n\nThe preprocessing steps ensured that both radiomic and clinical data were in a suitable format for input into various machine-learning models, including support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), multilayer perceptron (MLP), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and XGBoost. These models were then used to predict neoplastic gallbladder polyps (GBP), with the logistic regression model ultimately chosen for its superior performance.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized a comprehensive set of parameters to build robust predictive models. Initially, we extracted 1197 handcrafted features across nine distinct categories, including first-order features, shape features, and texture features. To select the most relevant features, we employed the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression model. This method helped us identify nonzero coefficients, which were then used to establish the Rad-score. The final selection of features was determined through a tenfold cross-validation process, ensuring that the model's performance was optimized. This approach allowed us to refine the number of parameters, focusing on those that contributed most significantly to the model's predictive accuracy. The specific features selected for the radiomics signature are detailed in Table 2, highlighting the importance of each parameter in distinguishing between neoplastic and non-neoplastic gallbladder polyps.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we initially extracted a comprehensive set of radiomic features. Specifically, we obtained 1197 handcrafted features across nine distinct categories, including first-order features, shape features, and various texture features. These features were derived from both conventional ultrasound (US) and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) data.\n\nTo ensure the robustness and relevance of these features, we performed a rigorous feature selection process. This involved using the Mann\u2013Whitney U test to screen features based on a P-value threshold of less than 0.05. Additionally, we employed Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient to measure inter-feature correlations, retaining only those features with a correlation coefficient below 0.9 to minimize redundancy.\n\nA greedy recursive deletion strategy was then applied to further filter the features, successively removing the most redundant ones. This method helped in maximizing the representational capability of the selected features. As a result, we condensed the features into three sets of radiomic signatures: US radiomic signatures, CEUS radiomic signatures, and a combined signature from both modalities, each preserving a total of ten features.\n\nThe feature selection process was conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the selected features were not influenced by the test data. This approach helps in maintaining the integrity and generalizability of our model.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed a robust methodology to address the potential issues of overfitting and underfitting, particularly given the high-dimensional nature of our radiomic features.\n\nWe began by extracting a large number of handcrafted features, totaling 1197, which indeed exceeded the number of training points. To mitigate the risk of overfitting, we utilized the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression. This technique assigns a zero value to the coefficients of numerous non-essential features, effectively performing feature selection and regularization simultaneously. By executing a tenfold cross-validation with minimum criteria, we identified an optimal \u03bb value that minimized cross-validation error. This process ensured that only the most relevant features retained non-zero coefficients, thereby reducing the model's complexity and preventing overfitting.\n\nSubsequent to LASSO feature selection, the remaining features were used to fit various machine learning models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and XGBoost. To further validate our models and rule out overfitting, we employed a fivefold cross-validation strategy. This approach helped in deriving a final Radiomics Signature that generalized well to unseen data.\n\nTo address underfitting, we ensured that our models were sufficiently complex to capture the underlying patterns in the data. For instance, we used deep learning algorithms and various machine learning models to scrutinize the performance of clinical signatures. The Logistic Regression (LR) model, in particular, showcased the pinnacle of performance, indicating that our models were adequately capturing the necessary information from the data.\n\nAdditionally, we constructed a nomogram that integrated the Radiomics Signature with clinical risk factors such as HDL, base width, and smoking data. This nomogram was validated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and the Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow test, ensuring that our model's predictions were both accurate and well-calibrated.\n\nIn summary, our approach involved careful feature selection using LASSO regression, rigorous cross-validation, and the integration of clinical and radiomic features to build a robust and generalizable model. These steps collectively helped us to rule out both overfitting and underfitting, ensuring the reliability and validity of our findings.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and enhance the generalization of our models. Specifically, we utilized the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression method. LASSO is particularly effective in feature selection and regularization by imposing a penalty on the absolute size of the regression coefficients. This process drives many coefficients to zero, effectively selecting a subset of the most relevant features while shrinking the less important ones. We determined the optimal regularization parameter, \u03bb, through a tenfold cross-validation process, aiming to minimize the cross-validation error. This approach ensured that our final model was robust and not overly complex, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting.\n\nAdditionally, we employed a fivefold cross-validation strategy during the model training phase. This technique involves dividing the dataset into five subsets, training the model on four subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated five times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. This method helps in assessing the model's performance more reliably and in ensuring that it generalizes well to unseen data.\n\nFurthermore, we integrated various machine learning models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and XGBoost, to formulate risk models. The use of multiple models and the comparison of their performances helped in selecting the most robust and generalizable model for our predictions.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters used in our study are detailed within the publication. Specifically, we employed various machine learning algorithms, including SVM, LR, MLP, KNN, and XGBoost, for the construction of risk models. The selection of features for these models was conducted using LASSO regression, with the final features being determined through a fivefold cross-validation strategy. The specific configurations and parameters for these models are outlined in the supplementary tables and figures provided within the paper.\n\nThe optimization schedule involved a tenfold cross-validation process to identify the optimal \u03bb value for LASSO regression, ensuring minimal cross-validation error. This process was crucial for feature selection and model fitting. The radiomics signature was then computed using a linear combination of the preserved features, each weighted by their respective model coefficients.\n\nModel files and detailed optimization parameters are not explicitly provided in the main text but are referenced in the supplementary materials. These materials include tables and figures that elaborate on the feature selection process, model performance metrics, and the construction of the nomogram. The supplementary tables, such as Table S1 and Table S2, provide comprehensive details on the univariate and multivariate analyses, as well as the performance of different machine learning models.\n\nRegarding the availability and licensing of these configurations and parameters, they are presented within the academic publication, which is typically accessible under the terms of the journal's publishing agreement. Researchers and practitioners can refer to the supplementary materials for a detailed understanding of the hyper-parameter configurations and optimization processes used in our study.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in this study is not a black-box but rather a transparent and interpretable one. This transparency is achieved through the use of logistic regression (LR) as the foundational algorithm for constructing the radiomics signature and the nomogram.\n\nThe LR model is inherently interpretable because it provides odds ratios for each variable, indicating the strength and direction of their association with the outcome. In our study, the LR model was used to integrate clinical variables with ultrasonic radiomic signatures, resulting in a nomogram that combines these features. The nomogram visually represents the contribution of each variable to the final prediction, making it easy to understand how different factors influence the likelihood of neoplastic gallbladder polyps.\n\nFor example, the nomogram includes variables such as HDL levels, base width, and smoking status, along with the radiomics signature. Each variable is assigned a specific point value, and the sum of these points corresponds to the probability of neoplastic gallbladder polyps. This visual representation allows clinicians to see the impact of each factor on the prediction, enhancing the model's interpretability.\n\nAdditionally, the use of LASSO regression for feature selection ensures that only the most relevant features are included in the model, further simplifying the interpretation. The final radiomics signature is a linear combination of selected features, weighted by their respective coefficients, which are derived from the LR model. This approach provides a clear and concise way to understand the model's predictions.\n\nIn summary, the model's transparency is achieved through the use of LR and the construction of a nomogram, which visually represents the contribution of each variable to the final prediction. This makes the model interpretable and useful for clinical decision-making.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a classification model. It is designed to predict whether gallbladder polyps (GBP) exceeding 10 mm in diameter are neoplastic or not. The primary output of the model is a binary classification indicating the likelihood of a GBP being neoplastic. This classification is achieved through a logistic regression (LR) algorithm, which is well-suited for binary outcome prediction. The model integrates clinical characteristics and radiomic features derived from contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) to enhance its predictive accuracy. The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as the Area Under the Curve (AUC) from Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration plots, and the Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow test, all of which are standard for assessing classification models. The final model, presented as a nomogram, combines the radiomic signature with clinical indicators to provide a comprehensive preoperative diagnostic tool for GBP.",

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method employed in this study was comprehensive and multifaceted, ensuring robust validation of the models developed. Initially, a tenfold cross-validation strategy was utilized to identify the optimal lambda (\u03bb) value for the LASSO regression model, aiming to minimize cross-validation error. This process helped in selecting features with non-zero coefficients, which were then used to fit the regression model and create a radiomics signature.\n\nSubsequently, a fivefold cross-validation strategy was applied to derive the final Radiomics Signature. This approach helped in assessing the model's performance and stability across different subsets of the data.\n\nTo enhance the predictive efficiency of the model, a nomogram was constructed. This nomogram integrated the radiomics signature with additional clinical factors such as HDL levels, base width, and smoking data. The diagnostic efficacy of this nomogram was evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, which provided insights into the model's sensitivity and specificity.\n\nCalibration curves were computed to assess the congruence between the nomogram's predictions and actual observations. The Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow test was employed to evaluate the calibration capabilities of the nomogram, ensuring that the predicted probabilities aligned well with the observed outcomes.\n\nFurthermore, a decision curve analysis (DCA) was conducted to assess the clinical utility of the predictive models. This analysis helped in determining the net benefit of using the models in clinical practice, providing a practical measure of their value.\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using IBM\u2019s SPSS Statistics 28 software and the R programming language, version 4.0.3. Quantitative parameters were expressed as means \u00b1 standard deviations (SDs), and comparative analyses were conducted using t-tests or Mann\u2013Whitney U tests. Categorical variables were analyzed using Fisher\u2019s exact test or the Chi-squared test. In the logistic regression model, only variables displaying statistical significance (P < 0.05) were incorporated into a multivariate model, ensuring that the final model was parsimonious and robust.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed a comprehensive set of performance metrics to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of our models. The primary metric reported is the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, which provides a single scalar value that represents the ability of the model to distinguish between neoplastic and non-neoplastic gallbladder polyps (GBP). We reported AUC values for various models, including those based on clinical signatures, radiomic signatures, and combined nomograms, across both training and test cohorts.\n\nIn addition to AUC, we also reported several other key performance metrics. These include accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), precision, recall, and the F1 score. These metrics offer a more granular view of model performance, highlighting strengths and weaknesses in different aspects of diagnostic accuracy.\n\nThe AUC values for the radiomic signature models, which combine conventional ultrasound (US) and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) features, were particularly notable. For instance, the combined US and CEUS radiomic signature achieved an AUC of 0.922 in the training cohort and 0.808 in the test cohort, indicating strong discriminative power. The nomogram, which integrates clinical and radiomic signatures, demonstrated an AUC of 0.947 in the training cohort and 0.867 in the test cohort, further underscoring its diagnostic potential.\n\nWe also conducted comparative analyses using the Delong test and the Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow test to assess the statistical significance and calibration of our models. The Delong test was used to compare the AUCs of different models, while the Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow test evaluated the goodness of fit for the clinical signature, radiomic signature, and nomogram.\n\nOur set of performance metrics is representative of standard practices in the literature, ensuring that our results are comparable with other studies in the field. The inclusion of multiple metrics allows for a thorough evaluation of model performance, providing a robust assessment of diagnostic accuracy and reliability. This comprehensive approach ensures that our findings are both valid and generalizable, contributing to the broader understanding of GBP diagnosis.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we conducted a comprehensive comparison of various methods to evaluate the performance of our models. We employed several machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and XGBoost. These algorithms were chosen for their diverse approaches to handling complex datasets and their established effectiveness in medical diagnostic predictions.\n\nTo assess the performance of our radiomics model, we compared it with these machine learning models. The comparison involved using clinical information, conventional ultrasound information, and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) information. Supplementary Table 2 details the predictions made using clinical information, while Supplementary Table 3 focuses on predictions derived from conventional ultrasound information. Supplementary Table 4 presents the predictions based on CEUS information. By integrating both conventional ultrasound and CEUS data, Supplementary Table 5 demonstrates the enhanced predictive capability of the combined radiomics model, achieving an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.922.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized the Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow test to inspect the fit of the clinical signature, radiomics signature, and nomogram. The results showed that the radiomics signature maintained a satisfactory fit in both the training and test cohorts, while the clinical signature demonstrated a tendency towards overfitting in the test cohort.\n\nFurthermore, we constructed a nomogram using the LR algorithm, which amalgamated clinical and radiomics signatures. This nomogram exhibited optimal performance, as visualized in Figure 4. A comparative analysis between the clinical signature, radiomics signature, and nomogram was conducted and presented in Table 3, with the Delong test utilized for statistical assessment in Table 4. The nomogram calibration curves affirmed a commendable congruence between the predicted and observed neoplastic gallbladder polyps (GBP) within both training and test cohorts.\n\nIn summary, our study involved a thorough comparison with simpler baselines and publicly available methods, ensuring a robust evaluation of our models' performance. The integration of clinical and radiomics signatures in the nomogram demonstrated superior diagnostic efficacy, substantiating the value of our approach in the preoperative diagnosis of neoplastic GBP.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our models included a comprehensive assessment of performance metrics, which were accompanied by confidence intervals to provide a clear understanding of their reliability. For instance, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) values for different models were reported with 95% confidence intervals, offering insights into the precision of these estimates. The AUC for the combined use of conventional ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) radiomic signatures was 0.922 (95% CI: 0.86\u20130.98), indicating a high level of confidence in the model's performance.\n\nStatistical significance was a key consideration in our analysis. The Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow test was employed to evaluate the fit of the clinical signature, radiomic signature, and nomogram. The P values obtained from this test for the training and test cohorts were reported, demonstrating the statistical validity of our models. For example, the radiomic signature showed P values of 0.933 and 0.233 for the training and validation cohorts, respectively, suggesting a good fit.\n\nAdditionally, the Delong test was utilized for statistical assessment, further confirming the superiority of our models. The nomogram, which integrated clinical and radiomic signatures, exhibited an AUC of 0.947 (95% CI: 0.903\u20130.991), underscoring its enhanced diagnostic performance. These results collectively substantiate that our radiomics models, particularly when combined with clinical indicators, outperform traditional ultrasound characteristics and provide a robust framework for diagnosing neoplastic gallbladder polyps.",
