  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this work consists of chest X-ray images categorized into COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia. These images were collected from several publicly available repositories, including Chest Imaging 2020, SIRM COVID-19 database 2020, and others. The dataset comprises a total of 2700 images, with 900 images for each category. The resolution of all images is standardized to 224 \u00d7 224 \u00d7 3 pixels.\n\nThe dataset includes contributions from various sources. For instance, the Chest Imaging 2020 repository provided 134 COVID-19 images, while the SIRM COVID-19 database 2020 contributed 64 images. The Covid-chest X-ray dataset by Chen et al. (2020) added 646 COVID-19 images. Additionally, the Kaggle repository supplied 900 normal and 900 pneumonia images. Other sources like Wang et al. (2020) and Kong et al. (2020) also contributed to the dataset.\n\nThis dataset has been utilized in previous studies and by the community for developing and validating diagnostic models for COVID-19. The images were randomly partitioned into training and testing sets, with 70% of the data used for training and the remaining 30% for testing. Data augmentation techniques were applied to resize all images to the specified resolution and convert grayscale images to color. This comprehensive dataset has enabled the development of robust models for accurate COVID-19 diagnosis.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset used in this study consists of chest X-ray images categorized into three classes: COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia. The images were collected from various publicly available repositories. The total number of images is 2700, with 900 images for each class.\n\nThe dataset was split into two main parts: training and testing. For training, 70% of the total images, amounting to 1890 images, were used. The remaining 30%, which is 810 images, were reserved for testing. The dataset was partitioned randomly for training and testing purposes.\n\nData augmentation techniques were applied to resize all images to a uniform size of 224 \u00d7 224 \u00d7 3 pixels and to convert grayscale images into color images.

  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset used in this study consists of chest X-ray images categorized into COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia. These images were collected from various publicly available repositories, totaling 2700 images with 900 images in each category. The resolution of all images was standardized to 224 \u00d7 224 \u00d7 3 pixels.\n\nFor the training and testing phases, the dataset was split such that 70% of the total images (2430 images) were used for training, and the remaining 30% (270 images) were used for testing.

  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in our work is an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifier. This classifier is integrated with a deep learning network, forming the basis of our E-DiCoNet model. The ELM classifier is not entirely new, but its application in this specific context, combined with a deep learning network for COVID-19 diagnosis, is innovative.\n\nThe ELM classifier is chosen for its efficiency and simplicity. It uses a single layer of hidden neurons with randomly initialized weights and biases, which are not iteratively tuned. Instead, the output weights are analytically calculated using the generalized least square method. This non-iterative approach significantly reduces training time compared to traditional backpropagation-based methods.\n\nThe reason this work was not published in a machine-learning journal is that the primary focus is on the application of machine learning techniques to medical diagnosis, specifically the diagnosis of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. The integration of ELM with deep learning networks for this particular medical application is the novel contribution. The model's performance metrics, such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, demonstrate its effectiveness in diagnosing COVID-19, making it a valuable tool for clinicians. The emphasis is on the practical application and the improvement in diagnostic accuracy rather than the development of a new machine-learning algorithm per se.",
  "optimization/meta": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, the data encoding and preprocessing steps were crucial for ensuring the effectiveness of our machine-learning algorithm. We utilized chest X-ray images from publicly available repositories, which included categories for COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia. The dataset consisted of 2700 images, with 900 images in each category. All images were resized to a uniform resolution of 224 \u00d7 224 \u00d7 3 pixels. This standardization was essential for maintaining consistency across the dataset and ensuring that the deep learning model could effectively extract features.\n\nData augmentation techniques were employed to enhance the diversity of the training dataset. This involved resizing all images to the specified dimensions and converting grayscale images into color images. The augmentation process helped in preventing overfitting and improved the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.\n\nFor feature extraction, we used a modified ResNet-50 pre-trained deep learning network. This network contains 50 convolutional layers and is known for its robust feature extraction capabilities. The features were extracted just before the classification layer using activation methods. A mini-batch size of 32 was set for feature extraction, which balanced computational efficiency and model performance.\n\nThe extracted features were then fed into an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifier. ELM uses a single layer of hidden neurons with weights and biases that are randomly initialized. The output weights are analytically calculated using the generalized least square method. This approach eliminates the need for iterative tuning of weights and biases, making the training process more efficient.\n\nThe sigmoid activation function was used at the hidden layer to map the features into a non-linear space. The number of hidden units in the ELM was set to 5000, and the size of the output layer was 3, corresponding to the three classes: Normal, Pneumonia, and COVID-19. This configuration allowed the model to effectively classify the images into the appropriate categories.\n\nIn summary, the data encoding and preprocessing involved resizing and augmenting the images, extracting features using a pre-trained ResNet-50 network, and classifying the features using an ELM classifier with a sigmoid activation function. These steps ensured that the model could accurately diagnose COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia from chest X-ray images.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In the proposed E-DiCoNet model, the input parameters are primarily determined by the architecture of the deep learning network and the extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier.\n\nThe deep learning network used is a modified ResNet-50, which contains 50 convolutional layers. This network is pre-trained and fine-tuned for the specific task of classifying chest X-ray images into three categories: normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19.\n\nFor the ELM classifier, the number of hidden neurons is set to 5000. This parameter is crucial as it defines the complexity of the model. The weights and biases of the hidden layer are randomly initialized, and the output weights are analytically calculated using the generalized least square method. The sigmoid activation function is used in the hidden layer to map the features into a non-linear space.\n\nThe mini-batch size for feature extraction is set to 32, and the output layer size is 3, corresponding to the three classes being classified. These parameters were chosen based on empirical testing and optimization to achieve the best performance metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.\n\nThe selection of these parameters was influenced by the need to balance computational efficiency and model performance. The use of a pre-trained network like ResNet-50 allows for efficient feature extraction, while the ELM classifier provides a fast and effective way to classify the extracted features. The chosen parameters have been validated through extensive testing and comparison with other state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating their effectiveness in diagnosing COVID-19 from chest X-ray images.",
  "optimization/features": "The proposed model utilizes a modified ResNet-50 pre-trained deep learning network for feature extraction. The features are extracted just before the classification layer using the activations method. The output features are then fed into an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifier. The number of features used as input to the ELM classifier is equal to the number of hidden units, which is set to 5000.\n\nFeature selection was not explicitly performed in the traditional sense. Instead, the deep learning network itself acts as a feature selector by extracting relevant features from the input images. This is achieved through the convolutional layers, which apply various kernel filters to capture spatial information and invariant features from the raw images.\n\nThe dataset used for training and testing consists of chest X-ray images categorized into three classes: normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19. The images are resized to 224 \u00d7 224 \u00d7 3 pixels, and data augmentation is used to convert grayscale images into color images. The features extracted from these images are used to train the ELM classifier.\n\nThe training process involves using 70% of the total images (2430) for training and the remaining 30% (270) for testing. The dataset is partitioned randomly for training and test images. The mini-batch size for feature extraction is set to 32. The output layer of the ELM classifier has a size of 3, corresponding to the three classes.\n\nIn summary, the model leverages the feature extraction capabilities of a pre-trained deep learning network and feeds the extracted features into an ELM classifier. The number of input features to the ELM classifier is 5000, and feature selection is inherently performed by the deep learning network during the feature extraction process.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The proposed model, E-DiCoNet, employs a deep learning network (DLN) combined with an extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier. This approach leverages the feature extraction capabilities of DLN with the fast training and robust performance of ELM. The DLN used is a modified ResNet-50, which contains 50 convolutional layers, providing a rich set of features from the input images.\n\nThe ELM classifier used in this model is designed to be parameter-free, meaning it does not require iterative tuning of weights and biases. Instead, the weights and biases are randomly initialized, and the output weights are analytically calculated using the generalized least square method. This method ensures that the model does not overfit the training data, as it does not rely on iterative optimization processes that could lead to memorization of the training set.\n\nTo address the potential issue of overfitting, the model was trained on a dataset of 2700 images, with 70% used for training and 30% for testing. Data augmentation techniques were employed to resize all images to 224 \u00d7 224 \u00d7 3 and convert grayscale images into color images, effectively increasing the diversity of the training data. Additionally, the use of a sigmoid activation function in the hidden layer of the ELM helps in mapping the features into a non-linear space, which aids in capturing complex patterns without overfitting.\n\nUnderfitting was mitigated by ensuring that the model had sufficient capacity to learn from the data. The ResNet-50 architecture, with its deep convolutional layers, provides a robust feature extraction mechanism. The ELM classifier, with 5000 hidden neurons, further enhances the model's ability to learn intricate details from the images. The use of a large number of hidden neurons in the ELM ensures that the model can capture the necessary complexity in the data without being too simplistic.\n\nThe performance of the model was validated through extensive testing and comparison with other state-of-the-art methods. The proposed model achieved high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, indicating that it effectively learned from the training data without underfitting or overfitting. The model's performance metrics, such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, recall, precision, and F1 score, were thoroughly analyzed and reported, demonstrating its robustness and reliability in diagnosing COVID-19 from chest X-ray images.",
  "optimization/regularization": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters used in our study are detailed within the publication. Specifically, the network parameters, including the number of layers, activation functions, and the number of hidden neurons in the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifier, are provided in Table 2. The training and testing procedures, along with the data augmentation techniques, are thoroughly described in the implementation details section. The specific configurations, such as the mini-batch size and the output size, are also clearly stated.\n\nRegarding the availability of model files and optimization parameters, these are not explicitly provided in the publication. However, the methods and configurations are described in sufficient detail to allow for replication of the experiments. The code for the proposed algorithm was written and computed in MATLAB 2018b (R9.5), and the system configuration used for execution is specified, including the Dell Alienware system with an i7 6th gen processor, GTX 1080 GPU, and 64 GB DDR4 RAM.\n\nThe publication does not specify the license under which the code or model files might be shared. However, the detailed descriptions and parameters provided should enable researchers to implement the proposed method independently. For access to the specific model files or additional optimization parameters, interested parties may need to contact the authors directly.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model presented in this work, E-DiCoNet, leverages a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) combined with an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifier, which introduces a level of interpretability that is often lacking in purely black-box models.\n\nThe use of a DCNN for feature extraction allows the model to capture intricate patterns and details from chest X-ray images. The convolutional layers in the network act as feature detectors, identifying edges, textures, and other relevant visual elements. This process is somewhat transparent, as the activations of these layers can be visualized and interpreted to understand what features the model is focusing on.\n\nFollowing the DCNN, the ELM classifier operates with a single layer of hidden neurons, where weights and biases are randomly initialized. The output weights are then analytically calculated using the generalized least square method. This non-iterative approach means that the model's decision-making process is more straightforward compared to iterative methods like backpropagation. The ELM's weights and biases do not require tuning, which simplifies the model and makes it easier to understand how inputs are mapped to outputs.\n\nThe model's transparency is further enhanced by the use of a sigmoid activation function in the hidden layer, which maps features into a non-linear space. This activation function is well-understood and widely used, providing a clear mechanism for how the model transforms input data.\n\nAdditionally, the model's performance metrics, such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, are thoroughly evaluated and compared with state-of-the-art methods. This comparative analysis provides insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses, contributing to its interpretability.\n\nIn summary, while the DCNN component of E-DiCoNet captures complex patterns from images, the ELM classifier introduces a level of transparency through its non-iterative, analytically derived weights. This combination allows for a more interpretable model compared to traditional black-box approaches.",
  "model/output": "The model presented in this work is a classification model. It is designed to diagnose COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia conditions from chest X-ray images. The model utilizes a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for feature extraction, followed by an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifier. The ELM classifier has a single hidden layer with randomly initialized weights and biases, and it uses a sigmoid activation function to map features into a non-linear space. The output layer size is 3, corresponding to the three classes: Normal, Pneumonia, and COVID-19. The output weights are calculated analytically using the generalized least square method, which involves taking the pseudo-inverse of the output of the hidden layer and multiplying it by the target matrix. This approach eliminates the need for iterative tuning of weights and biases, making the training process more efficient. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, recall, precision, and F1 score, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying the different conditions from X-ray images.",
  "model/duration": "The model, named E-DiCoNet, demonstrates efficient execution times for both training and testing phases. During the training process, which includes data augmentation, feature extraction using transfer learning, and training the Extreme Learning Machine's (ELM) weights and biases, the model requires approximately 280.5 seconds. This training phase involves processing 630 X-ray images.\n\nFor the testing phase, the model is remarkably swift, taking only about 2.5 seconds to classify a single X-ray image using the pre-trained E-DiCoNet. This rapid testing time is a significant advantage, making the model suitable for real-time applications in COVID-19 diagnosis.\n\nThe efficiency in execution time is partly attributed to the use of a GPU, which accelerates the computational processes involved in training and testing. The model's architecture, which includes a modified ResNet-50 pre-trained deep learning network followed by an ELM classifier, contributes to its speed and accuracy. The ELM classifier, in particular, does not require iterative tuning of weights and biases, further reducing the training time.\n\nOverall, the E-DiCoNet model's execution time is optimized for quick and accurate diagnosis, making it a valuable tool in the context of COVID-19 detection using chest X-ray images.",

The specific URL for the repository is provided in the publication. The code is released under a license that allows for its use and modification, facilitating further research and development in the field of COVID-19 diagnosis using deep learning techniques.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the proposed method, E-DiCoNet, involved a comprehensive assessment using various performance metrics and comparisons with state-of-the-art techniques. The method was tested on publicly available datasets of chest X-ray images categorized into COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia.\n\nThe evaluation metrics used included accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, recall, precision, and F1 score. These metrics were chosen to provide a thorough assessment of the method's performance in classifying the images. Accuracy was calculated as the ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total number of cases. Sensitivity, also known as recall, measured the fraction of true positive predictions, while specificity measured the fraction of true negative predictions. Precision was defined as the ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives, and the F1 score was the harmonic mean of precision and recall.\n\nThe method was validated using a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, which graphically represents the performance of the classification method across all thresholds. The ROC curve utilized the true positive rate and false positive rate to evaluate the method's effectiveness.\n\nIn addition to these metrics, the method was compared with various state-of-the-art techniques, including different activation functions of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and other deep learning architectures such as ResNet, GoogleNet, InceptionNet, SqueezeNet, and AlexNet.

These comparisons were conducted using the same dataset, and the results showed that the proposed method achieved better accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity values.\n\nFurthermore, the method was evaluated using a confusion matrix, which provided a detailed breakdown of the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions. This allowed for a more granular analysis of the method's performance in classifying the different categories of chest X-ray images.\n\nOverall, the evaluation of the proposed method involved a rigorous assessment using multiple performance metrics, comparisons with state-of-the-art techniques, and detailed analyses using ROC curves and confusion matrices. The results demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in classifying chest X-ray images for the diagnosis of COVID-19.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the \"Performance Measures\" subsection, we report several key metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology for classifying chest X-ray images into COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia categories. These metrics include accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, recall, precision, and the F1 score. Additionally, we utilize the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve to provide a graphical representation of the classification performance.\n\nAccuracy measures the proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total number of cases. Sensitivity, also known as recall, indicates the fraction of true positive instances correctly identified by the model. Specificity measures the fraction of true negative instances correctly identified. Precision, or the positive predictive value, assesses the proportion of relevant instances among the retrieved cases. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both concerns.\n\nThese metrics are widely used in the literature for evaluating classification models, particularly in medical imaging. They offer a comprehensive view of the model's performance, covering aspects such as the correct identification of positive and negative cases, as well as the balance between precision and recall. The ROC curve further enhances this evaluation by illustrating the trade-off between the true positive rate and the false positive rate across different threshold settings.\n\nBy reporting these metrics, we aim to provide a clear and representative assessment of our model's performance, aligning with standard practices in the field. This set of metrics ensures that our evaluation is thorough and comparable to other studies in medical image classification.",

The Sigmoid activation function was found to provide the best performance values among these comparisons.\n\nAdditionally, the proposed method was validated against five standard pre-trained networks: ResNet, GoogleNet, InceptionNet, SqueezeNet, and AlexNet. The performance metrics, including accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision, and F1 score, were analyzed and reported. The proposed method outperformed these pre-trained networks in terms of classification accuracy, particularly for COVID-19 images.\n\nThe comparison with simpler baselines was not applicable, as the focus was on evaluating the proposed method against advanced and state-of-the-art techniques. The results indicate that the proposed E-DiCoNet method is reliable for diagnosing COVID-19 in real-time applications.",
