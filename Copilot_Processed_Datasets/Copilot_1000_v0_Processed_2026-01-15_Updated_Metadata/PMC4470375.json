  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset utilized in this study originates from experiments conducted using RealSkin, a full-thickness skin model from EpiSkin\u2122. This model consists of a dermal equivalent with a lattice of acid-soluble collagen and normal human adult fibroblasts, overlaid by a stratified, well-differentiated epidermis layer derived from normal human adult skin. The RealSkin kit, including the tissue model and its respective culture medium, was provided by EpiSkin\u2122 as a donation from L\u2019Oreal.\n\nThe study involved a panel of chemicals, including an irritant (salicylic acid), a moderate pro-hapten sensitizer (isoeugenol), and a strong pre-hapten (p-phenylenediamine). These chemicals were selected as representative pre- and pro-haptens and were purchased from Sigma\u2013Aldrich. The stock solutions were prepared in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and subsequently diluted to their final working concentrations using RPMI cell culture medium. The final concentration of DMSO was maintained at 0.4% across all conditions.\n\nThe secretome from the post-sensitized cultures was evaluated using hierarchical cluster analysis and support vector machine (SVM) classification tools. The dataset included measurements of various cytokines and growth factors, such as IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-7, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, Eotaxin, Basic FGF, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IFN\u03b3, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, PDGF-BB, RANTES, TNF\u03b1, and VEGF, using a Bioplex Assay.\n\nThe study involved a small panel of sensitizers as a proof of concept. The classifier accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were all greater than 90% when the best secreted features were selected based on this panel. This supports the notion that a molecular signature or a battery of assays needs to be implemented together to correctly identify potential contact allergens.\n\nThe true predictive power of the specific molecular signature will need to undergo validation studies with an expanded panel of chemicals. However, the accuracy of the classification model suggests that the identified signature validates the feature selection method by SVM and the need to use a panel of several metrics. As more chemicals are evaluated, it is feasible that the number of predictive metrics may expand.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in our study is Support Vector Machine (SVM). SVM is a well-established supervised learning method primarily used for classification tasks. It is not a new algorithm; it has been extensively used in various fields, including bioinformatics and pattern recognition, due to its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional spaces and its ability to perform well with clear margin of separation.\n\nThe reason SVM was not published in a machine-learning journal in this context is that the focus of our work was not on developing a new machine-learning algorithm but rather on applying an existing, robust method to a specific biological problem. Our primary goal was to utilize SVM as a feature selection tool to identify key cytokines that could distinguish between sensitizing and non-sensitizing chemicals. This application is more aligned with the domain of toxicology and biological sciences, where the emphasis is on understanding biological mechanisms and developing predictive models for chemical sensitization.\n\nBy employing SVM, we were able to rank cytokines based on their ability to separate the two classes of chemicals, thereby identifying a molecular signature that could be used to build a predictive classification model. This approach demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional feature selection methods, highlighting the utility of SVM in biological research.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model described in the publication does not function as a meta-predictor. Instead, it relies on a single machine-learning algorithm, specifically a support vector machine (SVM), to build a predictive classification model for skin sensitization. The SVM is used to analyze data from a Bioplex screen of cytokines, with feature selection methods such as ranking margin distances and p-values from ANOVA identifying key cytokines like IL-12, IL-9, VEGF, and IFN-\u03b3. These selected features are then used to train the SVM classifier, which is evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation to determine its accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.\n\nThe model does not incorporate data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. The feature selection process is integrated within the SVM framework, utilizing statistical methods to identify the most relevant cytokines. The training data for the SVM includes various treatment conditions and their respective concentrations, ensuring that the model is trained on a diverse set of biological information. The independence of the training data is maintained through the use of 10-fold cross-validation, which helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model generalizes well to new data.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, the data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several key steps. Initially, we utilized a Bioplex Assay to measure the concentrations of various cytokines and growth factors. These measurements were then normalized to the vehicle-treated cultures to ensure consistency across different samples.\n\nFor the support vector machine (SVM) analysis, the data was encoded such that each cytokine's concentration was represented as a feature vector. The training data for each cytokine was structured as pairs of {xi, yi}, where xi denotes the cytokine concentration and yi corresponds to the label of the chemical. The labels were assigned as -1 for non-sensitizers and 1 for sensitizers. This binary classification allowed the SVM to distinguish between the two classes effectively.\n\nThe SVM utilized a linear kernel to find the hyperplane that best separated the sensitizers from the non-sensitizers. The goal was to maximize the margin distance between the two classes, which was achieved by minimizing the norm of the weight vector w subject to specific constraints. These constraints ensured that the hyperplane correctly classified the training data points.\n\nAdditionally, we performed hierarchical cluster analysis as an unsupervised feature selection method. This involved normalizing the secretome data from the Bioplex Assay and then applying agglomerative hierarchical clustering in Matlab. This method helped in identifying patterns and grouping similar data points together, which aided in feature selection.\n\nStatistical analysis was also conducted to ensure the robustness of our findings. All data was presented as mean \u00b1 standard error, and we based our analysis on at least three independent biological replicates. This rigorous approach ensured that our results were reliable and reproducible.\n\nIn summary, the data encoding and preprocessing involved normalization of cytokine concentrations, binary labeling for SVM, and the use of hierarchical clustering for feature selection. These steps were crucial in preparing the data for the machine-learning algorithm and ensuring accurate and reliable results.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized a support vector machine (SVM) for building a predictive model of skin sensitization. The number of parameters, p, used in the model varied depending on the feature selection method employed.\n\nInitially, we attempted to build a model using all 27 cytokines measured by the Bioplex assay. However, this approach yielded poor classification performance. To improve the model, we employed several feature selection methods, including ranking margin distances from the SVM, p-values determined from ANOVA, hierarchical cluster analysis, and ranking accuracies computed from the SVM.\n\nThrough these feature selection methods, we identified a molecular signature consisting of four cytokines: IL-12, IL-9, VEGF, and IFN-\u03b3. This reduced set of parameters significantly improved the model's performance, achieving high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.\n\nThe selection of the optimal number of parameters was driven by the goal of maximizing the model's predictive performance. By systematically ranking the margin distances and accuracy values, we identified the most informative cytokines for distinguishing sensitizers. This approach allowed us to balance model complexity and performance, ensuring that the final model was both accurate and efficient.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we initially considered a panel of 27 cytokines as potential input features for our classification model. These cytokines were measured using a Bioplex Assay. However, we recognized the importance of feature selection to enhance the model's performance.\n\nFeature selection was indeed performed using various methods, including ranking margin distances from a support vector machine (SVM), p-values determined from ANOVA, hierarchical cluster analysis, and ranking accuracies computed from the SVM. These methods were applied to identify the most relevant cytokines for predicting skin sensitization.\n\nTo ensure the robustness of our feature selection process, we used the training set only. This approach helped us to avoid overfitting and to generalize the model's performance to unseen data. Through this process, we identified a molecular signature consisting of four cytokines: IL-12, IL-9, VEGF, and IFN-\u03b3. This selected panel of cytokines demonstrated superior classification performance compared to using all 27 cytokines or other feature selection methods.\n\nThe use of feature selection not only improved the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of our classification model but also provided a more interpretable set of biomarkers for skin sensitization. This approach allowed us to focus on the most informative cytokines, making the model more efficient and effective.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study utilized a support vector machine (SVM) for classification, which is particularly robust in handling high-dimensional spaces. The number of parameters, in this case, the cytokines measured, was indeed larger than the number of training points. To address potential over-fitting, several strategies were implemented.\n\nFirstly, feature selection methods such as hierarchical cluster analysis and ranking of margin distances from the SVM were used to identify the most relevant cytokines. This reduced the dimensionality of the data, focusing on the most informative features and thereby mitigating the risk of over-fitting.\n\nSecondly, 10-fold cross-validation was employed to assess the model's performance. This technique involves dividing the data into 10 subsets, training the model on 9 subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated 10 times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. This approach ensures that the model's performance is evaluated on unseen data, providing a more reliable estimate of its generalization capability.\n\nAdditionally, the model's performance was compared across different feature selection methods, including p-values from ANOVA and accuracies computed from the SVM. The consistency in performance across these methods further validates the robustness of the model and rules out over-fitting.\n\nTo address under-fitting, the model's complexity was carefully tuned. The use of a linear kernel in the SVM ensures that the model is capable of capturing linear relationships in the data. Moreover, the systematic ranking of margin distances and accuracy values ensured that the model was not overly simplistic, capturing the necessary complexity to distinguish between sensitizers and non-sensitizers.\n\nThe superior performance of the model built using the co-culture system, which preserves dynamic cellular interactions, further supports the adequacy of the fitting method. The model's ability to correctly predict both moderate and strong sensitizers, as well as its high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, indicates that under-fitting was effectively avoided.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed support vector machine (SVM) as a feature selection method, which inherently includes a form of regularization to prevent overfitting. The SVM approach we used determines the best discriminative metrics between two classes of chemicals (sensitizing vs. non-sensitizing) by finding the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the classes. This process involves minimizing the norm of the weight vector (w), which acts as a regularization term. By doing so, we ensure that the model is not overly complex and can generalize well to unseen data.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized 10-fold cross-validation to assess the model's performance. This technique helps in evaluating the model's ability to generalize to new data by splitting the data into training and validation sets multiple times. This process aids in preventing overfitting by ensuring that the model is not merely memorizing the training data but is learning the underlying patterns.\n\nFurthermore, we compared different feature selection methods, including hierarchical cluster analysis and ranking based on p-values from ANOVA. These methods helped in identifying the most relevant cytokines for building the classification model, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting by focusing on the most informative features.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in our study is not a blackbox. It utilizes a support vector machine (SVM), which is inherently interpretable due to its ability to identify support vectors and margin distances. These support vectors are the critical data points that lie closest to the decision boundary, or hyperplane, which separates the classes of sensitizers and non-sensitizers. By examining these support vectors, one can gain insights into which specific data points are most influential in the classification process.\n\nThe margin distance, which is the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points from each class, provides a quantitative measure of how well the classes are separated. A larger margin distance indicates better separation and, consequently, a more robust model. This margin distance can be computed for each cytokine, allowing for a ranking of cytokines based on their discriminative power.\n\nFor instance, in our analysis, IL-12 was identified as having the greatest margin distance, indicating it is the most effective cytokine for distinguishing between sensitizers and non-sensitizers. This interpretability allows researchers to understand not only the model's predictions but also the underlying biological mechanisms driving those predictions. The use of SVM as a feature selection tool further enhances interpretability by enabling the ranking of individual metrics and accounting for dependencies among features, which traditional statistical methods may overlook. This approach provides a clear and quantifiable way to identify the most relevant biomarkers for skin sensitization.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a classification model. It is designed to predict skin sensitization, distinguishing between sensitizing and non-sensitizing chemicals. The model utilizes a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, which is a supervised learning method commonly used for classification tasks. The performance of the model was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, which are typical for classification models. The model was built using various feature selection methods to identify key cytokines that serve as a molecular signature for skin sensitization. The final model, which includes cytokines like IL-12, IL-9, VEGF, and IFN-\u03b3, demonstrated superior classification performance compared to models using other feature selection methods or individual cytokines. The use of 10-fold cross-validation further ensures the robustness of the classification model.",

  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method employed for the classification model involved a rigorous approach to ensure its predictive accuracy and robustness. The primary technique used was 10-fold cross-validation, which is a standard method in machine learning for assessing model performance. This technique involves dividing the dataset into 10 subsets, training the model on 9 of these subsets, and then testing it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated 10 times, with each subset serving as the test set once, and the results are averaged to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance.\n\nThe metrics used to evaluate the model's performance included accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Accuracy measures the proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined. Sensitivity, also known as the true positive rate, indicates the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified by the model. Specificity, or the true negative rate, represents the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified.\n\nThe evaluation was conducted using various feature selection methods, including ranking margin distances from the support vector machine (SVM) and p-values determined from ANOVA. These methods helped identify key cytokines such as IL-12, IL-9, VEGF, and IFN-\u03b3, which were used to build the classification model. The performance of the model was compared against other feature selection methods, such as hierarchical cluster analysis, to ensure that the chosen approach was superior.\n\nAdditionally, the evaluation included all treatment conditions (untreated, vehicle, SA, IE, and PPD) and their respective concentrations, with data collected from at least 3 independent replicates. This ensured that the model's performance was assessed under a wide range of conditions, enhancing the reliability of the results. The use of a co-culture system involving RealSkin and MUTZ-3 derived Langerhan\u2019s cells further improved the in vivo-like nature of the assay, providing a more accurate representation of skin sensitization processes.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we focused on several key performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of our support vector machine (SVM) classification model in identifying skin sensitizers. The primary metrics we reported include accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. These metrics were determined using a 10-fold cross-validation approach, ensuring a robust evaluation of our model's performance.\n\nAccuracy measures the overall correctness of the model, representing the proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined. Sensitivity, also known as recall, indicates the model's ability to correctly identify sensitizers, which is crucial for ensuring that potential sensitizers are not missed. Specificity, on the other hand, measures the model's ability to correctly identify non-sensitizers, reducing the likelihood of false positives.\n\nIn addition to these metrics, we also considered the margin distance, which quantifies the separation between non-sensitizer and sensitizer groups. This metric helps in understanding the robustness of the model's decision boundary. Furthermore, we reported p-values obtained from ANOVA to assess the statistical significance of the differences observed between the groups.\n\nOur choice of metrics is representative of standard practices in the field. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are commonly used in machine learning and biological studies to evaluate classification models. The inclusion of margin distance and p-values adds an extra layer of rigor, ensuring that our findings are statistically sound and biologically relevant.\n\nBy reporting these metrics, we aim to provide a comprehensive evaluation of our model's performance, demonstrating its potential to accurately identify skin sensitizers and contribute to the development of predictive in vitro assays.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we conducted a thorough comparison of various methods to evaluate their performance in predicting skin sensitization. We utilized a support vector machine (SVM) as our primary classification model and compared it with other feature selection methods such as hierarchical cluster analysis and ranking based on p-values from ANOVA.\n\nWe assessed the performance of these methods using metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity through 10-fold cross-validation. Initially, using all 27 cytokines from the Bioplex without any feature selection resulted in poor classification performance, with an accuracy of 75%, sensitivity of 67%, and specificity of 83%. This indicated the necessity of feature selection to improve the model's predictive power.\n\nFeature selection by ranking margin distances from the SVM and p-values from ANOVA identified a molecular signature consisting of IL-12, IL-9, VEGF, and IFN-\u03b3. This signature significantly enhanced the classification performance, achieving an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 92%. Similarly, hierarchical cluster analysis identified a panel of cytokines (IL-4, IL-9, IL-12, VEGF) that also performed well, with an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 91.67%.\n\nWe also compared our SVM-based feature selection approach with traditional statistical methods. While traditional methods like ANOVA and hierarchical cluster analysis validated our approach, SVM offered additional benefits. SVM accounts for dependencies among features, enables quantitative ranking of individual metrics, interacts with the classifier, and provides superior computational complexity. This interaction with the classifier is crucial as the model is progressively trained with more biological information, expanding the panel of chemicals and cellular metrics.\n\nFurthermore, we explored the use of a co-culture system involving RealSkin and MUTZ-LCs, which showed superior assay performance in predicting both moderate and strong sensitizers. This system preserved dynamic cellular interactions, leading to more accurate predictions.\n\nIn summary, our comparison of methods demonstrated that SVM-based feature selection, combined with a co-culture system, provides a robust and accurate approach for predicting skin sensitization. This method outperforms simpler baselines and publicly available methods, offering a more comprehensive and reliable tool for identifying sensitizers.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the support vector machine (SVM) classification model for skin sensitization prediction was conducted using 10-fold cross-validation, which provides a robust measure of the model's performance. The performance metrics reported include accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, which are crucial for assessing the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between sensitizers and non-sensitizers.\n\nThe statistical significance of the results was determined using ANOVA, which helps in identifying the metrics that contribute most significantly to the classification performance. The p-values associated with each metric indicate the level of confidence in the results. For instance, metrics like IL-12, IL-9, and VEGF have p-values that are highly significant (\u2264 0.05), suggesting that these metrics are reliable indicators of skin sensitization.\n\nThe margin distances quantified by the SVM also play a critical role in feature selection. Metrics with greater margin distances are more effective in separating sensitizers from non-sensitizers, and these distances are used to rank the importance of each metric. The top-ranked metrics, such as IL-12, IL-9, VEGF, and IFN-\u03b3, consistently show high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, further validating their significance.\n\nThe comparison of different feature selection methods, including hierarchical cluster analysis and ranking by accuracy, shows that the SVM-based feature selection method yields the best performance. The model built using the top metrics identified by SVM margin distances and p-values achieves an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 92%, which is superior to models built using other feature selection methods or individual metrics alone.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics are supported by statistical significance tests, and the results demonstrate that the SVM-based classification model is superior to other methods and baselines. The use of margin distances and p-values provides a confident evaluation of the model's effectiveness in predicting skin sensitization.",
