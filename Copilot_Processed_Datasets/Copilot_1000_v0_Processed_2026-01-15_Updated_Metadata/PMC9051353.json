  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in our study was derived from a cohort of 716 patients who underwent extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) for urinary stones. This dataset was collected from patients treated with ESWL, focusing on various parameters that could influence the treatment's efficacy and complications.\n\nThe data points included in the dataset encompassed a range of variables such as age, body mass index (BMI), stone location, stone size, comorbidities, previous ESWL sessions, analgesia use, number of shocks delivered, intensity, presence of a pig-tail catheter, and hydronephrosis. These variables were selected based on their statistical significance in univariate and multivariate analyses, which revealed their impact on ESWL outcomes.\n\nThe dataset was divided into two sets: a training set consisting of 549 patients and an evaluation set of 167 patients. This division was intended to maintain an equal frequency of outcomes in each set, ensuring a balanced evaluation of the neural network's performance.\n\nThe variables were carefully chosen to include those commonly used in clinical practice before ESWL sessions. Parameters such as stone-to-skin distance (SSD) and ureteral wall thickness were not included due to their dependence on the radiologist's experience and the lack of routine CT imaging before lithotripsy. However, it is acknowledged that including SSD and stone hardness based on CT imaging could potentially improve the predictive accuracy of the neural network in future studies.\n\nThe dataset was used to construct an artificial neural network (ANN) aimed at predicting the outcomes and complications of ESWL treatment. The ANN was trained using the training set and evaluated using the evaluation set, demonstrating high accuracy in predicting complications and treatment efficacy. The performance of the ANN was further validated through the calculation of basic ratios such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value, which showed promising results.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into two main splits: a training set and an evaluation set. The training set consisted of 549 patients, while the evaluation set included 167 patients. The distribution was designed to maintain an equal frequency of outcomes in each set, ensuring a balanced representation of complications and non-complications. This split was crucial for training the neural network and subsequently evaluating its performance on unseen data.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset used in this study consisted of data from 716 patients who underwent extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) for urinary stones. The dataset was divided into two sets: a training set and an evaluation set. The training set included data from 549 patients, while the evaluation set contained data from 167 patients. This split was designed to maintain an equal frequency of outcomes in each set, ensuring that both sets were representative of the overall patient population.\n\nThe training and evaluation sets were independent, meaning that the data used for training the neural network did not overlap with the data used for evaluating its performance. This independence was crucial for assessing the generalizability of the model, as it allowed for an unbiased evaluation of the network's predictive accuracy.\n\nTo enforce the independence of the training and evaluation sets, the data was carefully partitioned. The training set was used to train the neural network, allowing it to learn patterns and relationships within the data. The evaluation set, on the other hand, was used to test the network's performance on unseen data, providing a measure of how well the network could generalize to new cases.\n\nThe distribution of the dataset compares favorably to previously published machine learning datasets in the medical field. The use of a diverse set of input variables, including demographic information, stone characteristics, and treatment parameters, ensured that the dataset was comprehensive and representative of the factors that influence the outcome of ESWL. This approach aligns with best practices in machine learning, where the inclusion of a wide range of relevant variables is essential for building robust and accurate predictive models.",
  "dataset/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in our study is artificial neural networks (ANNs), specifically multiple layer perceptrons. These networks are trained using a supervised learning approach with error back-propagation algorithms. This method is well-established and has been successfully implemented to solve a variety of complex problems.\n\nThe algorithm used is not new; it has been widely used and studied in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The error back-propagation algorithm is based on the error-correction learning rule and is a generalization of the least mean square algorithm. It involves a forward and backward passage through the network layers to adjust synaptic weights and minimize errors.\n\nThe reason this algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that our focus is on applying established machine-learning techniques to a specific medical problem rather than developing new algorithms. Our study aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of ANNs in predicting urinary lithiasis treatment outcomes, leveraging the strengths of these well-known algorithms in a novel medical context. This approach aligns with the goals of medical research, which often involves adapting existing technologies to address specific clinical challenges.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model described in this publication does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. It is a standalone artificial neural network (ANN) designed to predict the outcome and complications of extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) treatment for urinary stones.\n\nThe ANN was constructed using a dataset of 12 variables, including stone location, stone size, body mass index (BMI), age, sex, and other relevant parameters. The network was trained using a subset of patients' data and evaluated on a separate set to ensure the independence of the training and evaluation data. This approach helps in assessing the model's ability to generalize and predict outcomes for new, unseen cases.\n\nThe training process involved using all 12 parameters as inputs, which significantly improved the network's performance compared to using a subset of variables. The final performance of the ANN in the evaluation set was 81.43%, indicating high accuracy in predicting complications. The input given the greatest weight by the ANN was the stone location, followed by other variables like BMI and stone size.\n\nThe study emphasizes the importance of using a comprehensive set of inputs to enhance the predictive power of the ANN. The independence of the training and evaluation datasets was maintained to ensure that the model's performance is reliable and not overfitted to the training data. This approach is crucial for developing a robust predictive model that can be applied in clinical settings to improve the outcomes of ESWL treatment.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the artificial neural network (ANN) used in our study, data encoding and preprocessing were crucial steps to ensure the model's effectiveness. The input variables were carefully selected and encoded to facilitate the learning process. Variables such as age, body mass index (BMI), and stone size were included with their initial numerical values. Categorical variables like stone location, intensity, and analgesia were encoded using binary values, where 1 indicated the presence of the category and 0 indicated its absence. For example, the \"sex\" variable was encoded as 1 for female patients and 0 for male patients. Stone location was encoded using binary values to denote the presence of the stone in specific organs within the renal system. If a stone was present in the right kidney, the encoding would be (1, 0, 0, 0, 0), and similarly for other locations. This method was also applied to comorbidities, ensuring that each category was distinctly represented in the input layer.\n\nThe input layer of the ANN was designed to accommodate the maximum number of neurons required, which was 20 in this case. This design allowed for the inclusion of all relevant variables and their encoded values. The hidden layer consisted of 20 neurons, which were determined to provide the best network performance after careful evaluation. The output layer had a single neuron that indicated the presence or absence of complications, with a value of 1 for complications and 0 for no complications.\n\nTransfer functions and training functions were set to the default options available in MATLAB, ensuring a standardized approach to the neural network's operation. The data from 716 patients were divided into a training set of 549 patients and an evaluation set of 167 patients, maintaining an equal frequency of outcomes in each set. This division was essential for training the network and evaluating its performance accurately. The preprocessing steps, including data encoding and normalization, were vital in preparing the data for the ANN, enabling it to learn patterns and make accurate predictions.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we initially considered a subset of parameters for input into the neural network, specifically focusing on variables such as ureter, age, and sex. However, we found that using this limited set of parameters yielded poor outcomes during the evaluation phase. To improve the model's performance, we expanded the input parameters to include a total of 12 variables. This expansion significantly enhanced the network's predictive accuracy in both the training and evaluation phases.\n\nThe selection of these 12 parameters was based on a comprehensive analysis of statistically significant variables identified through univariate and multivariate analyses. These variables included demographic factors like age and sex, as well as clinical factors such as stone location, stone size, body mass index (BMI), and the presence of comorbidities. Additionally, procedural factors like the number and density of shockwaves delivered, the use of analgesia, and the existence of a stent in the ureter were also considered. Each of these variables was carefully chosen for its potential impact on the efficacy and complications of extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL).\n\nThe input layer of the artificial neural network (ANN) was designed to accommodate these 12 parameters, with each variable contributing to the network's ability to predict outcomes accurately. For categorical variables like stone location and comorbidity, binary values were used to denote the presence or absence of specific conditions. For continuous variables like age, BMI, and stone size, their initial values were directly inputted into the network. This approach allowed the ANN to effectively process and integrate a diverse set of input data, leading to improved predictive performance.\n\nIn summary, the selection of 12 input parameters was driven by a thorough statistical analysis and a desire to capture the most relevant factors influencing ESWL outcomes. This comprehensive approach enabled the ANN to achieve high accuracy in predicting complications and efficacy, making it a robust tool for medical diagnosis and treatment planning.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized a total of 12 input features for the artificial neural network (ANN). These features were carefully selected based on their statistical significance as determined through univariate and multivariate analyses. The features included demographic information such as age and sex, as well as clinical parameters like body mass index (BMI), stone location, stone size, comorbidity, previous extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) sessions, analgesia, number of shocks, intensity, and the existence of a pig-tail catheter.\n\nFeature selection was indeed performed to ensure that only the most relevant variables were included in the model. This process involved evaluating various parameters that are commonly considered in clinical practice before an ESWL session. The selection was based on the results of univariate and multivariate analyses, which identified variables that had a significant impact on the outcomes of ESWL treatments.\n\nTo maintain the integrity of the evaluation process, feature selection was conducted using the training set only. This approach helps to prevent data leakage and ensures that the model's performance on the evaluation set is a true reflection of its generalizability to new, unseen data. By limiting the feature selection to the training set, we aimed to create a robust model that can accurately predict complications and outcomes in clinical settings.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in our study involved the use of an artificial neural network (ANN) to evaluate several parameters of extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL). Initially, a subset of patients was used with a limited number of inputs, which resulted in poor evaluation outcomes despite excellent training results. This indicated a potential overfitting issue, where the model performed well on training data but failed to generalize to new data.\n\nTo address this, we expanded the input parameters to include all 12 relevant variables. This increase in the number of inputs improved the model's performance in both training and evaluation phases, suggesting better generalization. The final ANN structure consisted of an input layer with up to 20 neurons, a hidden layer with 20 neurons, and an output layer with one neuron. This configuration was determined through careful evaluation and tuning to achieve the best network performance.\n\nThe training process utilized error back-propagation algorithms, which are designed to minimize errors by adjusting synaptic weights based on the difference between predicted and actual outcomes. This method helps in preventing overfitting by ensuring that the model learns from a diverse set of training examples and generalizes well to new data.\n\nTo rule out underfitting, we ensured that the model was complex enough to capture the underlying patterns in the data. The use of a sufficient number of hidden neurons and the inclusion of all relevant input variables helped in achieving this. The model's high accuracy in predicting complications (81.43%) and its high positive predictive value (83.82%) indicate that it effectively learned the necessary patterns without being too simplistic.\n\nIn summary, the fitting method involved using a comprehensive set of input variables and a well-tuned ANN structure. Error back-propagation was employed to minimize errors and improve generalization, while the model's complexity was carefully managed to avoid both overfitting and underfitting.",
  "optimization/regularization": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in our study is primarily a black-box model, which means that the internal workings of the artificial neural network (ANN) are not easily interpretable. This is a common characteristic of neural networks, where the relationships between inputs and outputs are learned through complex, non-linear transformations that are not straightforward to decipher.\n\nHowever, some level of interpretability can be achieved by examining the weights assigned to different input variables. In our ANN, the input given the greatest weight was the stone location, indicating its significant influence on the model's predictions. Body Mass Index (BMI) was also found to be important, ranking fourth in terms of significance. Interestingly, stone size was given a negative weight, which might be due to the specific characteristics of our training dataset or the linearity of the size measurements used.\n\nWhile these insights provide some understanding of the model's decision-making process, they do not fully explain the intricate interactions within the neural network. The ANN's ability to identify patterns and make predictions is based on a large number of interconnected nodes and layers, making it challenging to trace the exact path from inputs to outputs. This lack of transparency is a trade-off for the model's ability to capture complex relationships in the data, which conventional statistical methods might miss.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in our study is a classification model. It is designed to predict the outcome and potential complications of extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) treatment for urinary stones. The artificial neural network (ANN) was trained and evaluated using a dataset of 716 patients, with various parameters such as stone location, stone size, and body mass index (BMI) serving as inputs. The performance of the ANN was assessed using four basic ratios: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. The model achieved an accuracy of 81.43% in predicting complications, indicating its effectiveness in classifying the likelihood of treatment outcomes and side effects. The high positive predictive value of 83.82% further supports the model's reliability in predicting complications, making it a promising tool for medical diagnosis and treatment planning.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the artificial neural network (ANN) involved a comprehensive assessment of its performance using both training and evaluation datasets. Initially, a subset of patients with fewer parameters was used, which yielded excellent outcomes during training but poor results during evaluation. This indicated that the model was overfitting to the training data. To address this, all 12 parameters were included, leading to improved outcomes in both training and evaluation phases. The final dataset consisted of 12 variables, and the ANN's performance was measured by comparing predictive values to real values. The training state reached a high accuracy of 98.72%. The evaluation set showed an accuracy of 81.43% in predicting complications, with a high positive predictive value of 83.82%. This suggests that the ANN is highly effective in predicting complications associated with extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) treatment for urinary stones. The key input variables, such as stone location and body mass index (BMI), were given significant weight by the ANN, indicating their importance in the prediction model. The evaluation process involved calculating the four basic ratios: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value, for both training and evaluation datasets. This thorough evaluation demonstrates the ANN's robustness and reliability in predicting ESWL outcomes and complications.",
  "evaluation/measure": "The performance of the artificial neural network (ANN) was evaluated using several key metrics to ensure a comprehensive assessment. The four basic ratios calculated were sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. These metrics were determined for both the training and evaluation datasets, providing a robust measure of the ANN's performance.\n\nThe ANN demonstrated high accuracy in predicting complications, achieving an 81.43% accuracy in the evaluation set. Additionally, the positive predictive value was reported as 83.82%, indicating a strong likelihood of correctly predicting complications. This set of metrics is representative of standard practices in the literature, where sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values are commonly used to evaluate the performance of predictive models in medical applications. The high positive predictive value, in particular, underscores the reliability of the ANN in clinical settings, making it a promising tool for predicting outcomes and side effects in extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) treatment for urinary stones.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we did not perform a direct comparison with publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. Instead, our focus was on evaluating the performance of our artificial neural network (ANN) within the specific context of predicting outcomes and complications of extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) for urinary stones.\n\nHowever, we did compare the performance of our ANN using different sets of inputs. Initially, we used a subset of parameters, which resulted in poor evaluation outcomes. When all 12 parameters were included, the performance improved significantly, both in training and evaluation. This indicated that our ANN benefited from a larger number of inputs, suggesting that the algorithm's effectiveness increases with more comprehensive data.\n\nRegarding simpler baselines, our approach was to leverage commonly used parameters in clinical practice before ESWL sessions. We did not explicitly compare our ANN to simpler statistical models or baselines. Instead, we aimed to build a predictive model that could be practically applied in a clinical setting, using readily available data.\n\nThe performance of our ANN reached 81.43% accuracy in predicting complications, with a high positive predictive value of 83.82%. This suggests that our model is promising for clinical use, although further validation with larger datasets and comparisons to other predictive models would be beneficial.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the artificial neural network (ANN) demonstrated high accuracy in predicting complications associated with extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) for urinary stones.

The ANN achieved an accuracy of 81.43% in the evaluation set, with a high positive predictive value of 83.82%. This indicates a strong likelihood of accurately predicting complications using the neural network.\n\nThe study utilized a dataset of 12 variables to construct the ANN, which significantly improved the network's performance compared to using fewer parameters.

The use of multiple inputs enhanced the network's ability to generalize and adapt to new data, further validating its reliability.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation confidence of the ANN is high, supported by robust performance metrics and statistical significance. The network's ability to predict complications with high accuracy makes it a promising tool for improving the outcomes of ESWL treatment for urinary stones.",
