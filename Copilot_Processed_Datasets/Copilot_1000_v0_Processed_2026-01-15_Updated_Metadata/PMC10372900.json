  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from two open-source nationwide-level databases: Procedimientos and Egresos Hospitalarios. These databases provide health data from public hospitals administered by the Mexican Ministry of Health, representing approximately one-third of the country\u2019s total number of hospitals.\n\nThe Procedimientos database captures aggregated geographical and resource-related data about surgeries performed at hospitals and ambulatories. The Egresos Hospitalarios database provides de-identified data concerning in-hospital surgical operations at the patient and clinical levels.\n\nWe extracted data from the year 2021, as it was the most recent complete year from which we could retrieve information. The dataset includes 97,234 registered surgical procedures performed at both the hospital and ambulatory levels across all 32 Mexican states, including Ciudad de M\u00e9xico. Additionally, a sample of 28,837 in-hospital procedures was analyzed to understand the demographic, geographic, and clinical characteristics of patients undergoing the included procedures.\n\nThe data used in this study has not been previously published or used by the community in the same context. The dataset is unique to this study and provides a comprehensive overview of surgical procedures in Mexican public hospitals.",
  "dataset/splits": "The study utilized data from two primary sources: the Procedimientos database and the Egresos Hospitalarios database. The Procedimientos database provided aggregated geographical and resource-related data about surgeries performed at hospitals and ambulatories, encompassing 97,234 registered surgical procedures across all 32 Mexican states, including Ciudad de M\u00e9xico. Of these, 81,173 (83.4%) procedures were performed using open techniques, and 16,061 (16.5%) using laparoscopic techniques.\n\nThe Egresos Hospitalarios database was used to analyze a sample of 28,837 in-hospital procedures. This subset was examined to understand the demographic, geographic, and clinical characteristics of patients undergoing the included procedures.\n\nThe data from 2021 was complemented with 2020 geographic information from the Mexican National Census. This combination allowed for a comprehensive analysis of the surgical procedures and their associated factors. The study did not involve additional data splits beyond these two primary datasets.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "Not applicable. The study did not involve machine learning datasets or splitting data into training and test sets. Instead, it utilized two existing databases, Procedimientos and Egresos Hospitalarios, to conduct a retrospective analysis of surgical procedures performed in Mexican public hospitals. The Procedimientos database provided aggregated geographical and resource-related data about surgeries, while Egresos Hospitalarios offered de-identified data concerning in-hospital surgical operations at the patient and clinical levels. The analysis focused on procedures from the year 2021, with geographic information supplemented from the 2020 National Census. The study did not mention any redundancy in the datasets used.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data utilized in this study were obtained from two open-source nationwide-level databases: Procedimientos and Egresos Hospitalarios. These databases provide health data from public hospitals administered by the Mexican Ministry of Health. The data from these databases are publicly available and can be accessed by researchers and the general public. The data include aggregated geographical and resource-related information about surgeries performed at hospitals and ambulatories, as well as de-identified data concerning in-hospital surgical operations at the patient and clinical levels.\n\nThe data were extracted for the year 2021, as this was the most recent complete year from which information could be retrieved. Additionally, geographic information from the 2020 Mexican National Census was used to complement the dataset. The data were queried using entry identification codes to track demographic, clinical, and geographical information about surgical procedures.\n\nThe study did not involve the creation of new data splits, as it relied on existing datasets. The data were analyzed using statistical methods and machine learning techniques to identify factors associated with the use of laparoscopic versus open surgical techniques. The results of the analysis were reported with 95% confidence intervals, and two-sided P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\n\nThe data were handled in accordance with ethical guidelines and regulations. The project was submitted to the Institutional Review Board of the Harvard Faculty of Medicine and was considered non-human subjects research. The study had no source of funding, which ensured that the findings were not influenced by external financial interests.\n\nIn summary, the data used in this study are publicly available and were accessed through open-source databases. The data were analyzed using established statistical and machine learning methods, and the results were reported in accordance with ethical guidelines and regulations.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in this study is a Random Forest model, which is a well-established ensemble learning method used for classification and regression tasks. This algorithm is not new; it has been widely used and studied in the machine learning community for many years. The Random Forest model was utilized to identify the importance of each variable in the multivariable analysis, providing a ranking of factors that is not possible by considering only P-values from the multivariable model. This approach helps in building a predictive model by incorporating the Variable Importance Plot, which visualizes the significance of each variable.\n\nThe decision to use the Random Forest model in this context was driven by its ability to handle complex datasets and provide insights into variable importance. While the Random Forest model is a standard tool in machine learning, its application in this study is tailored to the specific needs of the analysis, focusing on the factors associated with the use of laparoscopic techniques in surgical procedures. The results from the Random Forest model complement the logistic regression analyses, offering a comprehensive understanding of the variables influencing the outcome.",
  "optimization/meta": "In our study, we employed a random forest model, a machine learning-based method, to identify the importance of each variable used in the multivariable analysis. This approach allowed us to provide a ranking of factors, which is not possible by considering only P-values from the multivariable model. The random forest model helped in building a predictive model by assessing the importance of each variable.\n\nThe random forest model was used in conjunction with logistic regression, which was utilized for both univariable and multivariable analyses. The logistic regression models were developed to assess the association between various factors and the outcome variable, which in this case was whether a procedure was laparoscopic or open. All variables from the univariable analysis were incorporated into the multivariable model without using any threshold value for P-values.\n\nThe random forest model's output is visualized in a Variable Importance Plot, which ranks each variable based on its importance to the multivariable model. The mean decrease in Gini impurity index is used as a measure of variable importance. This plot provides insights into which factors are most influential in predicting the use of laparoscopic techniques.\n\nRegarding the independence of training data, it is important to note that we handled missing data through complete case analysis. This approach ensures that the data used for training the models is complete and consistent, thereby maintaining the independence of the training dataset. The analyses were performed using Stata17 and R (version 4.0.3), ensuring robust and reliable results.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the machine-learning algorithm, specifically the random forest model, the data underwent several preprocessing steps to ensure optimal performance. Categorical variables were encoded using a reference category approach, where one category was selected as the baseline for comparison. For instance, the \"No\" category was used as the reference for dichotomous variables. Continuous variables, such as the municipality population, were log-transformed to normalize their distribution. This transformation helped in mitigating the effects of outliers and ensuring that the model could effectively capture the relationships within the data.\n\nThe insurance variable, originally categorical, was converted into a dichotomous variable. Categories like \"government,\" \"employment,\" and \"other\" were combined to represent insured patients, while \"none\" and \"missing\" were grouped to indicate uninsured patients. This simplification allowed for a clearer distinction between insured and uninsured statuses, which is crucial for the analysis.\n\nMissing data were handled using complete case analysis, meaning that only cases with complete information were included in the analysis. This approach ensures that the model's predictions are based on reliable and complete datasets, reducing the risk of biased results.\n\nAdditionally, the data included various demographic, clinical, and geographic factors. Demographic factors encompassed patients' age, sex, indigenous identity, and insurance status. Clinical factors included procedure type (such as cholecystectomy, appendectomy, and inguinal hernia repair) and anesthesia technique (general, regional, local, and combined). Geographic factors considered were rural or urban settings, the Mexican region, and the municipality's population where the procedure occurred.\n\nThese preprocessing steps were essential for preparing the data for the random forest model, which was used to identify the importance of each variable in the multivariable analysis. The model provided a ranking of factors, offering insights that go beyond the traditional P-values from the multivariable logistic regression model. This comprehensive approach ensured that the machine-learning algorithm could effectively analyze the data and provide meaningful results.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized a comprehensive set of variables to build our models, encompassing demographic, clinical, and geographical factors. The specific number of parameters (p) used in the model is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred from the variables mentioned.\n\nWe included independent demographic factors such as patients' age, sex, indigenous identity, and insurance status. Clinical factors encompassed procedure type, including cholecystectomy, appendectomy, and inguinal hernia repair, as well as anesthesia technique, which included general, regional, local, and combined anesthesia. Geographical factors accounted for rural or urban settings, the Mexican region, and the municipality\u2019s population where the procedure happened.\n\nThe selection of these variables was purposeful, based on their availability in the queried databases. We did not use any threshold value in P-values for each of the variables of the univariable models to be included in the multivariable model. Instead, we incorporated all variables from the univariable analysis into the multivariable model to ensure a thorough examination of their potential impact on the use of laparoscopic techniques.\n\nAdditionally, we performed a random forest model to identify the importance of each variable used in the multivariable analysis. This approach provided a ranking of factors, which is not possible by only considering P-values from the multivariable model. The Variable Importance Plot was created to incorporate this information, highlighting the significance of each variable in predicting the use of laparoscopic techniques.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized a comprehensive set of input features to analyze the use of laparoscopic techniques across various surgical procedures. The features were carefully selected based on their availability in the queried databases and their potential relevance to the outcome of interest.\n\nThe input features included both demographic and clinical factors. Demographic factors encompassed patients' age, sex, indigenous identity, and insurance status. Clinical factors included the type of procedure (such as cholecystectomy, appendectomy, and inguinal hernia repair) and the anesthesia technique used (general, regional, local, and combined).\n\nGeographical factors were also considered, including whether the procedure was performed in a rural or urban setting, the specific Mexican region, and the population density of the municipality where the procedure took place. The variable addressing the municipality population was log-transformed to better fit the statistical models.\n\nFeature selection was not explicitly performed in the traditional sense, as we included all available and relevant variables from the univariable analysis into the multivariable model. This approach ensured that no important variables were excluded based on arbitrary thresholds. Instead, we relied on the robustness of our statistical methods, including logistic regression and a random forest model, to identify the most significant predictors.\n\nThe random forest model, in particular, was used to assess the importance of each variable in the multivariable analysis. This machine learning-based method provided a ranking of factors, which is not possible by considering P-values alone. The Variable Importance Plot was created to visualize this information, highlighting the relative importance of each feature in predicting the use of laparoscopic techniques.\n\nIn summary, we used a total of 13 input features, encompassing demographic, clinical, and geographical factors. These features were selected based on their availability and relevance, and all were included in the multivariable model without prior feature selection. The random forest model further helped in identifying the most important variables in the analysis.",
  "optimization/fitting": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed logistic regression for both univariable and multivariable analyses to assess the association between various factors and the outcome of using laparoscopic techniques. To prevent overfitting, we included all variables from the univariable analysis into the multivariable model without using any threshold value for P-values. This approach ensured that our model was comprehensive and did not exclude potentially important variables based on arbitrary significance levels.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized a random forest model, a machine learning-based method, to identify the importance of each variable used in the multivariable analysis. This method provided a ranking of factors that is not possible by considering P-values alone, thereby enhancing the robustness of our predictive model. The Variable Importance Plot, created from the random forest model, incorporated this information into our results, offering a more nuanced understanding of the variables' contributions.\n\nFurthermore, we handled missing data through complete case analysis, which helped in maintaining the integrity of our dataset and preventing potential biases that could arise from imputation methods. This rigorous approach to data handling and model building ensured that our findings were reliable and generalizable within the context of the studied population.",
  "optimization/config": "Not applicable.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not entirely a black box, as we have taken steps to ensure interpretability. We utilized logistic regression for both univariable and multivariable analyses, which is a transparent and interpretable modeling technique. This allowed us to assess the association between various factors and the outcome variable, which was whether a procedure was laparoscopic or open. The odds ratios and confidence intervals provided clear insights into the strength and direction of these associations.\n\nIn addition to logistic regression, we also implemented a random forest model, a machine learning-based method, to identify the importance of each variable used in the multivariable analysis. The random forest model helped us provide a ranking of factors, which is not possible by only considering P-values from the multivariable model. This ranking was visualized using a Variable Importance Plot, which incorporates information on the mean decrease in the Gini impurity index for each variable. This plot offers a clear example of how different variables contribute to the model's predictions, enhancing the interpretability of our findings.\n\nBy combining these approaches, we aimed to balance the predictive power of machine learning with the transparency and interpretability of statistical modeling. This dual approach allowed us to build a predictive model while also providing clear insights into the factors influencing the use of laparoscopic techniques.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in this study is a classification model, specifically logistic regression. Both univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were utilized to assess the association between various factors and the outcome variable, which is whether a procedure was performed using a laparoscopic or open technique. The glm() function from R software was used to run these logistic regression models. Additionally, a random forest model, a machine learning-based method, was also conducted to identify the importance of each variable used in the multivariable analysis. This approach provided a ranking of factors, which is not possible by considering only P-values from the multivariable model. The results were reported with 95% confidence intervals, and two-sided P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using Stata17 and R (version 4.0.3).",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "The source code for the statistical analyses was implemented using R software, specifically the glm() function for logistic regression models. Additionally, Stata17 was used for some of the analyses. The specific versions used were R version 4.0.3 and Stata17 from Statacorp LLC. The software is commercially available and can be accessed through their respective official websites. The code itself is not publicly released, but the methods and software used are standard and widely recognized in the field of statistical analysis. The analyses were conducted using complete case analysis for handling missing data. The results were reported with 95% confidence intervals and two-sided P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. No specific executable, web server, virtual machine, or container instance was released for this study.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method involved a comprehensive statistical analysis using both univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. The glm() function from R software was employed to run these models. For the univariable analysis, each variable was assessed individually to determine its association with the use of laparoscopic techniques. Variables with P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\n\nIn the multivariable analysis, all variables from the univariable models were included without applying any threshold value for P-values. This approach ensured that the multivariable model was robust and considered all potential factors influencing the use of laparoscopic techniques. The goodness-of-fit for the multivariable model was evaluated using McFadden\u2019s R\u00b2 and the Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow Goodness-of-Fit Test, which provided a chi-squared value and P-value to assess the model's fit.\n\nAdditionally, a random forest model, a machine learning-based method, was used to identify the importance of each variable in the multivariable analysis. This method provided a ranking of factors based on the Mean Decrease Gini, a measure of variable importance derived from the Gini impurity index. The Variable Importance Plot was created to visualize this information, aiding in the construction of a predictive model.\n\nMissing data were handled through complete case analysis, and results were reported with 95% confidence intervals and two-sided P-values less than 0.05, indicating statistical significance. All analyses were performed using Stata17 and R (version 4.0.3).",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed several performance metrics to evaluate the use of laparoscopic techniques across different procedures and regions. The primary outcome of interest was the proportion of laparoscopic versus open approaches for cholecystectomy, appendectomy, and inguinal hernia repair. These proportions were adjusted to 100,000 inhabitants to provide a standardized measure across different regions and states.\n\nWe utilized logistic regression models to assess the association between various factors and the likelihood of a procedure being laparoscopic. The univariable analysis provided odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each variable, indicating the strength and direction of the association. Variables with P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\n\nIn the multivariable analysis, we included all variables from the univariable analysis to build a more comprehensive model. This approach allowed us to control for confounding variables and identify independent predictors of laparoscopic procedure use. The multivariable model's goodness-of-fit was evaluated using McFadden's R\u00b2 and the Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow test, providing insights into the model's predictive accuracy.\n\nAdditionally, we conducted a random forest analysis to rank the importance of each variable in predicting the use of laparoscopic techniques. This machine learning-based method complemented the logistic regression analysis by offering a different perspective on variable importance, which is not solely based on P-values.\n\nThe reported metrics are representative of standard practices in epidemiological studies, particularly those focusing on surgical techniques and healthcare utilization. The use of logistic regression and random forest models aligns with established methods in the literature for analyzing binary outcomes and identifying key predictors. The adjustment for population density and the inclusion of demographic, clinical, and geographic factors ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the factors influencing the use of laparoscopic techniques.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we did not perform a direct comparison to publicly available methods or simpler baselines on benchmark datasets. Our focus was on analyzing the use of laparoscopic versus open surgical techniques in Mexican public hospitals using nationwide-level data from the Procedimientos and Egresos Hospitalarios databases. These databases provided health data from public hospitals administered by the Mexican Ministry of Health, representing approximately one-third of the country\u2019s total number of hospitals.\n\nWe conducted a retrospective analysis of surgeries performed in these hospitals, extracting data from 2021, the most recent complete year available. The analysis included demographic, clinical, and geographical information about surgical procedures. We used logistic regression for univariable and multivariable analyses to assess the association between various factors and the use of laparoscopic techniques. Additionally, we employed a random forest model to identify the importance of each variable in the multivariable analysis.\n\nThe study design followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines, ensuring a robust methodological approach. However, the evaluation did not include a comparison with other publicly available methods or simpler baselines, as the primary objective was to understand the factors influencing the use of laparoscopic techniques in the specified context.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our study's performance metrics includes confidence intervals to provide a range within which the true effect size is likely to lie. Specifically, we report 95% confidence intervals for odds ratios, which help to understand the precision of our estimates.\n\nStatistical significance is a key aspect of our analysis. We consider P-values less than 0.05 to be statistically significant, indicating that the observed associations are unlikely to have occurred by chance. This threshold is applied consistently across our univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. For instance, in our univariable analysis, variables such as sex, indigenous ethnicity, insurance status, procedure type, rural vs. urban setting, region, anesthesia technique, and municipality population all show statistically significant associations with the use of laparoscopic techniques, as indicated by their P-values.\n\nIn the multivariable analysis, the geographical characteristics that remained positively associated with laparoscopic procedures, such as municipality population density, also show statistical significance. This rigorous approach ensures that our claims about the superiority of certain factors in predicting the use of laparoscopic techniques are robust and reliable. Additionally, the goodness-of-fit measures, such as McFadden\u2019s R\u00b2 and the Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow test, further support the validity of our models.",
  "evaluation/availability": "The raw evaluation files used in this study are not publicly available. The data was sourced from the Procedimientos and Egresos Hospitalarios databases, which provide health data from public hospitals administered by the Mexican Ministry of Health. These databases are not open-source and are not freely accessible to the public. The study utilized secondary data sources, and while the methods and results are thoroughly documented, the specific datasets used for the analysis are not released publicly. Therefore, access to the raw evaluation files is restricted and not available for external use or download."
