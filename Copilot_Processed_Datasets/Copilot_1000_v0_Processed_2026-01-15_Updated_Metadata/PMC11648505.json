  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset utilized in this study originates from the Ghana Demographic Health Survey (GDHS), specifically from five rounds conducted between 1993 and 2014. The GDHS is a nationally stratified survey that employs a multi-stage cluster sampling design, covering all ten administrative regions in Ghana. This survey is supported by various international organizations, including the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and the World Bank.\n\nThe GDHS aims to provide comprehensive information on various health metrics, such as fertility, family planning, infant and child mortality, maternal and child health, and nutrition. The surveys are designed to inform policy decisions, planning, monitoring, and evaluating health programs across the country.\n\nFor this study, data from men and women aged 15\u201349 years were merged from the surveys conducted between 2003 and 2014. The outcome measure focused on self-reported genital tract infections (sGTIs), assessed by asking participants about their experiences with sexually transmitted infections or related symptoms within the 12 months preceding the survey. The item response theory (IRT) was used to compute the outcome variable.\n\nThe dataset includes a wide range of socio-demographic characteristics, such as wealth quintile, household members, region, place of residence, sanitation, sex, age group, and educational level. These variables were considered in developing the predictive model for sGTIs.\n\nThe GDHS data has been used in previous research and by the community to understand various health dynamics in Ghana. The surveys provide a robust foundation for public health research, offering insights into the health status and needs of the population. The data used in this study is not publicly available due to restrictions, but it can be accessed from the authors upon reasonable request and with permission from the DHS.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into multiple folds for cross-validation purposes. Specifically, a tenfold cross-validation process was adopted. This means the data was split into ten different subsets, or folds. In each iteration of the cross-validation, one of these folds was used as the validation set, while the remaining nine folds were used as the training set. This process was repeated ten times, with each fold serving as the validation set exactly once. The results from each validation step were then averaged to produce a more robust estimate of the model's performance.\n\nThe distribution of data points in each fold was designed to be as balanced as possible, ensuring that each fold was representative of the overall dataset. This approach helps in assessing the model's ability to generalize to unseen data and in providing a reliable estimate of its performance metrics, such as the area under the curve (AUC).",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The study utilized data from five rounds of the Ghana Demographic Health Survey (GDHS) conducted from 1993 to 2014. The GDHS employed a cross-sectional study design with a nationally representative sample, using a two-stage sampling criteria. The first stage involved selecting clusters consisting of enumeration areas (EAs) independently within the ten administrative regions in Ghana, considering rural-urban differential characteristics. The second stage involved systematic sampling from a list of households in all the selected EAs.\n\nTo ensure the independence of training and test sets, a tenfold cross-validation process was adopted. This process divides the available data into multiple folds, using one of these folds as a validation set and training the model on the remaining folds. This process is repeated multiple times, and the results from each validation step are averaged to produce a more robust effect size estimate of the model. This method helps in managing the inherent variability and heterogeneity in the data, ensuring that the model's performance is generalizable and not overfitted to a specific subset of the data.\n\nThe distribution of the dataset compares favorably with previously published machine learning datasets in the context of public health research. The use of nationally stratified survey data ensures that the sample is representative of the population, which is crucial for the generalizability of the findings. The inclusion of various socio-demographic factors and the use of advanced statistical methods like LASSO regression and cross-validation further enhance the robustness of the model. This approach aligns with best practices in predictive modeling, ensuring that the results are reliable and applicable to real-world scenarios.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data that support the findings of this study are available from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) program. However, restrictions apply to the availability of these data, which were used under license for the current study. Therefore, the data are not publicly available. Data are available from the authors upon reasonable request and with permission of DHS. The DHS program can be accessed at https://dhsprogram.com/data/dataset_admin/login_main.cfm. This ensures that the data usage complies with the ethical guidelines and regulations set by the DHS program, maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of the participants.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in this study is the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalized regression. This is a well-established technique in the field of machine learning and statistics, known for its ability to perform both variable selection and regularization. It is particularly useful for handling high-dimensional data and mitigating issues like multicollinearity and overfitting.\n\nThe LASSO regression technique is not new; it has been extensively used in various predictive modeling tasks, including those in public health research. Its application in predicting sexually transmitted infections (STIs) has been documented in studies conducted in both the United States and Africa. For instance, Comulada et al. utilized LASSO regression to identify predictors of STIs in the United States, while Thivalapill et al. developed a predictive tool for STIs in Eswatini using the same methodology.\n\nThe reason this study did not publish in a machine-learning journal is likely because the focus is on the application of LASSO regression in the context of public health, specifically predicting self-reported genital tract infections (sGTIs) in Ghana. The primary goal is to provide insights into the contextual factors contributing to sGTIs and to enhance early detection and intervention strategies. The study leverages the predictive capabilities of LASSO regression to inform targeted interventions and policies aimed at mitigating the burden of STIs.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employed in this study does not utilize data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it relies on socio-demographic, behavioral, and environmental indicators to predict self-reported genital tract infections (sGTIs).\n\nThis model is not a meta-predictor. It specifically uses the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) penalized regression technique. LASSO is a type of linear regression that includes a penalty term to shrink some coefficient estimates to zero, effectively performing both variable selection and regularization. This approach helps in simplifying the model and improving its predictive performance by addressing issues like multicollinearity and overfitting.\n\nThe training data for the LASSO model is derived from five rounds of the Ghana Demographic Health Survey (GDHS) conducted from 1993 to 2014. The surveys employed a multi-stage cluster sampling design, ensuring that the data is independently collected across different regions and time points. This design helps in maintaining the independence of the training data, which is crucial for the reliability and generalizability of the model's predictions.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure the robustness and accuracy of the predictive model. Initially, we utilized data from five rounds of the Ghana Demographic Health Survey (GDHS) conducted between 1993 and 2014. This data was collected using a multi-stage cluster sampling design, which included both rural and urban areas across Ghana.\n\nThe primary outcome measure was self-reported genital tract infections (sGTIs), assessed through participant responses regarding their sexual history and symptoms within the 12 months preceding the survey. The item response theory (IRT) was employed to compute the outcome variable, ensuring a reliable measurement of sGTIs.\n\nFor the predictive modeling, we adopted the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalized regression approach. This method is particularly effective in handling high-dimensional data and multicollinearity, as it performs variable selection and regularization simultaneously. The LASSO regression was fitted using different values of lambda, with the best model (model 76) identified based on the smallest cross-validation mean prediction error.\n\nThe data was further processed using tenfold cross-validation to determine the optimal amount of coefficient shrinkage. This involved dividing the data into multiple folds, training the model on the remaining folds, and validating it on one fold. This process was repeated multiple times to produce a robust estimate of the model's performance.\n\nAdditionally, we controlled for the DHS sampling weight and clusters during the estimation process. This ensured that the model accounted for the complex survey design and provided accurate predictions at the community level.\n\nThe calibration belt plot analysis was used to assess the agreement between the model-predicted probabilities and the actual observed rates of sGTIs. This analysis showed that the predicted probabilities were statistically not different from the observed rates across all probabilities, indicating the model's effectiveness in capturing the relationship between higher probability scores and the presence of sGTIs.\n\nIn summary, the data encoding and preprocessing involved the use of IRT for outcome measurement, LASSO regression for variable selection and regularization, tenfold cross-validation for model optimization, and calibration belt plot analysis for model validation. These steps ensured that the predictive model was robust, accurate, and capable of identifying significant predictors of sGTIs in Ghana.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized a LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) penalized regression model to predict and select the best predictors of self-reported genital tract infections (sGTIs). The LASSO regression method is particularly useful for handling high-dimensional data and identifying the most relevant predictors by shrinking the coefficients of less important variables to zero.\n\nThe number of parameters (p) in our model was determined through a process of model building and validation. Initially, we considered 11 potential factors associated with sGTIs, including wealth quintile, number of household members, region, place of residence, sanitation, sex, age group, educational level, sexual initiation, currently working, and staying with partner. These factors were identified through an a priori review of the literature.\n\nTo select the optimal set of predictors, we employed a tenfold cross-validation technique. This process involved dividing the data into multiple folds, using one fold as a validation set and the remaining folds for training the model. This procedure was repeated multiple times, and the results were averaged to produce a robust estimate of the model's performance. The LASSO regression fits multiple models using different values of lambda, a tuning parameter that controls the amount of shrinkage applied to the coefficients. The best model was selected based on the smallest cross-validation mean prediction error.\n\nIn our final model, all variables were retained as predictors, indicating that each of the 11 initial factors contributed to the prediction of sGTIs. The best model had a mean lambda of approximately 0.01, which was determined through the cross-validation process. This approach ensured that our model was both parsimonious and effective in capturing the relationships between the predictors and the outcome variable.",
  "optimization/features": "In the optimization process, a total of 11 features were considered as potential predictors. These features were identified through a priori review of the literature and included variables such as wealth quintile, number of household members, region, place of residence, sanitation, sex, age group, educational level, sexual initiation, currently working, and staying with partner.\n\nFeature selection was performed using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) penalized regression. This method is an extension of ordinary least squares regression that adds a penalty to the residual sum of squares, effectively shrinking some coefficients to zero and thus excluding certain variables from the model. This process helps in identifying the most significant predictors and mitigating issues of multicollinearity.\n\nThe feature selection was conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the model's performance on the validation set remained unbiased. The LASSO regression fits multiple models using different values of lambda, and the best model was selected based on the smallest cross-validation mean prediction error. This approach ensures that the selected features are robust and generalizable.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) penalized regression to address the potential issue of overfitting, which can occur when the number of parameters is much larger than the number of training points. LASSO is particularly effective in handling high-dimensional data by adding a penalty to the ordinary least squares (OLS) residual sum of squares. This penalty induces shrinkage, where coefficients of less dominant variables are reduced to zero, effectively excluding them from the model. This process not only simplifies the model but also mitigates overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model.\n\nTo ensure that our model was not underfitting, we utilized tenfold cross-validation. This technique involves dividing the data into multiple folds, training the model on a subset of these folds, and validating it on the remaining fold. This process is repeated multiple times, and the results are averaged to produce a robust estimate of the model's performance. The cross-validation discriminant analysis, considering the area under the curve (AUC), provided a reliable measure of the model's ability to differentiate between individuals with and without sexually transmitted infections (sGTIs). Additionally, we generated bootstrapped bias-corrected 95% confidence intervals for the AUC as a sensitivity analysis, further validating the model's performance.\n\nThe calibration belt plot was also adopted to assess the agreement between the model-predicted probabilities and the actual observed rates of sGTIs. This plot examines the variation between expected and observed probabilities, ensuring that the model does not misclassify individuals. The calibration belt plot analysis showed that the predicted probabilities were statistically not different from the observed rates, indicating that the model performed well without misclassifying individuals.\n\nIn summary, we used LASSO regression to handle potential overfitting by shrinking less important coefficients to zero, and tenfold cross-validation to ensure the model's generalizability and to avoid underfitting. The calibration belt plot further validated the model's accuracy in predicting sGTIs.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) penalized regression to prevent overfitting. This method is an extension of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression that adds a penalty to the OLS residual sum of squares. By introducing this penalty, LASSO effectively shrinks the coefficients of less dominant variables towards zero, thereby excluding them from the model. This process helps in selecting a subset of predictors and simplifies the model, which is particularly useful when dealing with high levels of multicollinearity. The LASSO regression was further enhanced using tenfold cross-validation to determine the optimal amount of coefficient shrinkage. This cross-validation process involved dividing the data into multiple folds, using one fold as a validation set while training the model on the remaining folds. This approach was repeated multiple times, and the results were averaged to produce a more robust effect size estimate of the model. By implementing LASSO regression with cross-validation, we ensured that our model was both accurate and generalizable, reducing the risk of overfitting and enhancing its predictive performance.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization schedule used in our study are detailed within the publication. Specifically, the LASSO regression model was employed, which fits 76 models using different values of lambda. The best model, identified as model 76, had the smallest cross-validation mean prediction error with a mean deviance of 0.6524. The overall mean lambda was approximately 0.01. These details are presented in Table 4 of the supplementary material.\n\nThe model files and optimization parameters are not explicitly provided in the publication. However, the methodology and results are thoroughly described, allowing for replication of the study's findings. The conceptual framework and the variables considered in the model-building process are depicted in Supplementary Figure 2. The best-fitted model was selected following the assessment of the AUC, AIC, and BIC, with the smallest values indicating the best fit.\n\nThe data used in this study were obtained from the DHS Monitoring and Evaluation to Assess and Use Results of Demographic and Health Surveys (MEASURE DHS) Department. Permission to use the secondary data can be requested from the DHS. The specific request can be obtained from the DHS website.\n\nThe ethical requirements and data access information are provided, ensuring transparency and reproducibility. The analyses were conducted using Stata 17, and the detailed steps and considerations are outlined in the methodology section. This information should facilitate the replication of the study and the application of the predictive model in similar contexts.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a black-box model. It is based on a LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) penalized regression, which is inherently interpretable. LASSO regression is an extension of ordinary least squares regression that adds a penalty to the residual sum of squares, effectively shrinking some coefficients to zero. This process selects a subset of predictors by excluding those with the least impact, thereby simplifying the model and making it more interpretable.\n\nThe best predictive model from the LASSO regression retained all variables as predictors, indicating that each variable contributes to the prediction of self-reported sexually transmitted genital tract infections (sGTIs). The model equation, which is presented in the supplementary material, provides a clear relationship between the predictors and the outcome. This equation can be used to understand how changes in each predictor variable affect the predicted probability of sGTIs.\n\nFor example, the probability of an individual self-reporting sGTIs is given by the logistic regression equation:\n\nprobability = e^(\u03b20 + \u03b21*x1 + \u03b22*x2 + \u2026 + \u03b2k*xk) / (1 + e^(\u03b20 + \u03b21*x1 + \u03b22*x2 + \u2026 + \u03b2k*xk))\n\nwhere \u03b2 represents the coefficient estimates for all the parameters from the LASSO penalty regression analysis. Each \u03b2 coefficient indicates the strength and direction of the relationship between a predictor variable (x) and the outcome. Positive coefficients increase the probability of sGTIs, while negative coefficients decrease it.\n\nThe model includes various socio-demographic characteristics such as wealth quintile, number of household members, region, place of residence, sanitation, sex, age group, educational level, sexual initiation, currently working, and staying with partner. These variables were selected based on a priori review of the literature and their known associations with STIs. The inclusion of these variables in the final model allows for a transparent understanding of the factors influencing sGTIs.\n\nAdditionally, the calibration belt plot analysis showed that the predicted probabilities of sGTIs from the LASSO penalty regression model are statistically not different from the observed sGTIs rates across all probabilities. This indicates that the model performs well in predicting the actual rates of sGTIs, further enhancing its interpretability and reliability.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a classification model. It is designed to predict the likelihood of an individual self-reporting sexually transmitted genital tract infections (sGTIs) at the community level in Ghana. The model uses a LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) penalized regression approach, which is a type of logistic regression. Logistic regression is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. The outcome is measured with a dichotomous variable (in this case, the presence or absence of sGTIs). The model's performance was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which is a common metric for assessing the performance of classification models. The AUC values for the models ranged from approximately 70.79% to 73.50%, indicating the model's ability to discriminate between individuals with and without sGTIs. Additionally, the calibration belt plot analysis showed that the predicted probabilities of sGTIs were not statistically different from the observed rates, further supporting the model's classification capabilities. The best-fitted model, Model 3, demonstrated the highest ability to accurately classify individuals with and without sGTIs, as evidenced by its smallest AIC and BIC values.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the method involved several rigorous statistical techniques to ensure the robustness and reliability of the model. The primary evaluation metric used was the area under the curve (AUC) from the cross-validation discriminant analysis. This metric assesses the model's ability to differentiate between individuals with and without self-reported genital tract infections (sGTIs). The AUC values were derived from a tenfold cross-validation process, which divides the data into multiple folds, using one fold for validation and the remaining folds for training. This process is repeated multiple times, and the results are averaged to produce a more robust estimate of the model's performance.\n\nAdditionally, the calibration belt plot was employed to assess the agreement between the model-predicted probabilities and the actual observed rates of sGTIs. This plot examines the variation between expected and observed probabilities, ensuring that the model does not misclassify individuals. The calibration belt plot showed that the predicted probabilities were statistically not different from the observed rates, indicating good model calibration.\n\nThe best-fitted model was selected based on the smallest Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) values. These criteria are used to compare the quality of statistical models for a given set of data, with smaller values indicating a better fit. Model 3 was identified as the best-fitted model, demonstrating the highest ability to accurately classify individuals with and without sGTIs at the community level.\n\nA sensitivity analysis was also conducted to examine the potential influence of the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (GDHS) stratification on the discriminant and calibration belt plot analyses. This involved utilizing bootstrapping resampling methods with 1000 replicates for the optimal model. The results from the sensitivity analysis were statistically not different from the main model results, further supporting the model's reliability.\n\nOverall, the evaluation methods ensured that the model was thoroughly tested and validated, providing a reliable tool for predicting sGTIs at the community level.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed several performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of our predictive models for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) at the community level in Ghana. The primary metric used was the Area Under the Curve (AUC) from the cross-validation discriminant analysis. The AUC provides a measure of the model's ability to differentiate between individuals with and without STIs, with higher values indicating better performance. We reported the AUC for three models, with Model 3 achieving the highest AUC of approximately 73.50%, suggesting it has the best discriminative ability.\n\nAdditionally, we used the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to assess model fit. These criteria penalize models for the number of parameters they include, helping to prevent overfitting. Model 3 had the smallest AIC and BIC values, further supporting its selection as the best-fitted model.\n\nTo ensure the robustness of our findings, we conducted a sensitivity analysis using bootstrapped bias-corrected 95% confidence intervals for the AUC. This method involved resampling the data with replacement to generate multiple datasets and calculating the AUC for each. The results from the sensitivity analysis were statistically similar to the main model results, indicating that our model's performance is reliable.\n\nWe also utilized calibration belt plots to assess the agreement between the model-predicted probabilities and the actual observed rates of STIs. The calibration belt plots examine the variation between expected and observed probabilities at certain confidence levels, providing a visual representation of the model's calibration. Our models performed well in this regard, with the predicted probabilities not significantly differing from the observed rates.\n\nThe set of metrics we used is representative of standard practices in the literature for evaluating predictive models, particularly in the context of epidemiological studies. The AUC is a widely accepted measure of model performance, while AIC and BIC are commonly used for model selection. The use of bootstrapping and calibration plots further enhances the rigor of our evaluation, ensuring that our model is both accurate and generalizable.",

This plot examines the variation between expected and observed probabilities, providing insights into the model's calibration.\n\nIn terms of comparison to simpler baselines, we did not explicitly compare our LASSO model to simpler statistical methods such as logistic regression without penalization. However, the use of LASSO regression is justified by its ability to handle multicollinearity and perform variable selection, which are crucial for improving the predictive performance and interpretability of the model.\n\nFor the comparison to publicly available methods on benchmark datasets, we did not perform such comparisons. Our focus was on developing a robust predictive model using the LASSO regression approach tailored to the specific dataset and context of the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (GDHS). The model's performance was evaluated internally using cross-validation and sensitivity analyses, ensuring its reliability and generalizability within the studied population.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the models included several performance metrics with confidence intervals to assess their reliability. The area under the curve (AUC) from the cross-validation discriminant analysis was reported with 95% confidence intervals, which were bootstrapped bias-corrected.

Model 3, which had the smallest AIC and BIC values, was identified as the best-fitted model.

This suggests that the model performs well without misclassifying individuals.\n\nOverall, the performance metrics, confidence intervals, and statistical significance of the results provide a strong basis for claiming that the method is superior to others and baselines.",
