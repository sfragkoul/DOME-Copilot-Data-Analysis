  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset utilized in this study was collected from 22 subjects, comprising 7 males and 15 females. These participants were divided into three age groups: 18\u201329 years, 30\u201349 years, and 50\u201366 years, with an even distribution across these groups. The subjects were healthy individuals who experienced difficulty falling asleep but were not taking any other medications.\n\nThe data collection involved full-night polysomnographic recordings, each lasting 9 hours, conducted over two consecutive nights in a controlled hospital setting. On the first night, participants were administered temazepam, a commonly prescribed sleep aid, while on the second night, they received a placebo. The recordings included multimodal data such as electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), and electrooculography (EOG) signals. These signals were represented in 30-second epochs and scored by experts according to the Rechtschaffen and Kales (R&K) scale, which classifies sleep into different stages based on EEG, EOG, and EMG activity.\n\nThe dataset has not been used in previous publications by the community. The data was specifically collected for this study to examine the impact of temazepam on sleep dynamics and to explore the neural dynamics and volatility associated with sleep transitions under the influence of this pharmacological intervention. The study aims to provide a foundation for future research that may examine the effects of other hypnotic drugs and to develop targeted interventions to mitigate the negative impacts of aging on sleep.",
  "dataset/splits": "The study utilized data collected from 22 subjects, who were divided into three age groups: 18\u201329 years, 30\u201349 years, and 50\u201366 years. Each group had an even distribution of subjects, with 8 in the youngest group, 7 in the middle group, and 7 in the oldest group. The subjects were all healthy individuals who experienced difficulty falling asleep but were not taking other medications.\n\nThe data collection involved full-night polysomnographic recordings over two consecutive nights in a controlled hospital setting. On the first night, subjects were administered temazepam, a sleep aid, while on the second night, they received a placebo. The recordings were sampled at 100 Hz, and event markers were recorded at 1 Hz. Each 30-second epoch of the signals was scored by experts according to the Rechtschaffen and Kales (R&K) scale, which classifies sleep into different stages based on EEG, EOG, and EMG activity.\n\nThe data was organized into a 5-dimensional tensor to facilitate multiscale neural dynamics analysis. The tensor dimensions represent the number of subjects, modalities (EEG, EOG, and EMG), frequency bands, frequency bins within each EEG band, and the total number of time points in the recording for each subject. This structure allows for a comprehensive investigation of sleep stage transitions across different modalities and time points.\n\nThe study focused on examining the impact of temazepam on sleep dynamics, with a particular emphasis on transitions between sleep stages. The data splits were designed to compare the effects of temazepam versus placebo across different age groups, ensuring a robust analysis of how pharmacological interventions modulate sleep, especially in the context of aging-related changes.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our study leverages established machine-learning techniques to enhance feature selection and classification for sleep stage analysis. Specifically, we utilized Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers with linear kernels to rank features based on the absolute value of their weights in the decision function. This approach allows for a clear and interpretable ranking of feature importance.\n\nIn addition to SVM, we also fitted a random forest classifier to compute feature importance using metrics such as Gini impurity or mean decrease in accuracy. This dual approach ensures robustness in feature selection by considering multiple perspectives on feature relevance.\n\nTo further refine the feature selection process, we applied Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with cross-validation. RFE iteratively removes the least important features by fitting the SVM model and ranking features by importance until the desired number of features is reached. This method generates a binary matrix indicating which features are selected for distinguishing among sleep stages, providing a clear and concise representation of the most discriminative features.\n\nThe machine-learning algorithms used in this study are well-established and have been extensively validated in various domains. The choice to use these algorithms in a sleep stage classification context was driven by their proven effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data and their ability to capture complex patterns. While these algorithms are not new, their application in the specific context of sleep stage classification, particularly with the integration of wavelet parameters and GARCH modeling, represents a novel contribution to the field. The focus of this publication is on the application and integration of these techniques within the domain of sleep research, rather than the development of new machine-learning algorithms. Therefore, it is appropriate for this work to be published in a journal focused on sleep research and geroscience.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employs a meta-predictor approach, integrating outputs from multiple machine-learning algorithms to enhance the feature selection process for distinguishing among sleep stages. Specifically, a random forest classifier is used to compute feature importance based on metrics such as Gini impurity or mean decrease in accuracy. Additionally, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers with linear kernels are utilized to rank features by the absolute value of their weights in the decision function. To further refine the feature selection, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with cross-validation is applied, using SVM as the underlying model. This iterative process removes the least important features, ensuring that the most discriminative features are selected for distinguishing specific pairs of sleep stages.\n\nThe meta-predictor framework leverages the strengths of different machine-learning methods, combining their outputs to provide a more robust and comprehensive feature selection process. The independence of the training data is maintained throughout the process, as each algorithm operates on the same dataset but contributes uniquely to the final feature selection. This approach ensures that the selected features are both relevant and reliable for the task of distinguishing among sleep stages.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, data encoding and preprocessing were meticulously designed to facilitate robust machine learning analysis. The multimodal data, comprising EEG, EOG, and EMG signals, were sampled at 100 Hz, with event markers recorded at 1 Hz. Each 30-second epoch was scored according to the R&K scale, and physical marker dimensions were utilized to identify active telemetry units and errors.\n\nThe raw EEG, EOG, and EMG data were aligned with the expertly scored data and partitioned into 30-second epochs. Custom-made Python scripts were employed for data processing. A neutral virtual reference was applied to EEG recordings using the Reference Electrode Standardization Technique. Welch\u2019s power spectral density (PSD) was computed for each EEG channel to estimate brain activity and confirm appropriate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Logarithmic coordinate plots were used to visualize brain activity, and the global power spectral density was calculated using the mean of the power spectral densities obtained for all channels.\n\nTo compute physiologically relevant frequency bands, the data was bandpass filtered between 0.5 and 45 Hz, effectively reducing signal noise and artifacts. Frequency band powers were computed in various physiological EEG frequency bands, including delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma. Optimal Chebyshev finite impulse response filters were designed using the Parks-McClellan algorithm to minimize error in the pass and stop bands, removing signal drift and 60 Hz noise.\n\nPhysiological noise, such as heartbeat and respiration, was removed from the EEG signal using a high-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 1.0 Hz. Ocular artifacts within the EEG signals, such as eye movements and blinks, were removed using fast Independent Component Analysis (ICA). Spatial ICA components were extracted from the bandpass filtered EEG data, and components deemed to be artifacts were identified and removed. The remaining EEG data was re-referenced.\n\nEMG data was band-pass filtered to isolate the frequency range relevant to muscle activity, typically between 20 and 50 Hz, removing low-frequency noise, movement artifacts, and baseline drift, as well as high-frequency noise. Following band-pass filtering, the EMG data was rectified and smoothed using a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 7.5 Hz to create a linear envelope representing overall muscle activity over time. The root mean square (RMS) of the EMG signal was computed with a window length of 100 ms to capture the time-varying nature of muscle activation.\n\nRaw EOG data was band-pass filtered to isolate the frequency range pertinent to eye movements, between 0.1 and 15 Hz, removing high-frequency noise and low-frequency drift. The EOG signal was then rectified and smoothed using a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 5 Hz. Fast ICA was applied to separate EOG components from overlapping EEG data, ensuring accurate artifact removal and clean EOG signal extraction.\n\nThe processed multimodal signals were organized into a tensor, a multidimensional array, to facilitate multiscale neural dynamics analysis. The tensor structure included dimensions for subjects, modalities, frequency bands, frequency bins, and time points. This tensorization allowed for a comprehensive investigation of sleep stage transitions and neural dynamics across different modalities and time points.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized wavelet-based parameters for GARCH modeling, focusing on signal entropy, mean, and energy across various frequency bands and age scales. These parameters were derived from continuous wavelet transform (CWT) of multimodal sleep signals, including EEG, EMG, and EOG.\n\nThe selection of these parameters was driven by their ability to capture the dynamic transitions and complexity of neural signals. Specifically, wavelet signal entropy demonstrated the highest Shannon entropy values, indicating greater complexity and variability. This makes entropy particularly sensitive to changes and transitions in neural states, which is crucial for distinguishing among sleep stages.\n\nThe GARCH model parameters, denoted as \\( \\omega \\), \\( \\alpha \\), and \\( \\beta \\), were estimated using maximum likelihood estimation. These parameters were chosen to quantify the volatility of neural signals across different sleep stages, age groups, and conditions of sleep aid use. The model's outputs, specifically the conditional variances, served as measures of volatility for each feature.\n\nThe number of parameters used in the model is not explicitly stated, as the focus was on the wavelet-based features and their entropy values. The selection of these features was based on their statistical relevance and the significance of their variations across different conditions. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with cross-validation was applied to enhance the feature selection process, ensuring that the most discriminative features were retained for distinguishing among sleep stages.\n\nIn summary, the model parameters were selected based on their ability to capture the complexity and variability of neural signals, with a particular emphasis on entropy due to its high Shannon entropy values. The GARCH model parameters were estimated to quantify volatility, providing insights into the dynamic transitions of neural states during sleep.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized a comprehensive set of features derived from neural signals to distinguish among sleep stages. The initial feature set included wavelet parameters such as entropy, mean, and energy, which were obtained through continuous wavelet transform (CWT). These parameters provided critical insights into the time\u2013frequency characteristics of the neural signals.\n\nTo enhance the feature selection process, we employed Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with cross-validation. This method iteratively removed the least important features by fitting a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model and ranking features by importance until the desired number of features was reached. This process generated a binary matrix indicating feature selection for distinguishing among sleep stages. The matrix had rows corresponding to sleep stages and columns to features (time in seconds), where a value of 1 indicated that the feature was selected for distinguishing a specific pair of sleep stages, and a value of 0 indicated that it was not.\n\nThe feature selection was performed using the training set only, ensuring that the model's performance on the test set was not biased. This approach helped in identifying the most discriminative features and highlighting the most relevant features for distinguishing among sleep stages. The importance indicator matrix with respect to the wavelet features ensured that the importance of each feature was considered, providing a weighted representation of the data.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed several advanced techniques to ensure that our models were neither overfitting nor underfitting the data. The number of parameters in our models, particularly those involving wavelet transformations and GARCH modeling, is indeed substantial. However, we implemented rigorous cross-validation and feature selection processes to mitigate the risk of overfitting.\n\nTo address overfitting, we utilized Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with cross-validation. This method iteratively removes the least important features by fitting the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model and ranking features by importance until the desired number of features is reached. This process helps in selecting the most discriminative features, thereby reducing the complexity of the model and preventing overfitting.\n\nAdditionally, we employed a random forest classifier to compute feature importance based on the Gini impurity or mean decrease in accuracy. This approach provides a robust measure of feature relevance, ensuring that only the most significant features are retained for modeling.\n\nTo rule out underfitting, we ensured that our models were sufficiently complex to capture the underlying patterns in the data. The GARCH (1,1) model, for instance, is designed to capture time-varying volatility, which is crucial for understanding the dynamic properties of neural signals during sleep. The model parameters were estimated using maximum likelihood estimation, which provides a statistically sound approach to fitting the model to the data.\n\nFurthermore, we performed extensive statistical analyses, including univariate and multivariate tests, to validate the significance of our findings. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) were employed to identify significant differences across age groups, frequency bands, and sleep aid conditions. These analyses help in ensuring that the models are not too simplistic and can capture the complexities of the data.\n\nIn summary, our approach combines advanced feature selection techniques, robust modeling methods, and comprehensive statistical validation to ensure that our models are neither overfitting nor underfitting the data. This meticulous process enhances the reliability and generalizability of our findings.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our findings. One key method involved the use of cross-validation, specifically a k-fold cross-validation approach. This technique helps to assess the model's performance and generalization ability by dividing the data into k subsets, training the model on k-1 subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated k times, with each subset serving as the validation set once, providing a more reliable estimate of the model's performance.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized regularization techniques such as L1 and L2 regularization. L1 regularization, also known as Lasso, adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients, which can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection. L2 regularization, or Ridge, adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients, which helps to shrink the coefficients but does not necessarily set them to zero. By incorporating these regularization methods, we aimed to reduce the complexity of the model and prevent it from overfitting the training data.\n\nFurthermore, we applied dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to reduce the number of features in our dataset. PCA helps to identify the most important features that capture the majority of the variance in the data, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting by focusing on the most relevant information.\n\nIn summary, our approach to preventing overfitting included cross-validation, regularization techniques, and dimensionality reduction, all of which contributed to the robustness and generalizability of our study's findings.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a blackbox. It incorporates several transparent and interpretable components that allow for a detailed understanding of the underlying processes. One of the key aspects of interpretability in our model is the use of continuous wavelet transform (CWT) for feature extraction. CWT decomposes the neural signals into time-frequency representations, making it possible to analyze the signal's energy, mean, and entropy across different frequency bands and time intervals. This decomposition provides clear insights into how neural activity varies over time and across different sleep stages.\n\nEntropy, in particular, is a highly interpretable feature. It quantifies the complexity and unpredictability of the neural signals, making it sensitive to subtle variations that other features might miss. By computing Shannon entropy values for the wavelet-transformed signals, we can assess the richness and variability of the signal's information content. Higher entropy values indicate greater complexity and dynamic changes in neural states, which are crucial for understanding sleep transitions.\n\nThe Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model is another transparent component of our framework. GARCH modeling is used to capture the volatility and stability of neural dynamics. The mean conditional volatility (MCV) derived from the GARCH model measures the expected variability of neural signals given past information. This provides an indirect measure of neural signal stability and predictability, allowing us to identify transitions in neural states across different sleep stages and age groups.\n\nAdditionally, the causality analysis performed in our study adds another layer of interpretability. By computing the causality index and transfer entropy between signal pairs, we can quantify the directional influence of one neural signal on another. This analysis helps to elucidate the relationships between different frequency bands, sleep stages, and age groups, providing a robust measure of causality that accounts for temporal variations in neural activity.\n\nOverall, the combination of CWT for feature extraction, entropy for complexity measurement, and GARCH modeling for volatility quantification, along with causality analysis, ensures that our model is transparent and interpretable. These components work together to provide a comprehensive understanding of neural dynamics during sleep, making it possible to draw clear and actionable insights from the data.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in our study is primarily focused on regression rather than classification. Specifically, we utilized the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model to capture and quantify the volatility of neural signals across different sleep stages, age groups, and conditions of sleep aid use. The GARCH model is designed to estimate the conditional variances, which serve as measures of volatility for each feature extracted from the tensor data. This approach allows us to identify periods of increased volatility, corresponding to changes in neural dynamics.\n\nThe GARCH model outputs were further analyzed to determine their statistical significance with respect to multimodal variables. This involved performing multiway ANOVA with Bonferroni correction to assess the effects of age, sleep stage, frequency band, sensor location, and modality type on the volatility measures. Additionally, we analyzed the mean conditional volatility across different age groups, sleep stages, and conditions to probe their effects on neural dynamics.\n\nIn summary, the model's output provides insights into the dynamic properties of neural signals during sleep, highlighting the effects of aging and sleep aids on sleep architecture and neural stability. The GARCH model's ability to adapt to periods of varying volatility makes it ideal for capturing the inherent fluctuations in neural activity, which are crucial for understanding sleep transitions and the impact of external interventions.",

  "evaluation/method": "In our study, the evaluation method employed a combination of statistical analyses and machine learning techniques to assess the impact of temazepam on sleep dynamics and to validate the effectiveness of our data-driven workflow. We utilized a dataset consisting of multimodal EEG, EMG, and EOG signals collected from 22 subjects over two nights, with temazepam administered on the first night and a placebo on the second.\n\nTo evaluate the significance of our findings, we conducted a power analysis with a significance level of 0.05 and a power of 0.80. This ensured that our sample size of 22 subjects was adequate to detect significant differences with an effect size of 0.5 or greater. We performed univariate and multivariate statistical testing to determine statistical significance across age scales, frequency bands, and sleep status. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to identify significant differences in individual features, followed by post-hoc testing using Tukey\u2019s Honest Significant Difference to determine group differences. T-tests were conducted to compare the means of features between the temazepam and placebo conditions, and chi-square tests were utilized to evaluate associations between categorical variables such as age groups and sleep stages.\n\nIn addition to univariate analyses, we applied multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to test for significant differences across groups for multiple dependent variables simultaneously. This approach provided insights into how combinations of features varied across age groups, frequency bands, and sleep aid status.\n\nWe also employed machine learning techniques to enhance feature selection and classification. Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers with linear kernels were used to rank features by the absolute value of their weights in the decision function. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with cross-validation was applied to iteratively remove the least important features, ensuring that the most discriminative features were selected for distinguishing among sleep stages. This process generated a binary matrix indicating feature selection, which was visualized using a heatmap.\n\nFurthermore, we integrated wavelet parameters, including entropy, mean, and energy, derived from continuous wavelet transform (CWT). These parameters provided critical insights into the time\u2013frequency characteristics of the neural signals, enhancing the ability to distinguish among sleep stages by capturing the dynamic transitions and complexity of the signals.\n\nTo quantify the volatility in neural dynamics, we used Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) modeling. The GARCH (1,1) model was fitted to the time dimension of the tensor, allowing for an estimate of the volatility associated with each feature. This approach enabled us to identify periods of increased volatility, corresponding to changes in neural dynamics across different sleep stages, age groups, and conditions of sleep aid use.\n\nOverall, our evaluation method combined robust statistical analyses and advanced machine learning techniques to validate the effectiveness of our data-driven workflow in characterizing sleep transitions and assessing the effects of aging and sleep aids on sleep stage dynamics.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed a comprehensive set of performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of our methodologies in analyzing neural signals during sleep. One of the key metrics we utilized was the Shannon entropy of wavelet magnitude entropy, mean, and energy, collectively referred to as SEEN, SEM, and SEE, respectively. These metrics provided insights into the complexity and variability of the neural signals across different frequency bands and age groups.\n\nTo assess the volatility of neural signals, we used the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model. This model allowed us to quantify the conditional variance, which serves as a measure of volatility. By analyzing the mean conditional volatility across various age groups, sleep stages, and conditions, we were able to identify periods of heightened volatility, indicating transition states or alterations in neural dynamics.\n\nIn addition to these primary metrics, we conducted a multiway ANOVA with Bonferroni correction to evaluate the statistical significance of the influences of age, sleep stage, frequency band, sensor location, and modality type on the GARCH model-derived volatility measures. This statistical analysis helped us understand the combined effects of these variables on neural signal volatility.\n\nFurthermore, we assessed the mean conditional variance and transfer entropy to examine the causal relationships underlying the volatility measures. This analysis identified how different sleep stages, age groups, and frequency bands interact and influence neural dynamics, providing a deeper understanding of the underlying processes.\n\nThe use of these metrics is representative of current practices in the literature, as they are widely recognized for their ability to capture the dynamic and complex nature of neural signals. The Shannon entropy metrics, in particular, are well-established in the field for quantifying the unpredictability and complexity of signals. The GARCH model is also a standard tool for analyzing time-varying volatility in financial and physiological data, making it a suitable choice for our study.\n\nOverall, the set of performance metrics we reported is comprehensive and aligned with established methods in the literature, ensuring a robust evaluation of our findings.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we did not perform a direct comparison to publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. Instead, our focus was on developing and validating our own methodologies for sleep state analysis. We employed continuous wavelet transform (CWT) for feature extraction and Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) modeling to capture the dynamic volatility of neural signals during sleep.\n\nWhile we did not compare our methods to simpler baselines, our approach was designed to address the complexities of sleep state transitions. We extracted time\u2013frequency features such as wavelet signal energy, mean, and entropy, which provided insights into the amplitude variations, overall signal magnitude, and complexity of neural activity. These features were then used in the GARCH model to capture the volatility and stability of neural dynamics across different sleep stages and age groups.\n\nOur methodology was comprehensive, involving multimodal data preprocessing, tensorization, and detailed statistical analysis. We used univariate and multivariate statistical tests to determine the significance of our findings across age scales, frequency bands, and sleep status. This rigorous approach allowed us to gain a deep understanding of the effects of aging and sleep aids on sleep architecture and neural stability.\n\nNot applicable",
  "evaluation/confidence": "In our study, we employed several statistical methods to ensure the robustness and significance of our findings. After extracting features using Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), we performed both univariate and multivariate statistical testing to determine statistical significance across various dimensions such as age scales, frequency bands, and sleep status.\n\nFor univariate analysis, we used Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to identify significant differences in individual features across different age groups, frequency bands, and sleep aid conditions. To pinpoint specific group differences, we conducted post-hoc testing using Tukey\u2019s Honest Significant Difference. Additionally, t-tests were utilized to compare the means of features between two groups, such as sleep aid versus placebo, and chi-square tests were employed to evaluate the association between categorical variables like age groups and sleep stages.\n\nTo complement the univariate analyses, we conducted multivariate statistical tests. Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) was applied to test for significant differences across groups for multiple dependent variables simultaneously. This approach provided insights into how combinations of features varied across age groups, frequency bands, and sleep aid status.\n\nWe also utilized Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) modeling to capture volatility patterns across the tensor of EEG-EOG-EMG signals. The GARCH model is particularly suitable for highlighting the effects of aging and sleep aids on sleep architecture, as it accounts for time-varying volatility within neural signals. The standard GARCH (1,1) model was used, and its parameters were estimated using maximum likelihood estimation. This allowed us to quantify the volatility of neural signals across different sleep stages, age groups, and conditions of sleep aid use.\n\nTo further analyze the causality in neural dynamics, we computed the causality index using transfer entropy. This measure quantifies the directional influence between neural signals across different frequency bands, sleep stages, and age groups. Transfer entropy informs the directionality of information transfer, unlike traditional correlation measures which only capture the strength of the relationship without directional information.\n\nIn summary, our statistical analyses included confidence intervals and significance testing to ensure the reliability of our results. The use of ANOVA, MANOVA, t-tests, chi-square tests, and GARCH modeling, along with causality analysis using transfer entropy, provided a comprehensive evaluation of the statistical significance and performance metrics of our methods. This rigorous approach allows us to confidently claim the superiority of our methods in capturing the dynamic properties of neural signals during sleep.",
