  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study consists of four cohorts: GSE24080, UAMS, HOVON65, and MMRF. The number of patients in each cohort varies, with GSE24080 having 559 patients, UAMS having 282 patients, HOVON65 having 636 patients, and MMRF having 147 patients. The gene expression data for the MMRF cohort were generated from RNA sequencing, while the other three cohorts used microarray as the original method. The number of gene expression features also differs among the cohorts, with 18,994 features for EMTAB4032, 20,514 features for GSE24080 and HOVON65, and 24,128 features for MMRF. All genes were used as features, and the expression data were pre-processed by the challenge organizers and data providers to ensure consistency. Additionally, age and International Staging System (ISS) stages were available as clinical and demographic data. The ISS is a risk-staging system based on the assessment of two blood tests: \u03b22 microglobulin and albumin. The demographic characteristics of each cohort are summarized in a table. This dataset has been used in previous studies and challenges, such as the 2017 Multiple Myeloma DREAM Challenge, which provided the original survival data and contributed to the development of the prediction models presented in this study.",
  "dataset/splits": "In our study, we employed a model validation scheme that included both within-cohort and across-cohort validation. For within-cohort validation, we utilized a 5-fold cross-validation approach, which means the data were split into 5 different subsets. Each subset was used once as a validation set while the remaining four subsets were used for training. This process was repeated 5 times, ensuring that each subset served as the validation set exactly once. This method helps in assessing the model's performance and generalization within the same cohort.\n\nThe distribution of data points in each split is determined by the number of patients in each cohort. Specifically, the cohorts GSE24080UAMS, HOVON65, EMTAB4032, and MMRF have 559, 282, 147, and 636 patients, respectively. During the 5-fold cross-validation, each cohort's data is divided into 5 approximately equal parts. For example, in the GSE24080UAMS cohort, each fold would contain roughly 112 patients, ensuring a balanced distribution across the training and validation sets.\n\nFor across-cohort validation, the data from different cohorts are used to train and validate the model, leveraging the diversity in the datasets to enhance the model's robustness and generalizability. This approach helps in evaluating how well the model performs when applied to new, unseen data from different sources.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "In our study, we employed a robust model validation scheme that included both within-cohort and across-cohort validation to ensure the reliability and generalizability of our prognostic model for multiple myeloma progression. For within-cohort validation, we utilized a 5-fold cross-validation approach, where the data from each cohort was split into five subsets. This process was repeated five times, ensuring that each subset served as the test set once while the remaining subsets were used for training. This method helped in assessing the model's performance within the same cohort and mitigating overfitting.\n\nTo further validate the model's robustness and generalizability, we conducted across-cohort validation. In this approach, the model was trained on one cohort and then tested on a different, independent cohort. This cross-cohort evaluation was performed for all possible pairs of the four cohorts, resulting in 12 training-test pairs. The performance was evaluated using metrics such as integrated AUC and C-index, demonstrating the model's ability to generalize across different datasets.\n\nThe datasets used in this study were provided by the Multiple Myeloma DREAM Challenge and included four cohorts: GSE24080UAMS, HOVON65, EMTAB4032, and MMRF. These cohorts were independent of each other, ensuring that the training and test sets were distinct. The data preprocessing steps, including imputation of missing values and quantile normalization, were applied consistently across all cohorts to eliminate batch effects and ensure data consistency.\n\nThe distribution of the datasets in terms of the number of patients, gene expression features, and clinical characteristics varied across the cohorts. For instance, the MMRF cohort had the largest number of patients and gene expression features, while the EMTAB4032 cohort had the smallest. The demographic characteristics, such as age, sex ratio, and International Staging System (ISS) stages, also differed among the cohorts. This variability in the datasets helped in evaluating the model's performance across diverse patient populations and ensured that the results were not biased by any single cohort.\n\nIn summary, the datasets were split using a 5-fold cross-validation approach for within-cohort validation and a cross-cohort validation scheme for assessing generalizability. The training and test sets were independent, and the distribution of the datasets compared favorably with previously published machine learning datasets in terms of diversity and size.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data used in this study were provided by the Multiple Myeloma DREAM Challenge. The cohorts included in the study are GSE24080UAMS, HOVON65, EMTAB4032, and MMRF. These datasets are publicly available and were pre-processed by the challenge organizers and data providers to ensure consistency. The gene expression data for the MMRF cohort were generated from RNA sequencing, while the other three cohorts used microarray as the original method. The number of gene expression features varies across the cohorts, with 18,994 for EMTAB4032, 20,514 for GSE24080UAMS, 20,514 for HOVON65, and 24,128 for MMRF. All genes were used as features in the analysis. Clinical and demographic data, including age and International Staging System (ISS) stages, are also available for all cohorts. The demographic characteristics of each cohort are summarized in a table within the publication. The data splits used for validation, including within-cohort and across-cohort validation, were part of the challenge's design to ensure robust model evaluation. The specific splits and preprocessing steps, such as imputation of missing values and quantile normalization, are detailed in the methods section. The dockerized environment has been registered in bio.tools with the identifier biotools: Multiple Myeloma survival prediction, and in SciCrunch with the identifier RRID:SCR 017651.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in our study is Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). This is a type of Bayesian non-parametric method that can model complex systems while handling uncertainty in a principled manner. We also utilized random forests as part of our modeling approach.\n\nThe algorithm employed is not entirely new, but its application in this context is innovative. Specifically, we developed a complete hazard-ranking framework called GuanRank to estimate the relative rankings of censored patients. This framework transforms the censored data problem into a standard regression problem, allowing for a wider spectrum of base learners and making it more likely to find the most suitable one. By integrating GuanRank with GPR, we were able to significantly boost performance, particularly in multi-cohort and cross-cohort modeling.\n\nThe reason this work was published in a biomedical journal rather than a machine-learning journal is that the primary focus of our study is on the application of these machine-learning techniques to improve the prognosis of multiple myeloma (MM) progression. The innovation lies in the integration of gene expression profiles and clinical features to predict MM progression, which is a significant contribution to the field of biomedical research. The technical details of the machine-learning algorithms are secondary to the biomedical application and the improvements in prognostic accuracy that they enable.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employed in this study can be considered a meta-predictor, as it integrates predictions from multiple sources to enhance overall performance. Specifically, it combines gene expression data and clinical features to improve the prediction of multiple myeloma progression.\n\nThe meta-predictor utilizes two types of models: one based on gene expression data and another based on clinical data. These models are built separately and their predictions are then stacked together. The clinical features considered include age and the International Staging System (ISS) stages. For these clinical features, a separate linear regression model is built to predict outcomes, and these predictions are combined with those from the gene expression-based model.\n\nThe stacking process involves giving equal weight to both the gene expression and clinical data models, with 50% contribution from each, as this proportion yielded the best performance. This approach leverages the strengths of both data types, capturing different aspects of information relevant to multiple myeloma progression.\n\nRegarding the independence of training data, it is implied that the data used for training the individual models (gene expression and clinical data models) are independent. However, the specific details of how the data was split and ensured to be independent are not explicitly stated. The model's robustness is further validated through cross-cohort predictions, where the model is trained on one cohort and tested on another, demonstrating its ability to generalize across different datasets.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the machine-learning algorithm, the data underwent several preprocessing steps to ensure consistency and compatibility. The gene expression data were generated using different methods across cohorts: RNA sequencing for the MMRF cohort and microarray for the other three cohorts. The number of gene expression features varied across cohorts, with 18,994 features for EMTAB4032, 20,514 for GSE24080UAMS and HOVON65, and 24,128 for MMRF. All genes were used as features, and the expression data were pre-processed by the challenge organizers and data providers to ensure consistency.\n\nTo handle missing values, we imputed them using the mean value across patients. Quantile normalization was applied to the expression data to force the values into the same distribution, eliminating batch effects. This step was crucial for integrating data from different sources and ensuring that the machine-learning models could effectively learn from the combined dataset.\n\nFor the time-to-event data, we transformed the original labels, which consisted of a binary status and corresponding event/censoring time, into a single regressible label. This transformation was necessary because typical machine-learning models cannot directly use the event/censoring time. We employed a complete hazard-ranking algorithm called GuanRank to rank all patients and assign a score based on their relative hazards using a Kaplan-Meier function. This process involved pairwise comparisons of patients, considering various scenarios of event times and censoring statuses. The resulting rank scores were normalized into the range 0\u20131, providing a target for different machine-learning algorithms, such as Gaussian process regression (GPR) and random forest.\n\nClinical and demographic data, including age and International Staging System (ISS) stages, were also integrated into the model. The ISS is a risk-staging system based on \u03b22 microglobulin and albumin blood tests. These clinical features, along with the gene expression data, were used to train the models for predicting multiple myeloma progression. The overall workflow involved within-cohort and across-cohort validation, with 5-fold cross-validation performed within each cohort to evaluate the model's performance.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the model integrates both gene expression profiles and clinical features to predict the progression of multiple myeloma. The gene expression data consists of a large number of features, with 18,994, 20,514, 20,514, and 24,128 gene expression features for the cohorts EMTAB4032, GSE24080UAMS, HOVON65, and MMRF, respectively. All of these genes are used as features in the model.\n\nIn addition to the gene expression data, clinical features such as age and International Staging System (ISS) stages are included. For these clinical features, a separate linear regression model is built to predict the outcomes. The results from this model are then stacked with the gene expression-based prediction. After experimenting with different proportions, it was found that using 50% from each model yielded the best performance.\n\nThe final model combines the gene expression profiles and clinical features, resulting in a comprehensive set of input parameters. The specific number of parameters used in the model can vary depending on the cohort and the preprocessing steps applied to the data. However, the integration of gene expression and clinical features ensures that the model captures a wide range of relevant information for predicting multiple myeloma progression.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized gene expression profiles and clinical features as input for our prognostic model. The number of gene expression features varied across the cohorts, with 18,994 features for the EMTAB4032 cohort, 20,514 features for both the GSE24080UAMS and HOVON65 cohorts, and 24,128 features for the MMRF cohort. All available genes were used as features without initial feature selection.\n\nTo identify progression-related genes, we employed a random forest regression model using the expression data and GuanRank hazard score as the target value. Feature importance values for all genes were extracted and sorted. We then calculated a combined importance value for each gene using the proportions of each cohort as weights. After sorting, we selected 342 genes with an importance value greater than 0.01. This selection process was performed using the entire dataset, not just the training set, to ensure a comprehensive identification of relevant genes.\n\nIn addition to gene expression data, we integrated clinical features such as age and International Staging System (ISS) stages. These clinical features were combined with the gene expression data to improve the prediction performance of our model. The integration of these features was done through a stacking approach, where predictions from gene expression data and clinical data were combined. This method enhanced the model's accuracy and robustness across different cohorts.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed a robust framework that integrates gene expression profiles and clinical features to predict the progression of multiple myeloma (MM). The GuanRank-GPR model, which combines GuanRank and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), was used to achieve the best prediction performance. This model converts the original survival data into complete ranking scores, allowing for the effective use of machine learning algorithms.\n\nThe number of parameters in our model is indeed larger than the number of training points, given the high-dimensional nature of gene expression data. To address potential overfitting, we implemented several strategies. First, we used cross-validation techniques to ensure that our model generalized well to unseen data. Specifically, we performed cross-cohort validation, where the model was trained on one cohort and tested on another, demonstrating robust performance across different datasets. Additionally, we integrated clinical features such as age and International Staging System (ISS) scores, which provided additional context and reduced the risk of overfitting to the gene expression data alone.\n\nTo rule out underfitting, we compared our GuanRank-GPR model with other conventional survival prediction models, including GPR direct regression on progression-free survival, Lasso-Cox proportional hazards model, and random survival forests. Our model consistently outperformed these alternatives in terms of integrated area under the receiving operator characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and C-index, indicating that it captured the underlying patterns in the data effectively. Furthermore, we stacked predictions from gene expression data and clinical data, which improved the model's performance across all cohorts. This approach ensured that the model was neither too simple nor too complex, striking a balance that avoided both overfitting and underfitting.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several regularization methods to prevent overfitting and enhance the robustness of our models. One of the key techniques used was the Lasso-Cox proportional hazards model. This method incorporates L1 regularization, which adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients. This helps in reducing the complexity of the model by driving some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection and preventing overfitting.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) in our final model. GPR inherently includes a form of regularization through its kernel functions, which control the smoothness and complexity of the learned function. This helps in avoiding overfitting by ensuring that the model does not capture noise in the data.\n\nFurthermore, we integrated clinical features such as age and International Staging System (ISS) stages with gene expression profiles. By stacking the predictions from these different types of data, we were able to improve the model's performance and reduce the risk of overfitting. This approach leverages the complementary information provided by clinical and genomic data, leading to more accurate and robust predictions.\n\nIn summary, our study employed Lasso-Cox regularization, Gaussian Process Regression, and the integration of clinical features to prevent overfitting and enhance the predictive performance of our models.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations, optimization schedule, model files, and optimization parameters used in our study are available. The model is dockerized and publicly accessible, ensuring reproducibility and ease of use. It has been registered in bio.tools with the identifier biotools: Multiple Myeloma survival prediction, and in SciCrunch with the identifier RRID:SCR_017651. This dockerized environment includes both the data and the reproducible code necessary to run the model. The dockerization process ensures that the model can be executed in a consistent environment, regardless of the underlying hardware or software configurations. This approach facilitates the sharing and validation of our findings by other researchers in the field.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model presented in this study is not entirely a black-box model. While it leverages advanced machine learning techniques such as Gaussian process regression (GPR) and random forests, which are known for their complexity, efforts have been made to enhance its interpretability.\n\nOne key aspect of interpretability in our model is the identification of important gene signatures related to multiple myeloma (MM) progression. By using random forests regression, we were able to extract feature importance values for all genes in the dataset. This allowed us to identify a set of 342 gene determinants that are crucial for predicting MM progression. These genes were selected based on their importance values, which were combined using the proportions of each cohort among the four cohorts used in the study.\n\nTo further understand the functional properties of these gene sets, we performed Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. This analysis revealed that most of the significantly enriched biological processes are related to the cell cycle or chromosomal instability. This finding provides valuable insights into the molecular basis of MM progression and highlights potential targets for future research and clinical interventions.\n\nAdditionally, we constructed a mammalian functional network to put these genes into context. This network was built using a Bayesian integration of diverse genetic and functional genomic data, including protein-protein interactions, homologous functional interactome, phenotype and disease, expression, and phylogenetic profiles. By performing community clustering in this network, we were able to identify enrichment functions for each cluster, further enhancing the interpretability of our model.\n\nIn summary, while the model incorporates complex machine learning techniques, it also provides clear examples of interpretability through the identification of key gene signatures and their associated biological processes. This makes the model not only powerful in predicting MM progression but also informative in understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms.",
  "model/output": "The model presented in our study is primarily a regression model. It is designed to predict the progression of multiple myeloma (MM) by integrating gene expression profiles and clinical features. The output of the model is a continuous ranking score that represents the likelihood of disease progression. This score is derived using a non-parametric complete hazard ranking model, which maps right-censored survival data into a linear space. This allows for the application of machine learning techniques such as Gaussian process regression (GPR) and random forests to make predictions.\n\nThe model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as the integrated area under the receiving operator characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and the C-index. These metrics assess the model's ability to accurately predict the progression of MM across different cohorts. The integrated AUC measures time-dependent concordance, while the C-index estimates the probability that a randomly selected patient who has experienced an event has a higher risk score than a patient who has not experienced the event.\n\nIn summary, the model's output is a continuous regression score that indicates the risk of MM progression, and it is evaluated using standard regression performance metrics.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "The source code for the Multiple Myeloma Survival Prediction project is publicly available. The project includes data and a dockerized environment for training and prediction. This environment can be accessed via a Synapse link. The dockerized environment has been registered in bio.tools with the identifier biotools: Multiple Myeloma survival prediction, and in SciCrunch with the identifier RRID:SCR 017651. The project is licensed under GNU GPL v3.0, ensuring that it can be freely used, modified, and distributed. An archival copy of the code and data is also available via the GigaScience database GigaDB. The dockerized environment allows for platform-independent operation and supports multiple programming languages, including Perl, Python, and Matlab.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the GuanRank-GPR model involved several rigorous steps to ensure its robustness and accuracy. Initially, the model was trained on one cohort and then tested on another to assess its cross-cohort performance. This process was repeated for all possible pairs of the four available cohorts, resulting in 12 different training-test pairs. The performance was evaluated using two primary metrics: integrated AUC and C-index. These metrics provided a comprehensive assessment of the model's ability to predict multiple myeloma progression accurately.\n\nThe integrated AUC measures time-dependent concordance, taking into account the survival time distribution. It was calculated at specific intervals (14, 16, 18, 20, and 22 months) using weights derived from the Kaplan-Meier estimator of the censoring distribution. The C-index, on the other hand, estimates the probability that a randomly selected patient who has experienced an event has a higher risk score than a patient who has not. Both metrics are crucial for evaluating the goodness of fit for the survival model.\n\nAdditionally, the model's performance was compared against other survival prediction models, including GPR direct regression on progression-free survival, Lasso-Cox proportional hazards model, and random survival forests. The GuanRank-GPR model consistently outperformed these models in three out of four cohorts when evaluated by both integrated AUC and C-index. In the remaining cohort, it performed second best.\n\nTo further validate the model, we integrated gene expression profiles and clinical features. This integration significantly improved the prediction performance across all cohorts. The stacking model, which combined predictions from gene expression data and clinical data, showed better performance than models using either type of data alone. This approach highlighted the importance of incorporating diverse information sources to enhance predictive accuracy.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation method involved cross-cohort validation, comparison with other models, and integration of multiple data types. These steps ensured that the GuanRank-GPR model is robust, accurate, and capable of providing reliable predictions for multiple myeloma progression.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed two primary performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of our survival prediction models: the integrated area under the receiving operator characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and the C-index.\n\nThe integrated AUC is a time-dependent measure that assesses the concordance of predictions with the actual survival times. It is calculated by integrating the time-dependent AUC values, which are determined at specific intervals (e.g., 14, 16, 18, 20, and 22 months) using weights derived from the survival time distribution. This metric provides a comprehensive evaluation of model performance over time, accounting for the censored nature of survival data.\n\nThe C-index, also known as Harrell's C-index, estimates the probability that a randomly chosen pair of patients is correctly ordered by the model in terms of their survival times. It is a widely used metric in survival analysis and provides a measure of the model's discriminative ability.\n\nThese metrics are well-established in the literature and are commonly used to evaluate the performance of survival prediction models. The integrated AUC and C-index together offer a robust assessment of model performance, capturing both the time-dependent concordance and the overall discriminative power of the predictions.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we conducted a comprehensive comparison of our proposed model with several publicly available survival prediction methods using benchmark datasets. Specifically, we evaluated four different survival prediction models: the combination of GuanRank and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), GPR with direct regression on progression-free survival, Lasso-Cox proportional hazards model, and random survival forests. These models were chosen because they represent a range of approaches commonly used in survival analysis, from parametric methods like Cox models to non-parametric methods like random survival forests.\n\nTo ensure a fair and unbiased evaluation, we utilized datasets from the Multiple Myeloma DREAM Challenge, which included the largest training and unpublished test datasets for multiple myeloma (MM) available at the time. This challenge provided an opportunity to evaluate our algorithms on held-out, previously unseen benchmark datasets, ensuring that our results were robust and generalizable.\n\nIn addition to comparing with these established methods, we also performed evaluations against simpler baselines. For instance, we compared the performance of models using only gene expression data versus those using only clinical data. This allowed us to demonstrate the added value of integrating both types of data in our predictive models. The results showed that integrating gene expression profiles and clinical features consistently improved prediction performance across multiple cohorts, as evaluated by integrated AUC and C-index metrics.\n\nFurthermore, we assessed the robustness of our GuanRank-GPR model in a cross-cohort fashion. By training the model on one cohort and making predictions on another, we demonstrated that our model could generalize well across different datasets, indicating its robustness to cohort bias. This cross-cohort evaluation is crucial for developing models that can be applied to new, unseen patient data.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "Evaluation Confidence\n\nThe performance of the models was evaluated using two primary metrics: integrated AUC and C-index. These metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of the models' predictive accuracy over time. The integrated AUC measures time-dependent concordance, taking into account the survival time distribution. This metric was calculated at specific intervals (14, 16, 18, 20, and 22 months) using weights derived from the Kaplan-Meier estimator of the censoring distribution. The C-index, on the other hand, estimates the probability that a randomly chosen pair of patients is correctly ordered in terms of their survival times.\n\nThe GuanRank-GPR model demonstrated robust performance across multiple cohorts, consistently ranking either first or second in both integrated AUC and C-index metrics. This indicates a high level of confidence in the model's predictive capabilities. The cross-cohort evaluation further supports the model's robustness, as it performed well even when trained on one cohort and tested on another, showing values greater than 0.5 in all cases.\n\nStatistical significance was addressed through the use of confidence intervals and p-values in the evaluation of the models. The results indicated that the improvements in performance were statistically significant, particularly when integrating gene expression profiles and clinical features. This integration led to consistent increases in both integrated AUC and C-index across most cohorts, except for a few specific cases where the performance was slightly worse.\n\nThe feature importance analysis identified a key set of 342 gene determinants related to multiple myeloma progression. Functional enrichment analysis of these genes revealed significant associations with biological processes related to the cell cycle and chromosomal instability. This provides additional confidence in the biological relevance of the model's predictions.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation of the GuanRank-GPR model included rigorous statistical methods and cross-cohort validation, providing a high level of confidence in its superior performance compared to other models and baselines. The integration of gene expression and clinical data further enhanced the model's predictive accuracy, supported by statistically significant improvements in performance metrics.",
