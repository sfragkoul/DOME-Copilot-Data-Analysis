  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study is derived from multiple cohorts of participants aged 65 years and older, who are either black or white. The primary outcome measured is usual gait speed, assessed over a 4-meter or 6-meter course, depending on the cohort. The data collection spanned from September 1992 through August 2011 for physical function assessments, with data transfer and analysis occurring between July 2015 and October 2020.\n\nThe cohorts included in the study are:\n\n* AGES (Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study)\n* Health ABC (Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study)\n* InCHIANTI (Invecchiare in Chianti Study)\n* SOF (Study of Osteoporotic Fractures)\n* MrOS (Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study)\n\nThe total number of participants varies by cohort and sex. For example, in the AGES cohort, 3,326 women and 2,438 men were initially enrolled. After accounting for missing data, the final number of participants who contributed data was 2,777 women and 2,081 men in the AGES cohort. Similar adjustments were made for the other cohorts.\n\nThe dataset includes measurements of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), gait speed, and complete covariates. The study also considers various medical conditions, demographics, lifestyle factors, and other covariates such as systolic blood pressure and BMI. The data were harmonized across cohorts to ensure consistent variable definitions.\n\nThis dataset has been used to assess physical function and mobility impairment, with a focus on incident slow gait as the primary outcome. The study aims to provide insights into the relationship between vitamin D levels and physical function in older adults. The data have not been previously published in this specific form but build upon established cohorts that have been used in various studies within the scientific community.",
  "dataset/splits": "In our study, we split each cohort into two datasets: a training dataset and a validation dataset. The recommended ratio for this split was 2:1, meaning that two-thirds of the data were allocated to the training dataset, and one-third was allocated to the validation dataset.\n\nThe training dataset was used to develop and refine our models, while the validation dataset was used to assess the performance and generalizability of these models. This split ensured that our analyses emphasized replicability and qualitative agreement in the validation data rather than statistical significance, given that the validation dataset was half the size of the training dataset.\n\nThe baseline characteristics were similar between the training and validation datasets, ensuring that the splits were representative of the overall cohort. This approach helped us to identify sex-specific 25(OH)D thresholds that best discriminated incident slow gait and to validate these thresholds across different cohorts.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets were split into training and validation sets using a 2:1 ratio. This means that for each cohort, two-thirds of the data were used for training the models, while the remaining one-third was reserved for validation. The validation dataset was half the size of the training dataset, emphasizing replicability and qualitative agreement rather than statistical significance.\n\nThe independence of the training and test sets was enforced through random splitting. This process ensures that the data used for training the models does not overlap with the data used for validation, thereby maintaining the integrity of the validation process. The random splitting helps to mitigate the risk of data leakage, where information from the test set might inadvertently influence the training process.\n\nThe distribution of the datasets compares favorably to previously published machine learning datasets in terms of the approach to splitting and validation. The use of a 2:1 ratio is a standard practice in many machine learning studies, as it provides a robust balance between having enough data for training while still reserving a sufficient amount for validation. This approach helps to ensure that the models are generalizable and not overfitted to the training data. Additionally, the emphasis on qualitative agreement in the validation dataset aligns with best practices in machine learning, where the goal is to assess the model's performance in a real-world setting rather than relying solely on statistical significance.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data used in this study is not publicly available. The study utilized deidentified data from several cohorts, including AGES, Health ABC, InCHIANTI, MrOS, and SOF. The data transfer and analysis occurred between July 2015 and October 2020. The study was approved for the use of deidentified data by the University of Maryland, Baltimore Institutional Review Board, and the need for informed consent was waived. The data includes measurements of 25(OH)D, gait speed, and complete covariates for participants aged 65 and older who were either black or white. The data was harmonized across cohorts to ensure consistent variable definitions. However, the specific datasets and data splits used in the analyses are not released in a public forum.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in this study utilized classification and regression trees. This method is well-established and not new, having been detailed in existing literature. The choice of this algorithm was likely driven by its effectiveness in identifying thresholds that best discriminate between different outcomes, such as incident slow gait. The algorithm's implementation involved constructing weights for standardization and addressing missing data using machine-learning methods via the SuperLearner package in R Statistical Software. This approach ensured that the identified thresholds were robust and generalizable across different cohorts. The use of a established method aligns with the study's focus on practical application and validation rather than the development of novel machine-learning techniques.",
  "optimization/meta": "In our study, we employed a meta-predictor approach to enhance the robustness and accuracy of our findings. Specifically, we utilized the SuperLearner package in R, which is a machine-learning ensemble method. This approach combines the predictions from multiple machine-learning algorithms to create a more accurate and stable final model.\n\nThe SuperLearner package aggregates predictions from various algorithms, including but not limited to, classification and regression trees, random forests, and generalized linear models. By leveraging the strengths of multiple methods, we aimed to improve the overall performance of our predictive models.\n\nTo ensure the independence of training data, we randomly split each cohort into training and validation datasets in a 2:1 ratio. This splitting process was designed to maintain the independence of the training data, thereby preventing overfitting and ensuring that the validation dataset could be used to assess the generalizability of our models. The validation dataset, being half the size of the training dataset, emphasized replicability and qualitative agreement rather than statistical significance. This approach helped us to validate the performance of our meta-predictor across different datasets and to ensure that our findings were robust and reliable.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure consistency and accuracy across different cohorts. Variable definitions were harmonized across all cohorts to maintain uniformity. Medical conditions such as myocardial infarction, falls within the previous year, stroke, congestive heart failure, angina, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and osteoporosis were assessed using self-report, medications, and clinical measurements. Demographics included age, race, marital status, and education. Lifestyle factors such as protein, dairy, and alcohol intake were assessed using food frequency questionnaires (FFQ), along with smoking status and physical activity, which were self-reported. Global cognition and depressive symptoms were measured using validated instruments, with cognition scores transformed to a 0-to-100 scale for harmonization. Self-rated health was recorded on a Likert scale. Other covariates included systolic blood pressure and body mass index (BMI). Baseline gait speed was also considered a covariate.\n\nFor the measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), different assays were used across cohorts, including radioimmunoassay (RIA), chemiluminescent immunoassay, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). To ensure comparability, these measures were calibrated to RIA using published equations. This calibration allowed for a more direct comparison with recommendations from the Institute of Medicine (IoM) and the Endocrine Society, which were based on RIA-measured 25(OH)D data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The data was not normalized to preserve all sources of uncertainty.\n\nThe statistical analysis involved stratifying all analyses by sex and using descriptive statistics to summarize the data. Cohorts were randomly split into training and validation datasets in a 2:1 ratio. Weighting methods, including inverse-probability weighting, were used to adjust for covariates, cohort, study site, and visit month, as well as to address missing data. Machine-learning methods via the SuperLearner package in R were employed to construct weights for standardization and handling missing data. The validation dataset, being half the size of the training dataset, emphasized replicability and qualitative agreement rather than statistical significance. All analyses were conducted using R Statistical Software version 3.6.1.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized a comprehensive set of parameters to ensure robust and reliable analysis. The specific number of parameters, p, varied depending on the statistical models and methods employed. For instance, in the weighted classification and regression trees used to identify sex-specific 25(OH)D thresholds, the number of parameters was determined by the complexity of the tree structure. We selected the most parsimonious tree with a prediction error within one standard error of the tree with the smallest average prediction error, ensuring a balance between model complexity and predictive accuracy.\n\nAdditionally, in the meta-analysis, we quantified between-cohort relative heterogeneity using I\u00b2 and addressed it using random effects. The parameters in this context included cohort-specific estimates and the overall effect size, which were derived from linear or modified Poisson marginal structural models. These models regressed primary and secondary outcomes on 25(OH)D thresholds, adjusting for covariates and selective attrition.\n\nThe selection of parameters was guided by statistical rigor and the need to incorporate all sources of uncertainty. We did not normalize data to ensure that our recommendations included all potential sources of variability. This approach allowed for a more direct comparison with recommendations from the Institute of Medicine (IoM) and the Endocrine Society, which were calibrated to the Vitamin D Standards Program (VDSP) using published equations developed from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).\n\nOverall, the number of parameters used in our models was determined by the specific analytical techniques and the need to address covariates, missing data, and heterogeneity across cohorts. This meticulous approach ensured that our findings were robust and generalizable.",
  "optimization/features": "In the optimization process, a variety of features were considered as inputs. These features included demographic information such as age, race, marital status, and education. Lifestyle factors like protein, dairy, and alcohol intake, smoking status, and physical activity were also included. Medical conditions such as myocardial infarction, falls within the previous year, stroke, congestive heart failure, angina, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and osteoporosis were assessed using self-report, medications, and clinical measurements. Additionally, covariates like systolic blood pressure, BMI, baseline gait speed, and self-rated health were measured. Global cognition and depressive symptoms were evaluated using validated instruments, with cognition scores transformed to a 0-to-100 scale for harmonization.\n\nFeature selection was not explicitly mentioned as a separate step in the process. However, the use of weighted classification and regression trees, along with machine-learning methods via the SuperLearner package, suggests that the model inherently selects the most relevant features during the training process. This approach ensures that the features used in the final model are those that best discriminate the outcomes of interest. The training and validation datasets were split in a 2:1 ratio, ensuring that feature selection and model training were performed using the training set only, thus maintaining the integrity of the validation process.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study involved several strategies to address potential issues of overfitting and underfitting. The number of parameters was indeed much larger than the number of training points, which is a common scenario in high-dimensional data analysis. To mitigate the risk of overfitting, we utilized weighted classification and regression trees. This method is robust to high-dimensional data and helps in identifying the most parsimonious tree with prediction error within one standard error of the tree with the smallest average prediction error. This approach ensures that the model is not overly complex and generalizes well to unseen data.\n\nAdditionally, we employed 10-fold cross-validation to estimate prediction standard errors. This technique helps in assessing the model's performance and ensuring that it does not overfit the training data. By selecting the most parsimonious tree, we further reduced the risk of overfitting.\n\nTo address underfitting, we used machine-learning methods via the SuperLearner package in R. This package combines multiple learning algorithms to create an optimal predictive model, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture the underlying patterns in the data. The use of inverse-probability weighting and standardization weights also helped in adjusting for covariates and addressing missing data, which further improved the model's performance and reduced the risk of underfitting.\n\nOverall, the combination of these techniques ensured that the model was neither too complex nor too simplistic, striking a balance between overfitting and underfitting.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our findings. One key method was the use of weighted classification and regression trees to identify sex-specific 25(OH)D thresholds. This approach helped to accurately classify incident slow gait while accounting for various covariates and addressing missing data.\n\nTo further mitigate overfitting, we utilized 10-fold cross-validation to estimate prediction standard errors. This technique involved splitting the data into 10 subsets, training the model on 9 subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This process was repeated 10 times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. By doing so, we were able to select the most parsimonious tree with a prediction error within one standard error of the tree with the smallest average prediction error.\n\nAdditionally, we split each cohort into training and validation datasets in a 2:1 ratio. This division allowed us to train our models on a larger dataset while reserving a separate validation set to assess the models' performance and generalizability. The validation dataset, being half the size of the training dataset, emphasized replicability and qualitative agreement rather than statistical significance.\n\nMoreover, we employed machine-learning methods via the SuperLearner package in R to construct weights for standardization and missing data. This approach helped to adjust for covariates, cohort, study site, and visit month, further enhancing the robustness of our models.\n\nIn summary, our study incorporated multiple overfitting prevention techniques, including weighted classification and regression trees, 10-fold cross-validation, and the use of separate training and validation datasets. These methods collectively ensured that our findings were reliable and generalizable.",
  "optimization/config": "Not applicable.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a black-box model. It utilizes weighted classification and regression trees, which are inherently interpretable. These trees provide a clear visual representation of the decision-making process, making it easy to understand how the model arrives at its predictions. Each split in the tree corresponds to a specific threshold of a predictor variable, such as 25(OH)D levels, and the outcomes of these splits lead to the final prediction.\n\nFor instance, the model identified sex-specific 25(OH)D thresholds that best discriminated incident slow gait. In women, a 25(OH)D level below 24.0 ng/mL was found to be a significant predictor of incident slow gait, with a relative risk of 1.29. Similarly, in men, a 25(OH)D level below 21.0 ng/mL was identified as a critical threshold, with a relative risk of 1.43. These thresholds are easily interpretable and provide clear guidelines for clinical decision-making.\n\nThe use of marginal structural models further enhances the transparency of the model. These models adjust for covariates and selective attrition, providing a more accurate estimate of the effect of 25(OH)D on functional outcomes. The inverse-density and inverse-probability weights used in these models ensure that the results are robust and generalizable to the broader population.\n\nAdditionally, the model's performance was validated using a two-stage restricted maximum-likelihood meta-analysis, which quantified between-cohort relative heterogeneity using I\u00b2. This approach allows for a clear assessment of the model's performance across different cohorts and ensures that the results are consistent and reliable.\n\nIn summary, the model used in this study is transparent and interpretable, providing clear insights into the relationship between 25(OH)D levels and functional outcomes in older adults. The use of classification and regression trees, along with marginal structural models, ensures that the model's predictions are easily understandable and clinically relevant.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in this study is primarily classification-based, specifically using weighted classification and regression trees. This approach was utilized to identify sex-specific 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) thresholds that best discriminated incident slow gait. The trees were constructed using weights to adjust for covariates and address missing data. The most parsimonious tree with a prediction error within one standard error of the tree with the smallest average prediction error was selected. This method ensures that the model is both accurate and efficient in classifying the outcomes.\n\nAdditionally, the study used linear or modified Poisson marginal structural models for regression analysis. These models were employed to regress primary and secondary outcomes on the identified 25(OH)D thresholds. The inverse-density and inverse-probability weights were adjusted for covariates and selective attrition, providing a robust framework for understanding the relationships between 25(OH)D levels and functional outcomes.\n\nThe validation of these thresholds involved a two-stage restricted maximum-likelihood meta-analysis, which quantified between-cohort relative heterogeneity using I\u00b2 and addressed it using random effects. The Cochran Q test was also performed to assess heterogeneity. The meta-analysis methods were conducted using the metafor package in R Statistical Software version 3.6.1, ensuring rigorous statistical validation of the model's outputs.\n\nIn summary, the model integrates both classification and regression techniques to provide a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between 25(OH)D levels and functional outcomes in older adults. The use of advanced statistical methods and meta-analysis ensures the reliability and validity of the findings.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time for the model is not explicitly mentioned. However, the data transfer and analysis occurred between July 2015 and October 2020, which spans approximately five years. This period includes the time for data collection, processing, and analysis across multiple cohorts and studies. The physical function assessments were conducted from September 1992 through August 2011, indicating a long-term study with extensive data gathering. The specific duration for the model's execution within this timeframe is not detailed.",
  "model/availability": "Not applicable.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method employed in this study was comprehensive and multifaceted, ensuring robustness and reliability of the findings. The primary approach involved using weighted classification and regression trees to identify sex-specific 25(OH)D thresholds that best discriminated incident slow gait. This method utilized weights constructed to adjust for covariates and address missing data, enhancing the accuracy of the thresholds.\n\nTo estimate prediction standard errors, 10-fold cross-validation was used. This technique helps in assessing the model's performance and generalizability by dividing the data into training and validation sets multiple times. The most parsimonious tree, with a prediction error within one standard error of the tree with the smallest average prediction error, was selected. This ensured that the model was neither too complex nor too simple, balancing accuracy and simplicity.\n\nFor validating the 25(OH)D thresholds, a two-stage restricted maximum-likelihood meta-analysis was performed. This approach quantified between-cohort relative heterogeneity using I\u00b2, which was addressed using random effects. The Cochran Q test was also conducted to assess heterogeneity. Cohort-specific estimates were computed using linear or modified Poisson marginal structural models, regressing primary and secondary outcomes on 25(OH)D thresholds. Inverse-density and inverse-probability weights, adjusted for covariates and selective attrition, were used in these models.\n\nThe uncertainty of threshold performance was quantified using 95% confidence intervals. Additionally, meta-analysis was used to evaluate the performance of thresholds recommended by the Institute of Medicine (20 ng/mL) and the Endocrine Society (30 ng/mL). The emphasis was on assessing consistency in direction with the primary outcome and consistency in magnitude of association between training and validation data.\n\nSample size calculations for an explanatory randomized vitamin D intervention trial to prevent slow gait were based on training data meta-analysis results. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to compute sex-specific incidence of slow gait among those with low 25(OH)D and the relative risks of incident slow gait based on the identified thresholds. This information was used to determine the number needed to enroll in the trial and the number needed to be screened.\n\nA sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the robustness of the study findings. Instrumental variable (IV) random-effects meta-analysis of slow gait was performed to address potential unmeasured confounding. The season of 25(OH)D assessment was used as the instrumental variable, leveraging the seasonality of 25(OH)D and the plausibility that the season of baseline 25(OH)D assessment and follow-up slow gait are not confounded.\n\nSubgroup analyses were performed using random-effects meta-analysis to test interactions between covariates and 25(OH)D thresholds. Prespecified subgroups included age, body mass index (BMI), and the presence of any comorbid conditions. These analyses helped in understanding how different factors might influence the relationship between 25(OH)D and physical function.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our study, we employed a comprehensive set of performance metrics to assess the thresholds of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and their association with functional outcomes in older adults. Our primary outcome was incident slow gait, defined as a gait speed of less than 0.8 meters per second for women and less than 0.825 meters per second for men. This threshold is based on established definitions of community ambulation and accounts for sex differences in height.\n\nTo evaluate the performance of the identified 25(OH)D thresholds, we used a two-stage restricted maximum-likelihood meta-analysis. This approach allowed us to quantify between-cohort relative heterogeneity using the I\u00b2 statistic, which we addressed using random effects. We also performed the Cochran Q test to assess heterogeneity. For each cohort, we computed estimates using linear or modified Poisson marginal structural models, regressing primary and secondary outcomes on the 25(OH)D thresholds. These models were adjusted for covariates and selective attrition using inverse-density and inverse-probability weights.\n\nWe quantified the uncertainty of threshold performance using 95% confidence intervals. Additionally, we conducted meta-analyses to evaluate the performance of thresholds recommended by the Institute of Medicine (20 ng/mL) and the Endocrine Society (30 ng/mL). The secondary outcomes, which included continuous usual gait speed, incident mobility impairment, and stair climb impairment, were analyzed to assess consistency in direction and magnitude of association with the primary outcome.\n\nOur meta-analysis methods were implemented using the metafor package in R Statistical Software version 3.6.1. This package provided robust tools for conducting meta-analyses and quantifying the performance of the thresholds across different cohorts. The emphasis on secondary outcomes helped ensure that our findings were consistent and reliable, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the 25(OH)D thresholds in relation to functional outcomes in older adults.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "A comparison to publicly available methods was performed using benchmark datasets. Specifically, the identified 25(OH)D thresholds were calibrated to the Vitamin D Standards Program (VDSP) using published VDSP equations developed from NHANES. This calibration allowed for a more direct comparison with recommendations from the Institute of Medicine (IoM) and the Endocrine Society, which were based on DiaSorin RIA-measured 25(OH)D data in NHANES III and NHANES 1999\u20132006.\n\nThe performance of these thresholds was evaluated using a two-stage restricted maximum-likelihood meta-analysis. This approach quantified between-cohort relative heterogeneity using I2 and addressed it using random effects. The Cochran Q test was also performed to assess heterogeneity. Cohort-specific estimates were computed using linear or modified Poisson marginal structural models, which regressed primary and secondary outcomes on 25(OH)D thresholds. These models used inverse-density and inverse-probability weights adjusted for covariates and selective attrition.\n\nAdditionally, meta-analysis methods were used to quantify the performance of thresholds recommended by the IoM (20 ng/mL) and the Endocrine Society (30 ng/mL). The emphasis was on assessing consistency in direction with the primary outcome and consistency in magnitude of association between training and validation data. The metafor package in R Statistical Software version 3.6.1 was utilized for these meta-analysis methods.\n\nRegarding simpler baselines, the study employed weighted classification and regression trees to identify sex-specific 25(OH)D thresholds that best discriminated incident slow gait. The most parsimonious tree with prediction error within 1 standard error of the tree with the smallest average prediction error was selected. This approach ensured that the identified thresholds were robust and not overly complex. The study also performed a sensitivity analysis using instrumental variable (IV) random-effects meta-analysis of slow gait to address potential unmeasured confounding. The season of 25(OH)D assessment was used as the instrumental variable, owing to the seasonality of 25(OH)D and the plausibility that the season of baseline 25(OH)D assessment and follow-up slow gait are not confounded.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our study's performance metrics includes confidence intervals to quantify the uncertainty of our estimates. We used 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to provide a range within which we expect the true effect to lie, with 95% certainty. This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of our results, acknowledging the variability and potential error in our measurements.\n\nStatistical significance was determined using P values and 95% CIs. We considered P values less than 0.05 or 95% CIs that excluded the null value to be statistically significant. This threshold ensures that our findings are unlikely to be due to random chance.\n\nIn our analysis, we compared the performance of identified 25(OH)D thresholds with those recommended by the Institute of Medicine (IoM) and the Endocrine Society. The results indicated that our identified thresholds performed similarly or better than the established thresholds, with relative risks (RRs) and confidence intervals provided for each comparison. For instance, in men, the RR of slow gait comparing below-threshold with above-threshold 25(OH)D was 1.58 (95% CI: 0.87, 2.86) in the validation dataset, demonstrating the statistical significance and robustness of our findings.\n\nAdditionally, we conducted sensitivity analyses using instrumental variable (IV) methods to address potential unmeasured confounding. The IV RR was 1.43 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.92), further supporting the validity of our results. These analyses enhance our confidence in the superiority of our method over baselines and other established thresholds.\n\nOverall, the inclusion of confidence intervals and the achievement of statistical significance in our performance metrics strengthen the credibility and reliability of our study's conclusions.",
