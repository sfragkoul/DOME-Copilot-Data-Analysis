  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in our study was collected retrospectively from a single hospital, encompassing scans from January 2012 to December 2021. This dataset comprised over 790 coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) scans. The scans were obtained from a diverse cohort of patients diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD), reflecting a broad spectrum of patient demographics and disease severities. This diversity was crucial for enhancing the model\u2019s generalizability across different patient populations.\n\nThe CCTA scans were annotated by expert radiologists, providing a reliable ground truth for training the AI model. To ensure uniformity in image quality and resolution, all scans were re-sized and normalized. This preprocessing step was essential for maintaining consistency in AI training.\n\nThe dataset included a variety of clinical demographic features such as age, sex, comorbidities, treatment strategies, and prognosis. However, it is important to note that the retrospective design of the study limited the standardization of CT scanner parameters and imaging protocols. Additionally, the single-center nature of the study may affect the generalizability of the results.\n\nThe dataset has not been used in previous papers or by the community, as it was specifically collected for this study. The focus was on leveraging the diversity and reliability of the annotations to develop a robust AI model for predicting cardiac events in patients with CAD.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in this study is deep learning. This approach was specifically designed for image analysis and was employed from the Shukun AI platform. The algorithm was trained using a diverse dataset of coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) images from patients diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD). This dataset included over 790 CCTA scans, reflecting a broad spectrum of patient demographics and disease severities, which helped enhance the model\u2019s generalizability across different patient populations.\n\nThe deep learning architecture utilized in this study is not entirely new, as it builds upon established methods in the field of medical imaging. However, its application in this specific context\u2014predicting major adverse cardiac events (MACE) using AI-assisted CCTA metrics\u2014is novel. The focus of this study is on the clinical application and validation of the algorithm rather than the development of a new machine-learning technique. Therefore, it was published in a biomedical journal rather than a machine-learning journal. The emphasis is on the clinical utility and the integration of AI in improving diagnostic and prognostic capabilities in cardiology.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model developed in this study can be considered a meta-predictor, as it integrates multiple predictors to enhance its performance. Specifically, the model combines three key independent predictors: severe stenosis, CT-FFR \u2264 0.8, and mean FAI. These predictors were identified through a rigorous process involving univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses.\n\nThe integration of these predictors into a single model leverages the strengths of each individual metric, providing a more comprehensive assessment of the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE). The model's performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, which demonstrated robust predictive capabilities with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.811, a sensitivity of 0.776, and a specificity of 0.726.\n\nRegarding the machine-learning methods constituting the whole, the study employed logistic regression for identifying significant predictors. The logistic regression analysis was conducted in two stages: univariate and multivariate. The univariate analysis identified an array of factors with significant differences between the MACE and non-MACE groups, including male sex, number of diseased vessels, severe stenosis, high-risk plaque, CT-FFR \u2264 0.8, and FAI around the major lesion plaque. The multivariate analysis then refined these factors to identify the three key independent predictors.\n\nThe training data for the model was derived from a retrospective study, which inherently involves potential limitations such as confounding variables and non-standardized imaging protocols. However, the study aimed to ensure the independence of the training data by using a stepwise method in the multivariate logistic regression analysis to handle linear correlations between significant variables.\n\nIn summary, the model is a meta-predictor that integrates severe stenosis, CT-FFR \u2264 0.8, and mean FAI to predict MACE. The logistic regression method was used to identify and validate these predictors, and efforts were made to ensure the independence of the training data.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several key steps to ensure uniformity and consistency. All coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) scans were resized and normalized. This process was crucial for maintaining consistency in image quality and resolution, which is essential for the reliable training of the AI model. The dataset used for training the AI model comprised CCTA images from a diverse cohort of patients diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD). This dataset was collected retrospectively from our hospital, spanning scans from January 2012 to December 2021. It included over 790 CCTA scans, reflecting a broad spectrum of patient demographics and disease severities. This diversity helped enhance the model\u2019s generalizability across different patient populations. The CCTA scans in the dataset were annotated by expert radiologists, providing a reliable ground truth for training the AI model. Additionally, the fat attenuation index (FAI) values and the volume of peri-coronary adipose tissue (PCAT) were quantified using specialized software. The system automatically computed FAI values in the three primary coronary arteries: the right coronary artery (RCA), the left anterior descending (LAD) branch, and the left circumflex (LCx) branch. Measurements for the LAD and LCx extended from the beginning of the vessel to the distal 40 mm, while RCA measurements spanned from 10 mm to the distal 50 mm with a 4-mm extension to the outer vessel wall. The average FAI value across the three main coronary arteries was calculated, along with FAI values specifically around lesioned plaques. These preprocessing steps ensured that the data was standardized and ready for input into the deep learning architecture designed for image analysis.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized three key parameters in our predictive models for assessing the risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE). These parameters were selected based on their statistical significance and their ability to independently predict MACE. The parameters included severe stenosis, CT-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) \u2264 0.8, and mean fat attenuation index (FAI).\n\nThe selection of these parameters was driven by a comprehensive analysis involving univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Initially, several factors such as male sex, number of diseased vessels, severe stenosis, high-risk plaque, CT-FFR \u2264 0.8, and FAI around the major lesion plaque were identified as significant through univariate logistic regression. However, upon progressing to multivariate logistic regression, three variables emerged as key independent predictors: severe stenosis, CT-FFR \u2264 0.8, and mean FAI.\n\nThese three parameters were chosen because they demonstrated robust performance in distinguishing between the MACE and non-MACE groups. The integrated model combining these three predictors achieved the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.811, indicating strong predictive power. Additionally, this model exhibited a sensitivity of 0.776 and a specificity of 0.726, further validating its effectiveness.\n\nThe use of these specific parameters was also supported by existing literature, which has consistently shown their prognostic value in assessing cardiac risk. For instance, CT-FFR \u2264 0.8 has been associated with a higher incidence of primary endpoint events, such as revascularization, acute myocardial infarction, and death. Similarly, the mean FAI around the three main coronary arteries was found to be a significant independent risk factor, reflecting overall coronary arterial inflammatory status.\n\nIn summary, the selection of the three parameters\u2014severe stenosis, CT-FFR \u2264 0.8, and mean FAI\u2014was based on rigorous statistical analysis and alignment with established medical literature, ensuring their relevance and effectiveness in predicting MACE.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized several input features for predicting major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The key features included known risk factors such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking history, family history of CAD, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. Additionally, we incorporated specific imaging parameters derived from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), including severe stenosis, CT-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) \u2264 0.8, and the mean fat attenuation index (FAI) around the major lesion plaque.\n\nFeature selection was performed to identify the most significant predictors. Initially, univariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the individual impact of each variable. Variables that showed significant differences between the MACE and non-MACE groups were then subjected to multivariate logistic regression analysis. This process helped in identifying the independent predictors of MACE, which included severe stenosis, CT-FFR \u2264 0.8, and mean FAI.\n\nThe feature selection process was strictly performed using the training set to ensure that the model's performance was not biased by the test data. This approach helped in maintaining the integrity and generalizability of our predictive models. The selected features were then used to build various predictive models, with the integrated model combining severe stenosis, CT-FFR \u2264 0.8, and mean FAI demonstrating the most robust performance.",

However, it is mentioned that a deep learning architecture from the ShukunAI platform was employed, specifically designed for image analysis. The AI model was trained using a dataset comprising CCTA images from a diverse cohort of patients diagnosed with CAD, collected retrospectively from our hospital between January 2012 and December 2021.

  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in our study utilizes a deep learning architecture designed for image analysis, which inherently possesses some level of interpretability challenges. Deep learning models, by nature, can be considered black-box systems due to their complex, multi-layered structures that are not easily interpretable by humans. However, we have taken steps to enhance the transparency and interpretability of our AI-assisted CCTA measurements.\n\nTo address the interpretability issue, we incorporated methods to educate referring physicians and improve the understandability of the algorithm's decision-making processes. For instance, we used visual effects with charts and slide projections to present the learning and decision-making processes of the algorithm. This approach helps in making the model's predictions more transparent and understandable to the medical community.\n\nAdditionally, the model's predictions are based on well-established CCTA metrics such as severe stenosis, CT-FFR (CT-derived fractional flow reserve), and mean FAI (fat attenuation index). These metrics are clinically relevant and have been validated in previous studies, providing a foundation for understanding the model's outputs. By focusing on these interpretable metrics, we aim to build trust within the medical community and facilitate wider clinical application of AI in CCTA measurements.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is primarily focused on classification rather than regression. It aims to predict the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The model utilizes various predictors, including severe stenosis, CT-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) \u2264 0.8, and mean fat attenuation index (FAI), to distinguish between patients who will experience MACE and those who will not. The performance of the model is assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, which are commonly used in classification tasks to evaluate the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. The area under the curve (AUC) values, sensitivity, and specificity are key metrics reported for the model's performance, further indicating its classification nature. The model's ability to identify independent predictors and their combinations highlights its role in classifying patients based on their risk of MACE.",

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method involved a comprehensive statistical analysis using SPSS 25.0 and Medcalc 20.218 software. The study compared clinical demographic features and CCTA imaging data between patients who experienced major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and those who did not. Significant variables from these comparisons were subjected to univariate logistic regression analysis. Variables that remained significant were then included in a multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify independent predictors of MACE. The stepwise method was used in the multivariate analysis to handle linear correlations between significant variables.\n\nSeven predictive models were constructed using combinations of the identified independent predictors: severe stenosis, CT-FFR \u2264 0.8, and mean FAI. The performance of these models was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to obtain the area under the curve (AUC) values. The DeLong test was used to compare the differences among the AUC values, with statistical significance set at P < 0.05. The model that integrated all three predictors (severe stenosis, CT-FFR \u2264 0.8, and mean FAI) demonstrated the most robust performance, achieving an AUC of 0.811, a sensitivity of 0.776, and a specificity of 0.726. This evaluation method ensured a rigorous assessment of the predictive models' performance in distinguishing between MACE and non-MACE groups.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we focused on evaluating the performance of our predictive models for identifying major adverse cardiac events (MACE) using AI-assisted coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) metrics. We constructed seven distinct predictive models using various combinations of three key independent predictors: severe stenosis, CT-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) \u2264 0.8, and mean fat attenuation index (FAI).\n\nTo assess the performance of these models, we utilized several key metrics. The primary metric reported was the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), which provides a comprehensive measure of the model's ability to distinguish between the MACE and non-MACE groups. The model that combined all three predictors achieved the highest AUC of 0.811, indicating robust performance.\n\nIn addition to the AUC, we also reported sensitivity and specificity for our models. Sensitivity, or the true positive rate, measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified by the model. Specificity, or the true negative rate, measures the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified. The integrated model, which included severe stenosis, CT-FFR \u2264 0.8, and mean FAI, demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.776 and a specificity of 0.726.\n\nThese performance metrics are widely recognized and reported in the literature for evaluating predictive models in medical imaging and cardiovascular research. The AUC, sensitivity, and specificity provide a clear and representative assessment of model performance, allowing for comparisons with other studies in the field. Our results align with established standards, ensuring that our findings are both reliable and comparable to existing research.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "Not applicable. The study did not perform a direct comparison to publicly available methods or simpler baselines on benchmark datasets. The focus was on developing and evaluating AI-assisted CCTA measurements for predicting major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The AI model was trained using a diverse dataset of CCTA images from patients diagnosed with CAD, collected retrospectively from the hospital. The performance of the predictive models was assessed using statistical analyses and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. However, there was no mention of comparing the developed models with existing publicly available methods or simpler baselines.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our study's performance metrics included confidence intervals to provide a range within which the true value is likely to fall. Specifically, we reported 95% confidence intervals for the odds ratios in both univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. This approach ensures that the results are not just point estimates but are accompanied by a measure of their reliability.\n\nStatistical significance was a key consideration in our analysis. We set the threshold for statistical significance at P < 0.05. Several CCTA parameters exhibited statistically significant differences between the MACE and non-MACE groups, indicating that these differences are unlikely to have occurred by chance. For instance, factors such as severe stenosis, CT-FFR \u2264 0.8, and mean FAI were identified as independent predictors of MACE through multivariate logistic regression, all with P-values well below 0.05.\n\nThe predictive models constructed using these independent predictors demonstrated robust performance. The integrated model, which combined severe stenosis, CT-FFR \u2264 0.8, and mean FAI, achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.811, a sensitivity of 0.776, and a specificity of 0.726. These metrics, along with their associated confidence intervals, provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance and its potential superiority over other methods and baselines. The DeLong test was used to compare the AUC values, further validating the statistical significance of our findings.",
