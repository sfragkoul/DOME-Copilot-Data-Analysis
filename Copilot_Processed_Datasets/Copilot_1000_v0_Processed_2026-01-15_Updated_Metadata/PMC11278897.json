This multi-omics approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of the molecular changes occurring in response to D2-HG treatment. By identifying differentially expressed genes, proteins, and metabolites, the model provides a clear and detailed map of the biological pathways affected.\n\nSecondly, the use of hierarchical clustering and pathway enrichment analysis enhances the interpretability of the results. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering helps in grouping similar data points, revealing patterns and relationships within the dataset. Pathway enrichment analysis, conducted using databases like STRING, identifies enriched pathways and functional categories, providing insights into the biological processes that are significantly altered.\n\nAdditionally, the model includes statistical analyses and visualization techniques that make the results interpretable. For instance, principal component analysis (PCA) is used to visualize the separation between treatment and control groups, indicating the distinct molecular signatures induced by D2-HG. The reconstruction of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks further aids in understanding the interactions between differentially expressed proteins, highlighting key clusters involved in mitochondrial function, muscle contraction, and chromatin assembly.\n\nThe model also incorporates linear models adjusted for sex and batch information, ensuring that the results are robust and accounting for potential confounding variables. This statistical rigor adds to the transparency and reliability of the findings.\n\nIn summary, the model's transparency is demonstrated through its multi-omics integration, use of clustering and enrichment analyses, statistical rigor, and clear visualization techniques. These elements collectively provide a detailed and interpretable framework for understanding the molecular impacts of D2-HG treatment.",

  "evaluation/confidence": "The statistical analysis employed in this study ensures a high level of confidence in the results. Multiple methods were used to correct for multiple hypotheses, including the Benjamini-Hochberg method, which helps control the false discovery rate (FDR). For RNA-sequencing data, an FDR below 0.01 was considered statistically significant, while for proteomics and metabolomics, an FDR below 0.05 was used. This stringent threshold reduces the likelihood of Type I errors, enhancing the reliability of the findings.\n\nIn addition to FDR correction, various statistical tests were applied to assess the significance of the results. For example, one-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s posthoc test was used to compare groups, and normality was tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test. These tests provide a robust framework for identifying significant differences between experimental conditions.\n\nThe study also utilized unpaired t-tests with corrections such as Welch\u2019s correction and the two-step method by Benjamini, Krieger, and Yekutieli to ensure the statistical validity of comparisons between groups. These methods account for variability and potential biases, further strengthening the confidence in the results.\n\nMoreover, the use of linear models adjusted for sex and batch information, along with hierarchical clustering and correlation analyses, adds layers of statistical rigor. The linear models help in identifying multi-omics changes in response to treatments, while clustering and correlation analyses provide insights into the relationships between different datasets.\n\nOverall, the combination of these statistical approaches and the stringent significance thresholds used in the analysis ensures that the results are reliable and that the conclusions drawn are supported by robust statistical evidence.",
