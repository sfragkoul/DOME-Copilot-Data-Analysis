  "model/interpretability": "The model described in this publication is not a machine learning model, but rather a framework and educational approach designed to address COVID-19 vaccine distrust among Black patients. Therefore, the concept of interpretability as it applies to machine learning models does not directly translate here.\n\nHowever, the framework and educational module developed are designed to be transparent and easily understandable. The LEAPS framework, for instance, provides a structured approach to communication that can be clearly explained and demonstrated. The educational module includes a clinical case and a three-part video series, each less than 10 minutes long, which break down complex concepts into manageable parts. These videos likely include role-playing simulations that show how to apply Afrocentric approaches and LEAPS communication strategies in clinical practice, making the methods and strategies involved highly interpretable.\n\nThe transparency of the model is further ensured by the collaborative development process, which involved community practitioners, health centers, and academic institutions. This collaborative approach helps to ensure that the methods and strategies are not only clear but also culturally sensitive and effective in addressing the specific needs of Black communities. The use of real-life scenarios and simulations in the educational module also makes the framework and approaches more relatable and easier to understand for healthcare providers.",

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method for this project primarily focused on feasibility and community engagement rather than traditional statistical evaluation metrics. The intervention was developed in collaboration with several key organizations, including the Ontario Medical Association, the Black Physicians Association of Ontario, the TAIBU community health centre, and the University of Toronto Department of Family and Community Medicine. This collaborative approach ensured that the educational module was grounded in real-world needs and community insights.\n\nThe project involved creating an online educational module that included a clinical case and a webpage featuring a three-part video series. Each video was designed to be less than 10 minutes long, making the content accessible and easy to integrate into existing training programs. The module aimed to improve providers' comfort in discussing vaccine distrust and anti-Black racism in healthcare with Black patients.\n\nThe feasibility of the intervention was demonstrated through its successful creation and dissemination. The module was designed to be transferable across various models of training, including undergraduate medical education (UGME), postgraduate medical education (PGME), continuing medical education (CME), and continuing professional development (CPD). This flexibility indicates that the intervention can be widely adopted and adapted to different educational settings.\n\nFuture directions for evaluation involve designing a study to assess the intervention's effectiveness and implementation. This next step will provide more concrete data on the module's impact on clinicians' counseling skills and patient outcomes. By involving the Black community in the development and evaluation process, the project aims to maximize the relevance and effectiveness of the educational module.",
