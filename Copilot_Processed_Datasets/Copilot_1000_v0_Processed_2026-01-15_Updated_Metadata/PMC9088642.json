  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from electronic medical records. Specifically, individual and neighborhood social determinants of health (SDoH) and cardiometabolic disease staging (CMDS) clinical parameters were extracted. These parameters included body mass index (BMI), glucose levels, blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and triglycerides, collected up to three years prior to a positive COVID-19 test.\n\nThe study identified a total of 2,873 patients. The mean age of the participants was 58 years, with a standard deviation of 13.2 years. Among the participants, 59% were female, and 45% were Black.\n\nThe data used in this study has not been previously published or used by the community in the same context. The unique aspect of this dataset lies in its focus on integrating both clinical markers of cardiometabolic disease and social determinants of health to predict COVID-19 outcomes. This approach aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing health outcomes during the pandemic.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was initially identified with 3,989 patients who had a positive PCR test for COVID-19 and had previous medical encounters with complete clinical data. Patients under 35 years of age were excluded, resulting in an eligible sample of 3,441 patients. Of these, 568 patients were missing one or more social determinants of health (SDoH) measures, leaving 2,873 patients with complete data for analysis. This final group of 2,873 patients was used for the primary analysis.\n\nThe dataset was not explicitly split into multiple training and testing sets in the traditional sense. Instead, the analysis involved using Bayesian logistic regression models with 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate predictive performance. This cross-validation process involved splitting the data into 10 subsets, where the model was trained on 9 subsets and tested on the remaining subset, repeating this process 10 times with different subsets as the test set. This method ensures that each data point is used for both training and testing, providing a robust evaluation of the model's performance.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset used in this study consisted of 3,989 patients with a positive PCR test for COVID-19 and available clinical data from electronic medical records. To ensure a robust analysis, patients under the age of 35 were excluded, resulting in an eligible sample of 3,441 patients. Among these, 568 patients were missing one or more social determinants of health (SDoH) measures, leaving 2,873 patients with complete data for the final analysis.\n\nTo evaluate the predictive performance of the models, a 10-fold cross-validation technique was employed. This method involves splitting the dataset into 10 subsets, or folds, and then iteratively training the model on 9 folds while testing it on the remaining fold. This process is repeated 10 times, with each fold serving as the test set once. This approach ensures that each data point is used for both training and testing, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance.\n\nThe independence of the training and test sets was enforced through the cross-validation process, where the data is randomly shuffled before being split into folds. This randomization helps to ensure that the data in each fold is representative of the overall dataset, reducing the risk of bias and ensuring that the model's performance is generalizable to new, unseen data.\n\nRegarding the distribution of the dataset, it is important to note that the study population had a mean age of 58 years, with 59% being female and 45% being Black. The majority of patients were married (55.4%), and about 40% had public insurance, while 2% had no insurance. In terms of neighborhood SDoH, most patients were from metropolitan areas (93.7%), with 35% living in areas with high social vulnerability and 31.5% residing in Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs).\n\nThe distribution of the dataset compares favorably to previously published machine learning datasets in the context of COVID-19 outcomes. The inclusion of a diverse patient population, with a significant representation of minority groups and individuals from socially vulnerable areas, enhances the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the comprehensive clinical data collected up to 3 years prior to a positive COVID-19 test provides a rich source of information for modeling and prediction.",
  "dataset/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our study is Bayesian logistic regression. This is a well-established class of machine-learning algorithms, specifically within the realm of probabilistic modeling and statistical learning.\n\nThe algorithm used is not new; it has been extensively studied and applied in various fields. Bayesian logistic regression is particularly valued for its ability to incorporate prior knowledge and handle uncertainty in the data. In our work, we utilized weakly informative priors, specifically Cauchy distributions, to stabilize the model fitting and improve prediction performance. This approach aligns with established practices in the field, as outlined by Gelman et al.\n\nThe choice to use Bayesian logistic regression in a health sciences publication, rather than a machine-learning journal, is driven by the specific context and goals of our research. Our primary focus is on understanding the predictive power of cardiometabolic disease (CMDS) parameters and social determinants of health (SDoH) in relation to COVID-19 outcomes. The Bayesian framework allows us to model complex relationships and uncertainties in the data, which is crucial for making reliable predictions in a clinical setting. The algorithm's implementation and evaluation were tailored to address the unique challenges and requirements of our dataset, ensuring that the results are relevant and actionable for healthcare providers and policymakers.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employed in this study does not function as a meta-predictor. Instead, it utilizes Bayesian logistic regression to analyze associations between cardiometabolic disease scores, social determinants of health, and COVID-19 outcomes. The approach involves fitting models with various combinations of individual and neighborhood-level social determinants of health, along with cardiometabolic disease staging components.\n\nThe Bayesian logistic regression models were constructed using weakly informative priors, specifically Cauchy distributions, to stabilize model fitting and enhance prediction performance. The models were fitted sequentially, starting with cardiometabolic disease staging metabolic syndrome traits, then incorporating individual social determinants of health such as marital status and insurance status, and finally including neighborhood social determinants of health like social vulnerability index, rurality, and health professional shortage area status.\n\nThe study did not combine predictions from multiple machine-learning algorithms to create a meta-predictor. Instead, it focused on refining a single Bayesian logistic regression model by progressively adding different sets of predictors. The training data for these models were derived from electronic medical records, ensuring that the data used for model development were independent and not reused across different stages of the analysis.\n\nThe predictive performance of the models was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation, with metrics such as area under the curve, mean squared error, and misclassification rates. This evaluation process ensured that the models were robust and generalizable to new data. The results indicated that adding social determinants of health to the cardiometabolic disease staging model improved the predictive accuracy for hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality outcomes.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the machine-learning algorithm, data encoding and preprocessing involved several key steps. Initially, cardiometabolic disease staging (CMDS) clinical parameters, including blood glucose, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides, were extracted from electronic medical records (EMR). These parameters were collected up to three years prior to a positive COVID-19 test.\n\nIndividual-level social determinants of health (SDoH) such as marital status and insurance status were also encoded. Neighborhood-level SDoH, including social vulnerability index (SVI), rurality, and health professional shortage area (HPSA) status, were integrated into the dataset. These SDoH variables were crucial for understanding the broader context in which patients lived and how it might influence their health outcomes.\n\nBayesian logistic regression was employed to model the relationships between CMDS scores, SDoH, and COVID-19 outcomes. Weakly informative priors, specifically Cauchy distributions with a center of 0 and a scale of 2.5, were assigned to the coefficients in the logistic regressions. This approach helped stabilize the model fitting and improve prediction performance by providing minimal prior information to constrain coefficients within a reasonable range.\n\nThe data was further processed by fitting Bayesian logistic regression models in a stepwise manner. Initially, a model using only CMDS metabolic syndrome traits was fitted. Subsequently, individual SDoH variables were added, followed by neighborhood SDoH variables. This stepwise approach allowed for the evaluation of the incremental predictive value of each set of variables.\n\nTo ensure the robustness of the models, 10-fold cross-validation was used. This technique involved dividing the data into 10 subsets, training the model on 9 subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This process was repeated 10 times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. Performance metrics, including the area under the curve (AUC), mean squared error (MSE), and misclassification rate, were calculated to evaluate the predictive power of the models.\n\nStatistical analysis was performed using R software, version 4.0.3. The model fitting and predictive evaluation were implemented using the `bglm` and `cv.bh` functions in the BhGLM package. This package facilitated the incorporation of an approximate expectation-maximization algorithm into the iteratively weighted least squares used in classical logistic regression, enabling the fitting of Bayesian logistic regression models with Cauchy priors.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the number of parameters used in the model varied depending on the specific model being evaluated. Initially, we fitted a Bayesian logistic regression model using only cardiometabolic disease staging (CMDS) metabolic syndrome traits. This included clinical parameters such as BMI, glucose, blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides.\n\nSubsequently, we expanded the model by adding individual-level social determinants of health (SDoH), specifically marital status and insurance status. Finally, we included neighborhood-level SDoH, which encompassed social vulnerability index (SVI), rurality, and Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) status.\n\nThe selection of these parameters was guided by their known associations with COVID-19 outcomes and their availability in the electronic medical records. The inclusion of both individual and neighborhood-level SDoH was aimed at capturing a comprehensive set of factors that could influence health outcomes beyond just clinical markers.\n\nAdditionally, we ran supplemental models stratified by age and used an insurance variable that distinguished between Medicare and Medicaid recipients to better approximate individual socioeconomic status, given the lack of income and education data in the electronic medical records.\n\nThe model fitting process involved using weakly informative priors, specifically Cauchy distributions with a center of 0 and a scale of 2.5, for the coefficients in the logistic regressions. This approach helped to stabilize the model fitting and improve prediction performance by providing minimal prior information to constrain the coefficients within a reasonable range.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized a combination of cardiometabolic disease (CMDS) clinical parameters and social determinants of health (SDoH) as input features. The CMDS clinical parameters included BMI, glucose levels, blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides. These parameters were collected up to three years prior to a positive COVID-19 test.\n\nIn addition to the CMDS clinical parameters, we incorporated individual-level SDoH such as marital status and insurance status. Neighborhood-level SDoH included social vulnerability index (SVI), rurality, and Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) status.\n\nFeature selection was not explicitly performed as a separate step. Instead, we built our models by progressively adding different sets of features. We first fitted a Bayesian logistic regression model using only the CMDS metabolic syndrome traits. Subsequently, we added individual SDoH and finally included neighborhood SDoH. This approach allowed us to evaluate the incremental value of each set of features in predicting COVID-19 outcomes.\n\nThe models were cross-validated using 10-fold cross-validation to ensure robust performance evaluation. The features used in the final models included all the CMDS clinical parameters and both individual and neighborhood SDoH. This comprehensive set of features enabled us to capture a wide range of factors influencing COVID-19 outcomes, including both biological and social determinants.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The study employed Bayesian logistic regression to model the probability of COVID-19 outcomes using cardiometabolic disease staging (CMDS) components and social determinants of health (SDoH). To address potential overfitting, weakly informative priors were assigned to the coefficients in the logistic regressions. These priors, specifically Cauchy distributions with a center of 0 and a scale of 2.5, provided minimal prior information, constraining coefficients within a reasonable range. This approach stabilized the model fitting process and improved prediction performance.\n\nTo further mitigate overfitting, an approximate expectation-maximization algorithm was incorporated into the iteratively weighted least squares typically used in classical logistic regression. This method ensured that the model was robust and generalizable.\n\nThe models were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation, which is a robust technique for assessing model performance and generalizability. Several measures were used to evaluate predictive performance, including the area under the curve (AUC), mean squared error (MSE), and misclassification rate. These metrics provided a comprehensive assessment of the model's accuracy and reliability.\n\nThe study also included supplemental models stratified by age and those using an insurance variable to parse out recipients of Medicare or Medicaid. These additional models helped to ensure that the findings were consistent across different subgroups and that the model was not underfitting by missing important variations in the data.\n\nOverall, the use of Bayesian logistic regression with weakly informative priors, along with rigorous cross-validation techniques, ensured that the models were neither overfitting nor underfitting the data. This approach provided reliable and generalizable predictions of COVID-19 outcomes based on CMDS and SDoH.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed Bayesian logistic regression with weakly informative priors to prevent overfitting. Specifically, we used Cauchy distributions with a center of 0 and a scale of 2.5 for the coefficients in the logistic regressions. This approach provides minimal prior information, constraining the coefficients within a reasonable range, which helps to stabilize the model fitting and improve prediction performance. Additionally, we utilized an approximate expectation-maximization algorithm incorporated into the iteratively weighted least squares method typically used in classical logistic regression. This technique further aids in preventing overfitting by ensuring that the model generalizes well to new data.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters used in our study are reported within the publication. Specifically, we utilized Bayesian logistic regression with weakly informative priors, specifically Cauchy distributions centered at 0 with a scale of 2.5. These priors were chosen to provide minimal prior information, thereby stabilizing the model fitting and improving prediction performance. The model fitting process incorporated an approximate expectation-maximization algorithm within the iteratively weighted least squares framework typical of classical logistic regression.\n\nThe optimization schedule involved fitting the Bayesian logistic regression models in a stepwise manner. Initially, we fitted a model using only cardiometabolic disease staging (CMDS) metabolic syndrome traits. Subsequently, we added individual-level social determinants of health (SDoH) such as marital status and insurance status. Finally, we included neighborhood-level SDoH, including the social vulnerability index (SVI), rurality, and health professional shortage area (HPSA) status.\n\nThe predictive performance of the models was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation, with metrics including the area under the curve (AUC), mean squared error, and misclassification rates. The statistical analysis was performed using R software, version 4.0.3, with the model fitting and predictive evaluation implemented using the `bglm` and `cv.bh` functions from the BhGLM package, which is available on GitHub under the specified link.\n\nThe model files and specific optimization parameters are not explicitly detailed in the publication, as the focus was on the methodological approach and results. However, the steps and configurations described provide a comprehensive overview of the optimization process and the availability of the tools used. The BhGLM package, which is open-source, can be accessed and utilized by researchers interested in replicating or building upon our work.",
  "model/interpretability": "The models employed in this study are not black-box systems. They utilize Bayesian logistic regression, which inherently provides interpretability through its coefficients. These coefficients represent the log-odds of the outcome for each predictor variable, making it straightforward to understand the direction and magnitude of the relationships between the predictors and the outcomes.\n\nFor instance, the odds ratios (ORs) derived from the models indicate the likelihood of specific COVID-19 outcomes (such as hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality) given changes in the predictor variables. For example, an OR of 2.00 for a one-standard-deviation increase in the CMDS score means that the odds of hospitalization double with each unit increase in the CMDS score. Similarly, an OR of 3.35 for patients with no insurance compared to those with private insurance highlights a significantly higher risk of hospitalization for uninsured individuals.\n\nThe models also incorporate both individual-level and neighborhood-level social determinants of health (SDoH), allowing for a nuanced understanding of how factors like insurance status, social vulnerability, and health care access influence COVID-19 outcomes. This transparency is further enhanced by the use of weakly informative priors, which stabilize the model fitting and improve prediction performance without overly constraining the coefficients.\n\nAdditionally, the study includes stratified models by age group and insurance type, providing further insights into how these variables interact with CMDS and SDoH to predict COVID-19 outcomes. The results are reported as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals, offering a clear and interpretable measure of the associations between the predictors and the outcomes.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in our study is a classification model. Specifically, we utilized Bayesian logistic regression to predict binary COVID-19 outcomes, such as hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality. The model was designed to assess the probability of these outcomes based on various factors, including cardiometabolic disease staging (CMDS) components, individual-level social determinants of health (SDoH), and neighborhood-level SDoH. We evaluated the model's performance using metrics like the area under the curve (AUC), mean squared error (MSE), and misclassification rates. The results indicated that adding SDoH to the CMDS model significantly improved the predictive power, as evidenced by higher AUC values and lower misclassification rates. This suggests that the model is effective in classifying patients into different risk categories for severe COVID-19 outcomes.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "The source code for the models used in this study is not publicly released. However, the model fitting and predictive evaluation were implemented using the R function `bglm` and `cv.bh` in the BhGLM package. This package is available on GitHub at [https://github.com/nyiua b/BhGLM](https://github.com/nyiua b/BhGLM). The BhGLM package provides the necessary tools to replicate the Bayesian logistic regression models and cross-validation procedures described in the study. The specific versions of the software used were R software (version 4.0.3) and the BhGLM package.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method employed in this study involved a comprehensive approach to assess the predictive performance of the models. Bayesian logistic regression models were used to predict COVID-19 outcomes, including hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality. These models incorporated cardiometabolic disease (CMDS) clinical parameters and social determinants of health (SDoH).\n\nTo evaluate the predictive performance, 10-fold cross-validation was utilized. This technique involves dividing the dataset into 10 subsets, training the model on 9 subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated 10 times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. Several measures were used to evaluate the models, including the area under the curve (AUC), mean squared error (MSE), and misclassification rate.\n\nThe AUC is a key metric that indicates the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative outcomes. A higher AUC value signifies better predictive performance. The mean squared error measures the average squared difference between the observed and predicted outcomes, with lower values indicating better model accuracy. The misclassification rate represents the proportion of incorrect predictions made by the model.\n\nThe models were first fitted using only CMDS metabolic syndrome traits. Subsequently, individual SDoH (such as marital status and insurance status) and neighborhood SDoH (including social vulnerability index, rurality, and Health Professional Shortage Area status) were added to assess their impact on predictive performance. The results demonstrated that adding SDoH to the CMDS models significantly improved the AUC for all outcomes, indicating enhanced predictive accuracy.\n\nStatistical analysis was performed using R software, version 4.0.3. The model fitting and predictive evaluation were implemented using the `bglm` and `cv.bh` functions in the BhGLM package. This package facilitates the fitting of Bayesian logistic regression models with Cauchy priors, which help stabilize the model fitting and improve prediction performance. The use of weakly informative priors ensured that the models were not overly constrained by prior information, allowing for more robust and reliable predictions.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our evaluation, we focused on several key performance metrics to assess the predictive power of our models. The primary metric we reported was the area under the curve (AUC), which provides a measure of the model's ability to discriminate between positive and negative outcomes. We also included mean square error (MSE), which quantifies the average squared difference between observed and predicted values, offering insight into the model's accuracy. Additionally, we reported misclassification rates, which indicate the proportion of incorrect predictions made by the model.\n\nThese metrics were chosen to provide a comprehensive view of model performance. The AUC is a widely used metric in the literature for evaluating predictive models, particularly in medical research, as it summarizes the model's performance across all classification thresholds. MSE is another standard metric that helps in understanding the model's predictive accuracy, while misclassification rates are crucial for assessing the practical implications of the model's predictions.\n\nWe evaluated these metrics using 10-fold cross-validation, a robust technique that ensures the model's performance is generalizable to unseen data. This approach helps in mitigating overfitting and provides a reliable estimate of the model's true performance. The results showed that adding social determinants of health (SDoH) to the cardiometabolic disease staging (CMDS) parameters significantly improved the AUC for predicting hospitalization, ICU admittance, and mortality. This indicates that incorporating SDoH enhances the model's discriminative ability and overall predictive performance.\n\nIn summary, the set of metrics we reported is representative of standard practices in the literature and provides a thorough evaluation of our models' performance. The inclusion of AUC, MSE, and misclassification rates, along with cross-validation, ensures that our findings are robust and reliable.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we did not perform a direct comparison to publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. Instead, our focus was on evaluating the predictive performance of our models using cross-validation techniques. We employed 10-fold cross-validation to assess the area under the curve (AUC), mean squared error, and misclassification rates. This approach allowed us to internally validate our models and ensure their robustness.\n\nHowever, we did compare the predictive performance of our models with and without the inclusion of social determinants of health (SDoH). Specifically, we first fitted a Bayesian logistic regression model using only cardiometabolic disease score (CMDS) metabolic syndrome traits. Subsequently, we added individual-level SDoH (such as marital status and insurance status) and neighborhood-level SDoH (such as social vulnerability index, rurality, and health professional shortage area status). This comparative analysis demonstrated that adding SDoH to the CMDS model significantly improved the predictive performance, as evidenced by increased AUC values for hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality outcomes.\n\nAdditionally, we ran supplemental models stratified by age and used an insurance variable that distinguished between Medicare and Medicaid recipients. These stratified models produced similar results, further validating the consistency and reliability of our findings. While we did not compare our methods to simpler baselines explicitly, the incremental improvement observed when adding SDoH suggests that our approach captures important predictive factors that simpler models might overlook.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our models included several performance metrics, such as the area under the curve (AUC), mean squared error (MSE), and misclassification rates. These metrics were used to assess the predictive power of our models.\n\nThe AUC values, which indicate the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative outcomes, were reported with statistical significance. For instance, when predicting hospitalization, the AUC improved from 0.776 to 0.819 when social determinants of health (SDoH) were added to the cardiometabolic disease staging (CMDS) parameters. This improvement was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Similarly, significant improvements in AUC were observed for ICU admission and mortality outcomes.\n\nTo ensure the robustness of our findings, we employed DeLong's test for comparing correlated ROC curves. This test helped us determine that the differences in AUC values between models were statistically significant. For example, models with different combinations of CMDS parameters and SDoH showed significant differences in their predictive performance, as indicated by the superscript letters in Table 2.\n\nAdditionally, we used 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the predictive performance of our models. This technique helps in assessing the model's generalizability and reduces the risk of overfitting. The cross-validation process provided us with reliable estimates of the model's performance metrics, including AUC, MSE, and misclassification rates.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics in our study are accompanied by statistical significance tests, ensuring that the observed improvements in predictive performance are not due to chance. The use of cross-validation further strengthens the confidence in our results, demonstrating the superior predictive power of models that incorporate both CMDS parameters and SDoH.",
