  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from the World Health Organization's COVID-19 Dashboard, which includes vaccination data. Additionally, data was collected from the India COVID-19 website and the Telangana government's COVID-19 portal. The specific data utilized spans from January 1, 2021, to October 31, 2021, and includes confirmed cases from six major districts in India.\n\nThe dataset comprises daily positive COVID-19 cases, which were used to train and test various Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models. The total data was split into two parts: 75% for training and 25% for testing. The first 14 days of data were omitted from the training set to accommodate the 14-day model requirement. This approach ensured that the models had sufficient data to learn patterns and make accurate predictions.\n\nThe dataset's variability and wide range necessitated the use of sophisticated techniques to forecast the COVID-19 epidemic effectively. The districts analyzed include Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), Medchal Malkajgiri, Karimnagar, Khammam, Medchal, and Nalgonda. Each district's data began when the first confirmed cases were recorded, and the daily positive instances showed significant changes, highlighting the need for advanced predictive models.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into two main splits: training data and testing data. The training data constituted 75% of the total dataset, while the testing data made up the remaining 25%. This division was necessary to train the artificial neural network (ANN) models and subsequently evaluate their performance in predicting COVID-19 outbreaks.\n\nThe first 14 days of data were excluded from the training process because the 14-day model requires the previous 14 days' daily positive cases for accurate predictions. This exclusion ensured that all ANN models could be trained effectively. The training data was used to develop the models, and the testing data was used to assess how well these models could predict future COVID-19 outbreaks.\n\nThe immediate results from the ANNs were rounded to integer values using the round function in Excel to ensure practical and interpretable predictions. This rounding was crucial for aligning the model outputs with real-world data, making the predictions more actionable and understandable.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets used in this study were split into two main parts: training data and testing data. The training data constituted 75% of the total dataset, while the testing data made up the remaining 25%. This split was designed to ensure that the models had sufficient data to learn from while also having an independent set to evaluate their performance.\n\nThe independence of the training and test sets was enforced by ensuring that the test data was not used in any way during the training process. This was crucial to avoid any data leakage, which could lead to overoptimistic performance estimates. The first 14 days of data were omitted from the training process because the 14-day model required the previous 14 days' data to make predictions. This omission helped in maintaining the independence of the training and test sets.\n\nThe distribution of the datasets was carefully considered to reflect the variability and range of the COVID-19 outbreak data. The data from six major districts in India were analyzed, with a focus on the daily positive instances. The districts included Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), Medchal Malkajgiri, and Karimnagar, among others. These districts showed significant variability in their data, which necessitated the use of sophisticated techniques to forecast the COVID-19 epidemic accurately.\n\nThe datasets were collected from reliable sources, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the India COVID-19 site. The data covered the period from January 1 to October 31, 2021, and included confirmed cases from the six major districts. This comprehensive data collection ensured that the models were trained on a diverse and representative sample of the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nIn summary, the datasets were split into training and testing sets to ensure independence and avoid data leakage. The distribution of the data reflected the variability and range of the COVID-19 outbreak, making it suitable for training and evaluating sophisticated prediction models.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data supporting the findings of this study are openly available through the #TelanganaFightsCorona initiative by the Government of Telangana. This data can be accessed at the following URL: https://covid19.telangana.gov.in/.\n\nThe dataset includes confirmed COVID-19 cases from six major districts in India, collected from January 1, 2021, to October 31, 2021. The data was split into training and testing sets, with 75% of the data used for training and 25% for testing. This split was enforced to ensure that the models were trained on a sufficient amount of data while also having a separate set for evaluating their predictive performance.\n\nThe data was collected from reliable sources, including the WHO COVID-19 Dashboard and the India COVID-19 site. The availability of this data in a public forum ensures transparency and allows for reproducibility of the study's findings. The data is made available under the terms and conditions specified by the Government of Telangana, which typically include proper citation and non-commercial use.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in this study is artificial neural networks (ANNs), specifically employing the backpropagation technique. This algorithm is not new; it has been widely used and studied in the field of machine learning for several decades. The backpropagation algorithm is a well-established method for training ANNs and has been applied in various domains, including forecasting and classification tasks.\n\nThe choice to use this algorithm in a study focused on COVID-19 prediction rather than in a purely machine-learning journal can be attributed to the specific application and the interdisciplinary nature of the research. The study aims to address a pressing public health issue by leveraging established machine-learning techniques. Publishing in a domain-specific journal allows for a more targeted audience of researchers and practitioners who are directly involved in combating the pandemic. This approach ensures that the findings are immediately relevant and actionable within the context of COVID-19 research and management.",
  "optimization/meta": "The models used in this study are based on Artificial Neural Networks with Backpropagation (ANN-BP). These models do not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, they rely on historical COVID-19 case data to make predictions.\n\nThe study involved developing and comparing multiple ANN-BP models, each with different configurations and training data. The models were evaluated based on their performance in forecasting COVID-19 cases in various districts. The 14-day model, which estimates confirmed cases each day based on records from the previous 14 days, was found to be the most accurate.\n\nThe performance of these models was assessed using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The results showed that the 14-day model consistently outperformed the others, particularly in regions that had experienced the first peak of the pandemic. This suggests that the model's ability to capture the trend of the outbreak in the training data is crucial for its predictive accuracy.\n\nThe study also highlighted the importance of using multiple metrics to evaluate the performance of forecast models. While the 14-day model showed the best overall performance, the ranking of models varied across different districts. This indicates that the choice of the best model may depend on the specific characteristics of the region being studied.\n\nIn summary, the ANN-BP models used in this study are standalone predictors that do not rely on data from other machine-learning algorithms. The 14-day model was identified as the most accurate for forecasting COVID-19 cases, particularly in regions that have experienced the first peak of the pandemic. The study underscores the importance of using multiple evaluation metrics and considering regional differences when selecting the best forecast model.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure the data was suitable for training and testing the artificial neural networks (ANNs). The data collected consisted of daily positive COVID-19 cases from various districts in India, specifically from the WHO and local government sources. The data was gathered from January 1 to October 31, 2021.\n\nInitially, the data was split into two main parts: training data (75%) and testing data (25%). The training data was used to train the ANN models, while the testing data was used to evaluate the performance of these models in predicting COVID-19 outbreaks. The first 14 days of data were excluded from the training process because the models required the previous 14 days' data to make predictions.\n\nDescriptive analysis of the collected data was performed using Excel, which provided powerful tools for data investigation and executing statistical methods. This analysis helped in understanding the range and variability of the data, which was crucial for selecting appropriate ANN models.\n\nThe ANN models used in this study had specific architectures. For instance, the 14th ANN technique had 14 neurons in the input layer, 10 neurons in the hidden layer, and 1 neuron in the output layer. This architecture was designed to handle the 14-day input data required for making predictions.\n\nPreprocessing steps included normalizing the data to eliminate the mean and de-correlate the data, which helped in improving the performance of the ANN models. Additionally, the input data was rounded up to integer values using the round function in Excel to ensure the predictions were in whole numbers, which is practical for counting daily cases.\n\nThe data encoding involved transforming the raw data into a format suitable for the ANN models. This included converting the daily positive cases into a numerical format that the ANN could process. The models were then trained using the backpropagation algorithm, which involved initializing weights, feeding forward the input data, calculating the output error, and updating the weights to minimize the error.\n\nIn summary, the data encoding and preprocessing involved collecting and splitting the data, performing descriptive analysis, normalizing the data, and transforming it into a suitable format for the ANN models. These steps were essential for training the models to accurately predict COVID-19 outbreaks.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized 14 different artificial neural network-based models to predict the COVID-19 outbreak. Each model incorporates a distinct set of parameters, ranging from a single parameter in the first model to 14 parameters in the fourteenth model. The parameters used in these models are based on the daily confirmed cases from previous days, with each model considering a different number of preceding days.\n\nThe selection of the number of parameters (p) for each model was guided by the goal of assessing the impact of incorporating varying lengths of historical data on the predictive accuracy of the models. By systematically increasing the number of parameters from 1 to 14, we aimed to determine the optimal window of past data that yields the most accurate forecasts. This approach allowed us to evaluate the trade-off between model complexity and predictive performance, ensuring that the chosen models were both robust and efficient in estimating daily confirmed COVID-19 cases.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized 14 features as input for our Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models. These features represent the daily positive COVID-19 cases over a 14-day period. The selection of these features was based on the requirement of our models to predict future outbreaks using historical data.\n\nFeature selection was performed to ensure that the most relevant data was used for training our models. This process involved identifying the key patterns and trends in the daily positive cases that could help in accurately predicting future outbreaks. The feature selection was conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the test set remained unbiased and could be used to evaluate the performance of our models.\n\nThe use of these 14 features allowed our ANN models to capture the temporal dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak, enabling them to make more accurate predictions. The models were trained on 75% of the data, with the remaining 25% used for testing, ensuring a robust evaluation of their predictive capabilities.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed artificial neural networks (ANNs) with a backpropagation algorithm to predict COVID-19 cases. The ANNs used in this research have a specific architecture consisting of 14 neurons in the input layer, 10 neurons in the hidden layer, and 1 neuron in the output layer. This architecture was chosen to capture the complexity of the data while avoiding an excessively large number of parameters relative to the training points.\n\nTo address the potential issue of overfitting, we implemented several strategies. Firstly, we split the data into training (75%) and testing (25%) sets. This ensured that the model's performance could be evaluated on unseen data, providing a more reliable measure of its generalization capability. Secondly, we used a relatively simple network architecture with a limited number of neurons in the hidden layer, which helps in reducing the risk of overfitting. Additionally, the use of the backpropagation algorithm with appropriate learning rates and activation functions helped in controlling the model's complexity.\n\nUnderfitting was mitigated by ensuring that the model had sufficient capacity to learn the underlying patterns in the data. The choice of 14 neurons in the input layer, corresponding to the previous 14 days' data, allowed the model to capture temporal dependencies effectively. The hidden layer with 10 neurons provided enough flexibility for the model to learn complex relationships without being too simplistic. Furthermore, the use of the backpropagation algorithm, which systematically adjusts the weights to minimize the error, ensured that the model could converge to an optimal solution.\n\nIn summary, the architecture and training procedures were designed to balance the risk of overfitting and underfitting, ensuring that the model could generalize well to new data while capturing the essential patterns in the COVID-19 outbreak data.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting when developing our artificial neural network (ANN) models for predicting COVID-19 cases. One of the primary methods used was data splitting. The dataset was divided into training and testing sets, with 75% of the data used for training and 25% reserved for testing. This ensured that the models were evaluated on unseen data, which helps in assessing their generalization capability.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized a round function to convert the immediate results of the ANNs to integer values. This step was crucial in aligning the model's predictions with the actual count of daily positive cases, which are whole numbers.\n\nThe ANN models themselves were designed with a specific architecture that included input, hidden, and output layers. The input layer had 14 neurons, the hidden layer had 10 neurons, and the output layer had 1 neuron. This architecture was chosen to balance the complexity of the model with its ability to generalize from the training data.\n\nFurthermore, we proposed and tested 14 different ANN methods, each with its unique approach to estimating daily positive cases. By comparing the performance of these models, we could identify which ones were most effective at generalizing to new data, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting.\n\nIn summary, our approach to preventing overfitting involved careful data splitting, appropriate model architecture, and the evaluation of multiple ANN methods to ensure robust and generalizable predictions.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations, optimization schedule, model files, and optimization parameters used in our study are not explicitly detailed in the publication. However, the data supporting the findings of this study are openly available through the #TelanganaFightsCorona initiative by the Government of Telangana. This data can be accessed at the provided URL. The study utilized artificial neural network models with backpropagation (ANN-BP) techniques to forecast daily confirmed cases of COVID-19. The models were evaluated using two dimensionless measures: Mean Square Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE). These metrics were used to assess the performance of the models across six major districts in India. The 14-day model, which estimates confirmed cases based on records from the previous 14 days, was found to be the most effective in making accurate forecasts. This model is recommended for predicting daily confirmed cases of COVID-19, particularly in regions that have experienced the first peak of the pandemic. The study also highlights the importance of using multiple metrics to evaluate the accuracy of forecast results, as relying on a single metric may not provide a comprehensive view of the outcomes.",
  "model/interpretability": "The models we developed, particularly the ANN-BP models, are primarily black-box models. This means that while they are highly effective in predicting COVID-19 cases, the internal workings and the specific reasons behind their predictions are not easily interpretable. The artificial neural network (ANN) with backpropagation (BP) techniques used in our models learn complex patterns from the data, but the decision-making process within these networks is not straightforward to decipher.\n\nThe transparency of our models is limited due to the nature of neural networks, which involve multiple layers and nodes that process information in a way that is not directly observable. However, the performance of these models can be evaluated using dimensionless measures such as Mean Square Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE). These metrics provide a quantitative assessment of how well the models are performing in terms of accuracy and reliability.\n\nFor example, the 14-day model, which estimates confirmed cases based on records from the previous 14 days, has shown the best forecasting performance. This model's success can be attributed to its ability to incorporate the incubation period into the forecast, which is crucial for accurate predictions. The ranking of different models in various districts further supports the effectiveness of the 14-day model, as it consistently outperforms other models in most regions.\n\nWhile the internal mechanisms of our models are not transparent, the results and their implications are clear. The models provide valuable insights into the trends and patterns of the COVID-19 pandemic, which can be used to inform public health strategies and interventions. The use of these models in predicting daily confirmed cases, especially in regions that have experienced the first peak of the pandemic, demonstrates their practical utility and reliability.",
  "model/output": "The model presented in this publication is a regression model. It is designed to predict the number of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases. The model utilizes artificial neural networks (ANN) with Beesham's prediction (BP) techniques, specifically tailored for time-series forecasting. The ANN-BP models estimate confirmed cases based on historical data from previous days, with the 14-day model demonstrating the best performance in forecasting daily confirmed cases. This model is particularly recommended for regions that have experienced the initial peak of the pandemic. The effectiveness of the model is supported by its ability to incorporate the incubation period into the forecast, which has been shown to improve the accuracy of predictions. The model's performance was evaluated across various districts, with the 14-day model consistently ranking highest in predictive accuracy.",

  "evaluation/method": "In our study, we evaluated the performance of 14 different Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models designed to predict the COVID-19 outbreak. The evaluation was conducted using two dimensionless measures: Mean Square Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE). These metrics were chosen to assess the accuracy of the models in predicting daily positive instances of COVID-19.\n\nThe MSE and MAPE were calculated using the known and estimated values of daily positive instances. The formulas for MSE and MAPE are as follows:\n\nMSE = 1/N * \u03a3(yi, known - yi, estimated)^2\n\nMAPE = 1/N * \u03a3|(yi, known - yi, estimated) / yi, known| * 100\n\nWhere yi, known and yi, estimated are the known and estimated values of daily positive instances, respectively, and N is the total number of data points.\n\nThe data used for evaluation was split into two parts: 75% for training the ANN models and 25% for testing their predictive performance. The testing data was used to calculate the MSE and MAPE values, which provided insights into how well each model performed in predicting the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nAdditionally, we compared the performance of the models across six major districts in India. The results showed that the models performed better in districts with a higher range of data and significant variability, such as Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), Medchal Malkajigiri, and Karimnagar. This indicates that the models are more effective in regions with a larger and more diverse dataset.\n\nOverall, the evaluation method involved using MSE and MAPE to assess the predictive accuracy of the ANN models and comparing their performance across different districts. This approach allowed us to identify the most effective models for predicting the COVID-19 outbreak and understand their limitations in different contexts.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our evaluation of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models for predicting COVID-19 cases, we employed two dimensionless performance metrics: Mean Square Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE). These metrics are widely recognized in the literature for assessing the accuracy of predictive models.\n\nMSE measures the average of the squares of the errors\u2014that is, the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual values. It is particularly useful for penalizing larger errors more heavily due to the squaring of the differences. The formula for MSE is:\n\nMSE = 1/N * \u03a3(yi, known - yi, estimated)^2\n\nwhere yi, known and yi, estimated are the known and estimated values of daily positive instances, respectively, and N is the total number of data points.\n\nMAPE, on the other hand, represents the average absolute percent error between the estimated and actual values. It provides a percentage measure of the prediction accuracy, making it easier to interpret. The formula for MAPE is:\n\nMAPE = 1/N * \u03a3|(yi, known - yi, estimated) / yi, known| * 100\n\nBoth MSE and MAPE are crucial for evaluating the performance of our models. While MSE gives a sense of the magnitude of the errors, MAPE offers a relative measure of the prediction accuracy, which is particularly useful for understanding the model's performance in different regions with varying numbers of cases.\n\nThe use of these metrics aligns with established practices in the field, ensuring that our evaluation is both comprehensive and comparable to other studies. By considering both MSE and MAPE, we aim to provide a balanced view of the model's performance, highlighting its strengths and areas for improvement. This dual-metric approach helps in making more informed decisions, especially in the context of public health where accurate predictions are vital.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we compared the performance of our proposed Artificial Neural Network with Backpropagation (ANN-BP) models against simpler mathematical models to evaluate their effectiveness in predicting COVID-19 outbreaks. Specifically, we compared our ANN-BP models with a Boltzmann function-based model and Beesham's prediction model. These comparisons were conducted using data from six different regions in India, which were selected to represent a variety of COVID-19 case loads and infection durations.\n\nThe data from these regions were divided into training and test sets. The training data were used to train the ANN models, while the test data were used to evaluate the models' predictive accuracy. The performance of the models was assessed using two dimensionless measures: Mean Square Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE). These metrics provided a quantitative way to compare the predictive accuracy of the ANN-BP models against the simpler mathematical models.\n\nThe results indicated that the ANN-BP models generally outperformed the simpler mathematical models, particularly in short-term forecasts ranging from 2 to 14 days. This suggests that ANN-BP models are more effective for short-term predictions, which are crucial for healthcare decision-makers in managing the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAdditionally, the study highlighted the importance of using multiple evaluation metrics to assess the performance of predictive models. While the ANN-BP models showed varying levels of accuracy across different regions, the use of both MSE and MAPE provided a more comprehensive view of their predictive capabilities. This approach ensures that the models are robust and reliable for different scenarios and regions.\n\nIn summary, our comparison with simpler baselines demonstrated the superior performance of ANN-BP models in predicting COVID-19 outbreaks, particularly for short-term forecasts. This comparison underscores the value of advanced machine learning techniques in public health management and decision-making.",
