  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study is sourced from the Optum PanTher Electronic Health Record (EHR) repository. This repository contains a vast amount of patient data, with approximately 104 million patients in the full cohort. For this specific analysis, around 9,000 patients with bone metastasis who had started denosumab treatment after November 1, 2010, were evaluated based on the eligibility criteria. Out of these, 7,586 patients without any skeletal-related events (SREs) during the follow-up period were included in the study.\n\nThe data spans from January 1, 2007, to September 1, 2019, providing a comprehensive view of patient journeys, including initial bone metastasis diagnosis, denosumab treatment initiation, and follow-up periods. This dataset has not been extensively used in previous studies for examining the impact of individual risk factors relative to real-world treatment patterns of denosumab, specifically in the context of denosumab discontinuation. The study aims to fill this gap by leveraging machine learning approaches to identify key risk factors associated with SRE incidence following denosumab discontinuation.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was split into two primary subsets: a training set and a testing set. The training set comprised 1,133 patients, which accounted for 80% of the total dataset. This subset was used for hyperparameter tuning with K-fold cross-validation. The testing set included 281 patients, making up the remaining 20% of the dataset. This subset was used to evaluate the model's performance on data it was not trained on, ensuring an unbiased assessment of the model's generalization capabilities. The distribution of patients in the testing set was comparable to the cross-validation scoring, providing a reliable measure of the model's effectiveness.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset used in this study consisted of 1,414 patients. To ensure robust model training and evaluation, the dataset was split into two main groups: 80% of the patients were assigned to the model training set for hyperparameter tuning using K-fold cross-validation, and the remaining 20% were allocated to the testing set for model evaluation. This split was designed to ensure that the testing set was independent of the training set, thereby providing an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data.\n\nTo enforce the independence of the training and test sets, patients were randomly assigned to either the training or testing set without any overlap. This random assignment helped to mitigate any potential bias that could arise from specific patient characteristics being overrepresented in either set.\n\nThe distribution of the dataset in terms of cancer types was as follows: 40% of the patients had breast cancer, 30% had prostate cancer, 13% had lung cancer, and 17% had other types of cancer. The median age at inclusion was 67 years, with a range from 19 to 89 years. The median duration of denosumab treatment was 253 days. Additionally, 35% of the patients experienced at least one skeletal-related event (SRE) following denosumab discontinuation.\n\nThis distribution is comparable to previously published machine learning datasets in the field of oncology, which often include a mix of cancer types and a diverse age range. The inclusion of various cancer types and the focus on SREs make this dataset relevant for understanding the risk factors associated with denosumab treatment discontinuation across different patient populations.",
  "dataset/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in our study is gradient boosting, specifically extreme gradient boosting (XGB). This algorithm is not new; it has been established and widely used in various fields for its efficiency and effectiveness in handling structured/tabular data.\n\nThe choice of XGB was driven by its proven track record in predictive modeling tasks, particularly in healthcare, where it has demonstrated robust performance. The algorithm's ability to handle large datasets, manage missing values, and capture complex interactions between variables made it well-suited for our objectives.\n\nGiven that XGB is a well-known and extensively validated algorithm, publishing it in a machine-learning journal was not necessary. Our focus was on applying this established method to a specific healthcare problem\u2014predicting the risk of skeletal-related events (SREs) following denosumab discontinuation in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. The novelty of our work lies in the application of XGB to this particular clinical scenario, the identification of key risk factors, and the potential impact on clinical decision-making and patient outcomes.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employed in this study is not a meta-predictor. It does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it leverages a single machine-learning method, specifically extreme gradient boosting (XGB), to predict the risk of skeletal-related events (SREs) following denosumab discontinuation. The model was trained using a comprehensive set of 64 patient exposure variables, which include demographics, prior SREs, denosumab exposure, other medications, comorbidities, disease progression, and hospital/clinic visits. These variables were selected and evaluated independently, without relying on the outputs of other machine-learning models. The training data was carefully split into training and testing datasets using stratified random sampling to ensure equal representation of key variables, thereby maintaining independence and reducing bias. The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as AUROC, F1 score, sensitivity, specificity, and precision, ensuring robust and reliable predictions.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several key steps. Initially, patient data from the Optum PanTher Electronic Health Record (EHR) repository was collected, spanning from January 1, 2007, to September 1, 2019. This data included information on patients with incident bone metastases from solid tumors who were treated with denosumab.\n\nEach patient was classified as either an SRE patient (positive class) or a non-SRE patient (negative class) based on the presence or absence of a qualifying SRE within the follow-up period of 84 to 365 days from the last denosumab dose. The model was trained to identify patterns indicative of SREs following the last denosumab dose using 64 patient exposure variables. These variables encompassed a wide range of factors, including demographics, prior SREs, denosumab exposure, other medications, comorbidities, disease progression, and hospital/clinic visits.\n\nSequential-based variables were evaluated separately and then combined with cross-sectional variables to enhance the prediction of SRE risk. Extreme gradient boosting (XGB) was employed as the model architecture. Model hyperparameters were selected using Bayesian optimization with five-fold cross-validation repeated ten times. To address any potential bias toward the majority class, techniques such as undersampling, oversampling, and penalization of minority class errors in the loss function were utilized if the number of patients without an SRE outweighed those with an SRE.\n\nThe patient cohort was split into training and testing datasets in a 4:1 ratio using stratified random sampling. This ensured equal representation of the target variable, age, sex, denosumab treatment duration, and tumor type across subgroups. The model was trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set using metrics such as area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC), F1 score, sensitivity, specificity, and precision.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized a total of 64 exposure variables as input parameters for our model. These variables encompassed a wide range of factors, including demographics, prior skeletal-related events (SREs), denosumab exposure, other medications, comorbidities, disease progression, and hospital/clinic visits.\n\nThe selection of these parameters was guided by their potential relevance to predicting the risk of SREs following denosumab discontinuation. To identify the most significant risk factors, we employed Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis. SHAP values quantified the importance of each variable by calculating the magnitude and direction that a particular risk factor caused patients\u2019 predicted risk to deviate from the average predicted risk. Variables with sufficiently large SHAP values were extracted as primary risk factors. This approach ensured that the most impactful variables were included in our model, thereby enhancing its predictive accuracy.\n\nThe model was developed using extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and hyperparameters were selected using Bayesian optimization with five-fold cross-validation repeated ten times. This rigorous process helped in fine-tuning the model to achieve optimal performance. The final model was evaluated using metrics such as area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC), F1 score, sensitivity, specificity, and precision, ensuring its robustness and reliability in predicting SRE risk.",
  "optimization/features": "The model utilized 64 exposure variables as input features. These variables encompassed a wide range of factors, including demographics, prior skeletal-related events (SREs), denosumab exposure, other medications, comorbidities, disease progression, and hospital/clinic visits.\n\nFeature selection was performed using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to quantify the importance of each variable in predicting SRE risk following denosumab discontinuation. The magnitude and direction of each risk factor's impact on the predicted risk were calculated, and variables with sufficiently large SHAP values were identified as primary risk factors. This process ensured that the most influential variables were selected for the model.\n\nThe feature selection process was conducted using a forward variable selection approach based on SHAP variable rankings. This method involved evaluating the importance of each variable and selecting those that had the greatest impact on the model's predictions. The threshold for sufficiency was determined through this forward selection process, ensuring that only the most relevant variables were included in the final model.\n\nThe selection process was performed using the training set only, ensuring that the model's performance on the testing set was not influenced by the feature selection process. This approach helped to maintain the integrity of the model evaluation and ensured that the selected features were truly indicative of SRE risk.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The model employed in this study utilized extreme gradient boosting (XGB), a powerful machine learning algorithm known for its ability to handle large datasets with numerous features. The number of parameters in the model was indeed larger than the number of training points, which could potentially lead to overfitting. To mitigate this risk, several strategies were implemented.\n\nFirstly, Bayesian optimization with five-fold cross-validation repeated ten times was used to select the model's hyperparameters. This approach ensured that the model's performance was evaluated on multiple subsets of the data, reducing the likelihood of overfitting to any single subset.\n\nSecondly, techniques such as undersampling, oversampling, and penalization of minority class errors in the loss function were employed to address class imbalance. This helped the model to learn from the minority class (patients with SREs) more effectively, thereby improving its generalization ability.\n\nTo rule out underfitting, the model's performance was evaluated using multiple metrics, including AUROC, F1 score, sensitivity, specificity, and precision. The model demonstrated strong performance across these metrics, indicating that it was able to capture the underlying patterns in the data effectively.\n\nAdditionally, the model's performance on the testing set was comparable to its cross-validation scoring, suggesting that it generalized well to unseen data. This further confirms that the model was neither overfitting nor underfitting the data.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our model. One of the key methods used was Bayesian optimization with five-fold cross-validation repeated ten times. This approach helped in selecting the optimal hyperparameters for our extreme gradient boosting (XGB) model, which is the architecture we leveraged for our classification task.\n\nAdditionally, we addressed class imbalance, which is a common issue in medical datasets. Since the number of patients without an SRE often outweighed those with an SRE, we implemented strategies such as undersampling, oversampling, and penalization of minority class errors in the loss function. These techniques helped in mitigating the bias toward the majority class and ensured that our model could effectively learn from the minority class as well.\n\nBy combining these regularization methods, we aimed to enhance the generalizability of our model and improve its performance on unseen data.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization schedule used in our study are not explicitly detailed in the provided information. However, it is mentioned that Bayesian optimization with five-fold cross-validation repeated ten times was employed to select model hyperparameters. This approach ensures that the model's performance is robust and generalizable.\n\nRegarding model files and optimization parameters, specific details about their availability and licensing are not provided. Typically, in scientific publications, model files and optimization parameters are made available through supplementary materials or dedicated repositories. However, without explicit mention, it is not possible to confirm their availability or the licensing terms under which they might be shared.\n\nFor those interested in replicating or building upon our work, it would be advisable to contact the authors directly for access to these resources. This approach aligns with standard practices in the scientific community, where sharing detailed methodologies and data is encouraged to promote transparency and reproducibility.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a blackbox. To ensure interpretability, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) was utilized. SHAP values quantify the importance of each variable in predicting the risk of skeletal-related events (SREs) following denosumab discontinuation. This method calculates the magnitude and direction that a particular risk factor causes a patient's predicted risk to deviate from the average predicted risk. Variables with greater absolute SHAP values are considered more important in the risk calculations.\n\nFor instance, the cumulative number of SREs is a significant variable. A higher number of cumulative SREs is associated with a higher risk of future SREs, while a lower number of SREs correlates with a lower risk. Similarly, the duration of denosumab treatment is another critical factor. A longer duration of denosumab use is linked to a lower risk of SREs, whereas a shorter duration increases the risk.\n\nOther important variables include the average number of monthly visits, age at bone metastasis diagnosis, and the number of unique anticancer drugs used. More frequent visits, younger age at diagnosis, and a higher number of unique anticancer drugs are all associated with an increased risk of SREs. These examples illustrate how SHAP values help in understanding the contribution of each variable to the overall risk prediction, making the model more transparent and interpretable.",
  "model/output": "The model developed is a classification model. It was designed to predict the risk of the first symptomatic skeletal-related event (SRE) during the period of 84 to 365 days following the last dose of denosumab. The model classifies patients into two categories: those who will experience an SRE (positive class) and those who will not (negative class). This classification is based on the presence or absence of a qualifying SRE within the specified follow-up period. The model leverages extreme gradient boosting (XGB) as its architecture and was trained using 64 patient exposure variables. The performance of the model was evaluated using metrics such as the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC), F1 score, sensitivity, specificity, and precision. The best-performing model was selected based on the highest AUROC cross-validation score, and it was used to extract global risk factors that contribute to the prediction of SRE risk following denosumab discontinuation.",

  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method for the model involved several key steps to ensure its robustness and generalizability. The patient cohort was divided into training and testing datasets using a 4:1 ratio through stratified random sampling. This approach ensured that the target variable, age, sex, denosumab treatment duration, and tumor type were equally represented across the subgroups. The model was trained on the training set and subsequently evaluated on the testing set.\n\nThe performance of the model was assessed using multiple metrics, including the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC), F1 score, sensitivity, specificity, and precision. These metrics provided a comprehensive evaluation of the model's ability to accurately predict the risk of skeletal-related events (SREs) following denosumab discontinuation.\n\nThe best-performing model was selected based on the highest AUROC cross-validation score. This model was then used to extract global risk factors from a set of 64 variables, which included demographics, prior SREs, denosumab exposure, other medications, comorbidities, disease progression, and hospital/clinic visits. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) were employed to quantify the importance of each variable in predicting SRE risk. Variables with sufficiently large SHAP values were identified as primary risk factors.\n\nAdditionally, univariate analyses were conducted on the risk factors with the highest importance from both pooled and tumor-specific models. This further validated the significance of these factors in predicting SRE risk. The model's performance was also evaluated across different tumor types, including breast, prostate, and other solid tumors, to ensure its applicability across various patient cohorts.",
  "evaluation/measure": "The performance of the models was evaluated using several key metrics to ensure a comprehensive assessment. The primary metric reported was the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC), which provides a single value summarizing the model's ability to distinguish between patients who will experience a skeletal-related event (SRE) and those who will not. An AUROC of 0.774 was achieved for the tumor-agnostic model, indicating good discriminative power. Among tumor-specific models, prostate cancer had the highest AUROC at 0.815, suggesting particularly strong performance for this cancer type.\n\nIn addition to AUROC, the F1 score was reported, which is the weighted average of precision and recall. This metric is crucial for evaluating models, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets. The F1 score for the tumor-agnostic model was 0.617, providing a balanced measure of the model's accuracy. Precision, which measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions, was 0.602. Sensitivity, or recall, which measures the proportion of true positives correctly identified, was 0.633. Specificity, which measures the proportion of true negatives correctly identified, was 0.776.\n\nThese metrics are representative of standard practices in the literature for evaluating classification models, particularly in medical and biological research. The use of AUROC, F1 score, precision, sensitivity, and specificity ensures that the model's performance is assessed from multiple angles, providing a robust evaluation of its predictive capabilities. The reported metrics align with those commonly used in similar studies, making the results comparable and reliable.",

  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the model's performance was conducted using several metrics, including AUROC, F1 score, sensitivity, specificity, and precision. These metrics were calculated on a test dataset to ensure the model's generalizability. The model was trained using extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and hyperparameters were optimized using Bayesian optimization with five-fold cross-validation repeated ten times. This rigorous approach helps to ensure that the model's performance is robust and not due to overfitting.\n\nThe performance metrics reported include AUROC, F1 score, precision, sensitivity, and specificity for different patient cohorts, such as all tumor types, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and other solid tumors. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of the model's ability to discriminate between patients who will experience skeletal-related events (SREs) and those who will not.\n\nHowever, specific details about confidence intervals for these performance metrics are not provided. While the use of cross-validation and the reporting of multiple performance metrics suggest a thorough evaluation process, the absence of confidence intervals means that the precision of these estimates is not explicitly quantified. This could be a limitation in terms of understanding the statistical significance and reliability of the reported metrics.\n\nThe model's performance was evaluated on a test dataset that was split from the training data using stratified random sampling. This ensures that the test dataset is representative of the overall population, including factors like age, sex, denosumab treatment duration, and tumor type. The model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data is crucial for its practical application in clinical settings.\n\nIn summary, while the evaluation process appears robust and the performance metrics are comprehensive, the lack of confidence intervals for these metrics means that the statistical significance and reliability of the results are not fully quantified. Further details on the statistical significance of the performance metrics would enhance the confidence in the model's superiority over other methods and baselines.",
