  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our study is a random forest regression model. This is a well-established machine-learning algorithm class known for its ability to capture nonlinear relationships and handle complex datasets effectively.\n\nThe random forest regression model used in this study is not a new algorithm. It is a widely recognized and extensively used technique in the field of machine learning and statistics. The choice of this algorithm was driven by its robustness and proven effectiveness in similar predictive modeling tasks.\n\nThe decision to use a random forest regression model was based on its suitability for the specific problem at hand\u2014predicting the severity risk of futile recanalization after endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke. The algorithm's ability to handle a multitude of predictor variables and its capacity to provide feature importance scores made it an ideal choice for our study.\n\nGiven that the random forest regression model is a mature and widely accepted algorithm, it was not necessary to publish it in a machine-learning journal. Instead, the focus of our publication is on the application of this algorithm to a specific medical problem, highlighting its utility in improving treatment planning and patient management for acute ischemic stroke.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employed in this study is not a meta-predictor. It does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it relies on a subset of predictor variables selected based on clinical relevance and statistical significance. The primary machine-learning method used is a random forest regression model. This model was chosen for its ability to capture nonlinear relationships effectively.\n\nThe random forest model was trained using cross-validation with five folds to assess its generalizability and fit to the data. The predictor variables included in the final model are age, sex, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, cognitive impairment, pre-stroke modified Rankin Scale score, systolic blood pressure, onset-to-puncture time, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, and NIHSS score. These variables were determined to have the most significant impact on the prediction of the Futile Recanalization Prediction Score (FRPS).\n\nThe training data for the random forest model was carefully selected to ensure independence. This involved rigorous data processing and evaluation steps, including meta-regression and sensitivity analysis, to validate the model's performance and reliability. The model achieved a mean R-squared value of approximately 0.992, indicating a strong relationship between the predictor variables and FRPS scores. This high level of accuracy suggests that the model is robust and can be applied in clinical settings to predict the severity risk of futile recanalization after endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, the data encoding and preprocessing were meticulously designed to ensure the robustness and accuracy of our machine-learning algorithm. We began by selecting a subset of predictor variables based on their clinical relevance and statistical significance. These variables included age, sex, atrial fibrillation (AF), hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia, cognitive impairment, pre-stroke modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score, systolic blood pressure (SBP), onset-to-puncture time, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score.\n\nAge was encoded as a continuous variable representing the patient's age. Sex was encoded as a binary variable, with male represented by 0 and female by 1. Conditions such as AF, HTN, DM, hyperlipidemia, cognitive impairment, and sICH were also encoded as binary variables, where 1 indicated the presence of the condition and 0 indicated its absence. The pre-stroke mRS score was included as a continuous variable representing the patient's functional status before the stroke. SBP was encoded as a continuous variable reflecting the patient's systolic blood pressure. The onset-to-puncture time, which is the interval from stroke onset to puncture during endovascular thrombectomy, was also encoded as a continuous variable. The NIHSS score, a measure of stroke severity, was included as a continuous variable.\n\nTo enhance the model's performance, we employed a random forest regression algorithm, which is particularly effective at capturing nonlinear relationships among the predictor variables. This algorithm automatically determines the coefficients during the training process, allowing us to focus on the relative importance of each variable rather than explicit coefficients. We used cross-validation with five folds to assess the model's generalizability and fit to the data, ensuring that our predictions were reliable and robust. The final model achieved a mean R-squared value of approximately 0.992, indicating a strong relationship between the predictor variables and the Futile Recanalization Prediction Score (FRPS). This rigorous approach to data encoding and preprocessing was crucial in developing a reliable and accurate predictive model for futile recanalization after endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In the optimization of our model, we utilized a total of 12 input parameters. These parameters were carefully selected based on their clinical relevance and potential impact on the Futile Recanalization Prediction Score (FRPS). The selection process involved evaluating various predictor variables to ensure that only the most significant ones were included. This approach helped in capturing nonlinear relationships and enhancing the model's performance. The parameters considered include age, sex, presence of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, cognitive impairment, pre-stroke modified Rankin Scale score, systolic blood pressure, onset-to-puncture time, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score. Each of these variables was chosen for its known association with outcomes in acute ischemic stroke and its potential to influence the FRPS.",
  "optimization/features": "In the optimization process of our model, we utilized a total of 12 features as input variables. These features were carefully selected based on their clinical relevance and potential impact on the Futile Recanalization Prediction Score (FRPS). The selected features include age, sex, atrial fibrillation (AF), hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia, cognitive impairment, pre-stroke modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score, systolic blood pressure (SBP), onset-to-puncture time, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH), and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score.\n\nFeature selection was indeed performed to ensure that only the most significant and clinically relevant variables were included in the final model. This process involved evaluating a subset of predictor variables based on both clinical relevance and statistical significance. The selection was conducted using the training set only, adhering to best practices in machine learning to prevent data leakage and ensure the model's generalizability. By focusing on these key features, we aimed to capture the most important factors influencing the risk of futile recanalization, thereby enhancing the model's predictive accuracy and clinical utility.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed for the Futile Recanalization Prediction Score (FRPS) utilized a random forest regression model, which is well-suited for handling complex, nonlinear relationships within the data. This approach inherently manages a large number of parameters, as random forests can include numerous decision trees, each contributing to the final prediction.\n\nTo address the potential issue of overfitting, cross-validation with five folds was implemented. This technique ensures that the model's performance is evaluated across different subsets of the data, providing a robust assessment of its generalizability. The mean R-squared value achieved was approximately 0.992, indicating a strong fit between the predictor variables and the FRPS scores. This high value suggests that the model captures the underlying patterns in the data effectively without overfitting.\n\nUnderfitting was mitigated by selecting clinically relevant variables and employing a machine learning algorithm capable of capturing nonlinear relationships. The initial exploration of linear regression models revealed negative R-squared values, prompting the shift to nonlinear regression techniques. The random forest model's ability to handle interactions between variables and its feature importance extraction further ensured that the model was not too simplistic.\n\nAdditionally, the model's performance was assessed using statistical measures like R-squared and cross-validation, which helped in fine-tuning the model to avoid both overfitting and underfitting. The final equation for the FRPS model includes variables such as age, sex, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, cognitive impairment, pre-stroke modified Rankin Scale, systolic blood pressure, onset-to-puncture time, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and NIHSS score. These variables were chosen based on their clinical relevance and statistical significance, ensuring that the model is both comprehensive and efficient.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In the development of the Futile Recanalization Prediction Score (FRPS), several techniques were employed to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of the model. One of the primary methods used was cross-validation. Specifically, five-fold cross-validation was implemented to assess the model's generalizability and fit to the data. This technique involves dividing the dataset into five subsets, training the model on four of these subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated five times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. The mean R-squared value across all folds was computed to evaluate the model's performance, resulting in a strong relationship between the predictor variables and the FRPS scores.\n\nAdditionally, feature importance was extracted from the trained random forest model to determine the relative importance of each predictor variable. This step helped in identifying which variables had the most significant impact on the prediction of the FRPS score, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting by focusing on the most relevant features.\n\nThe use of a random forest regression model inherently provides a form of regularization. Random forests are an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees, each trained on a different subset of the data and a different subset of features. This approach helps to reduce overfitting by averaging the predictions of multiple trees, which tend to be less sensitive to the noise in the training data compared to a single decision tree.",

This ensures that researchers and practitioners can access and utilize the information to further their work in predicting and mitigating futile recanalization risks after endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is a random forest regression, which is generally considered a black-box model due to its complex structure involving multiple decision trees. However, efforts were made to enhance interpretability by calculating feature importance, which provides insights into the contribution of each predictor variable to the prediction of the target variable, the Futile Recanalization Prediction Score (FRPS).\n\nThe final equation for the FRPS model includes variables such as age, sex, atrial fibrillation (AF), hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia, cognitive impairment, pre-stroke modified Rankin Scale (mRS), systolic blood pressure (SBP), onset-to-puncture time, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH), and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score. Each of these variables has an associated coefficient that represents its relative importance in predicting the FRPS.\n\nFor example, the onset-to-puncture time has the highest feature importance, indicating it is the most significant predictor of the FRPS. This means that the time interval from stroke onset to puncture during endovascular thrombectomy plays a crucial role in determining the risk of futile recanalization. Other variables like SBP and age also have notable importance, though to a lesser extent.\n\nBy extracting feature importance from the trained random forest model, we can determine the relative impact of each predictor variable on the FRPS score. This approach helps in understanding which factors are most influential in predicting the severity risk of futile recanalization, thereby aiding in treatment planning and patient management.",
  "model/output": "The model developed is a regression model. Specifically, it employs a random forest regression algorithm to predict the Futile Recanalization Prediction Score (FRPS). This score is designed to assess the severity risk of futile recanalization after endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke. The model uses a variety of predictor variables, including age, sex, presence of conditions like atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, cognitive impairment, pre-stroke modified Rankin Scale score, systolic blood pressure, onset-to-puncture time, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, and NIHSS score. The final equation for the FRPS model incorporates these variables, with coefficients determined by the random forest model, reflecting the importance of each predictor in the overall score. The model's performance was evaluated using cross-validation with five folds, achieving a mean R-squared value of approximately 0.992, indicating a strong fit to the data. The FRPS scores are categorized into severity ranges: mild (FRPS score < 66), moderate (FRPS score \u2265 66 and < 81), and severe (FRPS score \u2265 81). This regression model provides valuable insights for treatment planning and patient management by predicting the severity risk of futile recanalization.",

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method for the Futile Recanalization Prediction Score (FRPS) involved a rigorous process to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability. Initially, various statistical techniques were employed to refine the model, including the calculation of mean scores and the plotting of histograms of FRPS scores. These steps helped in understanding the distribution and potential outliers in the data.\n\nTo assess the model's performance, cross-validation with five folds was utilized. This technique involves dividing the dataset into five subsets, training the model on four subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated five times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. The mean R-squared value across all folds was computed to evaluate the model's fit to the data. The random forest regression model achieved a mean R-squared value of approximately 0.992, indicating a strong relationship between the predictor variables and the FRPS scores.\n\nFeature importance was extracted from the trained random forest model to determine the relative importance of each predictor variable. This provided insights into which variables had the most significant impact on the prediction of the FRPS score. The final equation for the FRPS model was derived based on these feature importances, ensuring that the most clinically relevant and statistically significant variables were included.\n\nAdditionally, the model's performance was evaluated by simulating FRPS scores for 1000 hypothetical patients. This simulation helped in defining severity ranges for the FRPS scores, which were classified as mild (FRPS score < 66), moderate (FRPS score \u2265 66 and <81), and severe (FRPS score \u2265 81). These ranges provide a clear framework for clinicians to interpret the FRPS and make informed decisions about patient management.",
  "evaluation/measure": "The performance of the Futile Recanalization Prediction Score (FRPS) model was primarily evaluated using the R-squared metric. The random forest regression model achieved a mean R-squared value of approximately 0.992, indicating a strong relationship between the predictor variables and the FRPS scores. This high R-squared value suggests that the model explains nearly all the variability of the response data around its mean.\n\nCross-validation with five folds was employed to assess the generalizability and fit of the model. This technique helps ensure that the model's performance is consistent across different subsets of the data, providing a robust estimate of its predictive accuracy.\n\nWhile the R-squared value is a key performance metric, it is important to note that other metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) or root mean squared error (RMSE) were not explicitly mentioned. These additional metrics could provide further insights into the model's performance, particularly in terms of the magnitude of prediction errors.\n\nThe use of R-squared as the primary performance metric is consistent with common practices in regression analysis. However, including a broader set of metrics would offer a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's predictive capabilities. Future work could consider reporting additional performance measures to provide a more detailed assessment of the FRPS model's effectiveness.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the Futile Recanalization Prediction Score (FRPS) involved rigorous statistical analysis to ensure the robustness and reliability of the model. The performance metrics, particularly the R-squared value, were computed across multiple folds of cross-validation, providing a comprehensive assessment of the model's generalizability. The mean R-squared value of approximately 0.992 indicates a strong relationship between the predictor variables and the FRPS scores, suggesting high predictive accuracy.\n\nStatistical significance was a key consideration in the development of the FRPS. The p-values associated with various predictor variables were carefully examined to ensure that only significant predictors were included in the final model. For instance, variables such as onset-to-puncture time, systolic blood pressure, and age showed strong statistical significance, contributing meaningfully to the prediction of futile recanalization risk.\n\nConfidence intervals were not explicitly mentioned for the performance metrics, but the use of cross-validation and the high R-squared value provide a strong indication of the model's reliability. The random forest regression model, which was employed to capture nonlinear relationships, further enhances the confidence in the model's predictions. The feature importance extracted from the trained random forest model highlights the relative impact of each predictor variable, adding another layer of confidence in the model's robustness.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation of the FRPS demonstrates high statistical significance and strong performance metrics, supported by rigorous cross-validation and feature importance analysis. These factors collectively contribute to the confidence in the model's ability to predict futile recanalization risk accurately.",
