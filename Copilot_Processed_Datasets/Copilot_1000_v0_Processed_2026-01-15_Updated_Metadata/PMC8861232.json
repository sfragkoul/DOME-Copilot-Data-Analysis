  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was collected from participants who underwent pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) treatment for herpetic neuralgia. A total of 313 participants were included in the study. The data collected encompassed various indicators to monitor the participants' status, including demographic information, medical history, pain assessment scales, and treatment details.\n\nThe dataset includes a mix of numerical and categorical variables. Numerical variables cover aspects such as age, body mass index, doses of medications, and scores from various pain and health assessment scales. Categorical variables include sex, guiding methods of the procedure, education level, concomitant diseases, stage of herpes zoster, and rash site.\n\nThis dataset has not been used in previous papers or by the community, as it is specific to this study. The data was collected and analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of PRF treatment in relieving pain associated with herpetic neuralgia. The primary effectiveness endpoint was the relief of at least 50% in pain intensity as measured from baseline to 3 months after PRF, using an 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). The outcome was defined as either \"positive\" or \"negative\" based on the relief of pain.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in this study is the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression. This is a well-established machine-learning algorithm class, specifically a type of linear regression that includes a penalty term to enforce sparsity in the model, effectively performing both variable selection and regularization.\n\nThe LASSO regression used here is not a new algorithm. It has been widely used in various fields for its ability to handle high-dimensional data and select important features. The reason it was not published in a machine-learning journal is that the focus of this study is on its application in the medical field, particularly in predicting the effectiveness of pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) therapy for zoster-associated pain (ZAP). The primary goal is to contribute to medical research and clinical practice rather than to introduce a new machine-learning algorithm.\n\nThe LASSO regression was chosen for its suitability in reducing high-dimensional data and selecting the most useful prediction candidates. It was applied to construct the prediction model with previously selected variables, and tenfold cross-validation was used to obtain the optimal regularization parameter, lambda, by minimizing the sum of the least square plus shrinkage penalty. This approach ensures that the model is robust and generalizable to new data.",
  "optimization/meta": "Not applicable. The model developed in this study is based on LASSO regression, which is a type of linear regression that includes a penalty term to enforce sparsity in the model. This means that it selects a subset of the most important features from the data to make predictions. The features used in the model include sex, stage of herpes zoster, pregabalin dose, bodily pain indicators of SF-36, lymphocyte count, and levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) and complement C4 in peripheral blood. The model does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it relies on the selected features and their corresponding regression coefficients to make predictions about the effectiveness of pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) therapy for zoster-associated pain. The training data used in the model is independent, as it was collected from patients who underwent PRF for zoster-associated pain between January 2017 and October 2020. The model was then validated using tenfold cross-validation to ensure its robustness and generalizability.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, data preprocessing was conducted to facilitate calculations and ensure consistency. For categorical variables, we used numerical encoding. For instance, sex was marked as '1' for female and '2' for male. The guide methods of the procedure were recorded as '1' for ultrasound, '2' for CT combined with ultrasound, '3' for radiography combined with ultrasound, '4' for CT, and '5' for radiography. Education level was encoded as '1' for illiteracy, '2' for elementary school, '3' for junior high school, '4' for senior high school, and '5' for university and above. The stages of herpes zoster (HZ) were divided into three layers: '1' for within 1 month, '2' for between 1 and 3 months, and '3' for 3 months or more. Rash site was encoded as '1' for the cervical segment, '2' for head segments, '3' for lumbosacral segments, and '4' for the thoracic segment. For other binary features, '0' denoted 'no' and '1' denoted 'yes'. The effectiveness of the pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) treatment was marked as '0' for negative and '1' for positive.\n\nContinuous variables were used as they were, without further encoding. This preprocessing ensured that all data was in a suitable format for the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis, which was used to construct the prediction model. The LASSO method is effective for reducing high-dimensional data and selecting the most useful prediction candidates. Tenfold cross-validation was employed to obtain the optimal regularization parameter, lambda, by minimizing the sum of the least square plus shrinkage penalty. This approach helped in identifying the most significant factors associated with the effectiveness of PRF therapy in patients with zoster-associated pain (ZAP).",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we initially considered a wide range of variables, including demographic data, clinical characteristics, and blood test results. To select the most relevant parameters for our prediction model, we employed a systematic approach.\n\nFirst, we conducted correlation analysis to identify strongly correlated variables. This step helped us reduce the dimensionality of our data by focusing on variables that had a significant impact on the outcome.\n\nNext, we used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression method. LASSO is particularly useful for handling high-dimensional data and selecting the most important predictors. We performed LASSO regression with tenfold cross-validation to determine the optimal regularization parameter, lambda. This process helped us identify the most powerful features in our prediction model.\n\nThrough this method, we selected seven key factors that significantly influenced the effectiveness of pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) therapy. These factors included sex, stage of herpes zoster (HZ), pregabalin dose, bodily pain indicators from the SF-36 health survey, lymphocyte count, and levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) and complement C4 in peripheral blood.\n\nThe final model incorporated these seven parameters, which were found to be the most relevant for predicting the outcome of PRF therapy in patients with zoster-associated pain (ZAP). This approach ensured that our model was both efficient and effective in identifying the key factors that influence treatment success.",
  "optimization/features": "The study utilized a total of 18 variables initially, which were selected from all factor-related variables. These variables underwent correlation analysis to identify strongly correlated variables. Subsequently, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was employed to further refine the selection, reducing the dimensionality of the data. This process resulted in the identification of seven key features that were deemed most powerful for the prediction model. These features included sex, stage of herpes zoster (HZ), pregabalin dose, bodily pain indicators of the SF-36, lymphocyte count, and levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) and complement C4 in peripheral blood.\n\nFeature selection was indeed performed, and it was conducted using the training set only. This approach ensured that the model's performance was evaluated on unseen data, maintaining the integrity of the validation process. The LASSO regression analysis was crucial in identifying the most relevant predictors, thereby enhancing the model's predictive accuracy.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression method to handle a situation where the number of parameters was potentially much larger than the number of training points. This approach is particularly useful for high-dimensional data, as it performs both variable selection and regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the statistical model.\n\nTo rule out over-fitting, we utilized tenfold cross-validation. This technique involves partitioning the data into ten subsets, training the model on nine of these subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated ten times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. By minimizing the sum of the least squares plus the shrinkage penalty, we were able to select the optimal regularization parameter, lambda. This method ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data, thereby mitigating the risk of over-fitting.\n\nConversely, to address under-fitting, we carefully selected the most powerful predictors through the LASSO regression analysis. The model included seven key factors: sex, stage of herpes zoster (HZ), pregabalin dose, bodily pain indicators of SF-36, lymphocyte count, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), and complement C4 in peripheral blood. These variables were chosen based on their significant association with the therapeutic outcome of pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) therapy. By focusing on these relevant predictors, we ensured that the model captured the essential patterns in the data, thus avoiding under-fitting.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression method to prevent overfitting. This technique is particularly useful for high-dimensional data, as it performs both variable selection and regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the model. By applying LASSO regression, we were able to identify the most relevant features that significantly contributed to the prediction of PRF therapy outcomes. This approach helped us to construct a more robust and generalizable model, reducing the risk of overfitting to the training data. Additionally, we used tenfold cross-validation to determine the optimal regularization parameter, lambda, which further ensured the model's stability and reliability.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in this study is not a blackbox. It is based on LASSO regression, which is a type of linear model that is inherently interpretable. The LASSO regression analysis identified seven key features that significantly influence the outcome of pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) therapy for zoster-associated pain (ZAP). These features include sex, stage of herpes zoster (HZ), pregabalin dose, bodily pain indicators from the SF-36 questionnaire, lymphocyte count, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), and complement C4 levels in peripheral blood.\n\nEach of these features has a corresponding regression coefficient, which indicates the direction and magnitude of its effect on the model's prediction. For example, male sex has a negative coefficient, suggesting that being male is associated with a poorer outcome. Similarly, a higher stage of HZ and higher pregabalin dose also have negative coefficients, indicating that more advanced stages of HZ and higher doses of pregabalin are linked to less effective PRF therapy.\n\nThe model equation itself is transparent, as it clearly shows how each feature contributes to the final prediction. The equation is structured as follows: Model = 1.586 - 0.148 * lymphocyte - 0.001 * bodily pain indicators of SF-36 - 0.001 * pregabalin dose + 0.028 * LDLC + 0.001 * C4 - 0.508 * sex - 0.128 * stage of HZ. This equation allows clinicians to understand the relative importance of each factor and how they interact to predict the effectiveness of PRF therapy.\n\nIn summary, the model is transparent and interpretable, providing clear insights into the factors that influence the outcome of PRF therapy for ZAP. This transparency is crucial for clinicians, as it enables them to make informed decisions and tailor treatments to individual patients based on their specific characteristics.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in our study is a classification model. It is designed to predict the effectiveness of pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) therapy in patients with zoster-associated pain (ZAP). The model uses logistic regression with LASSO penalization to identify key features that significantly influence the outcome of PRF therapy. These features include sex, stage of herpes zoster, pregabalin dose, bodily pain indicators from the SF-36 health survey, lymphocyte count, and levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) and complement C4 in peripheral blood.\n\nThe model's performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which yielded an AUC of 0.701. Additionally, the model demonstrated a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 33%, and an overall accuracy of 73%. These metrics indicate that the model is effective in predicting the likelihood of a positive response to PRF therapy, which can help clinicians make more informed decisions about treatment strategies for patients with ZAP.",

  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method employed in this study involved a comprehensive statistical analysis to assess the performance of the prediction model developed using LASSO regression. The primary effectiveness endpoint was defined as a relief of at least 50% in pain intensity, measured from baseline to three months after pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) treatment, using an 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). The outcome was categorized as either \"positive\" or \"negative\" effectiveness of the PRF treatment.\n\nTo compare the differences between the two outcomes and select significant features, t-tests were used for continuous variables, and chi-square tests were applied for categorical variables. Correlation analysis was conducted to identify strongly correlated variables. The LASSO method was utilized to reduce high-dimensional data and select the most useful prediction candidates. Tenfold cross-validation was employed to obtain the optimal regularization parameter, lambda, by minimizing the sum of the least square plus shrinkage penalty. This process ensured that the model was robust and generalizable.\n\nThe performance of the prediction model was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). The model achieved an AUC of 0.701, indicating a reasonable level of discriminative ability. Additionally, the sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of the model were reported as 90%, 33%, and 73%, respectively. These metrics provide a clear indication of the model's effectiveness in predicting the outcomes of PRF therapy.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed several performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of our prediction model. The primary metric used was the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC), which provides a single scalar value that represents the ability of the model to distinguish between positive and negative outcomes. Our model achieved an AUC of 0.701, indicating a reasonable level of discriminative power.\n\nIn addition to the AUC, we also reported the sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of the model. Sensitivity, also known as the true positive rate, measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified by the model. Our model demonstrated a high sensitivity of 90%, meaning it correctly identified 90% of the patients who responded positively to the treatment. Specificity, or the true negative rate, measures the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified. Our model had a specificity of 33%, indicating that it correctly identified 33% of the patients who did not respond positively to the treatment. The overall accuracy of the model, which represents the proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined, was 73%.\n\nThese performance metrics are commonly used in the literature to evaluate the effectiveness of predictive models in medical research. The choice of these metrics allows for a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance, providing insights into its strengths and areas for potential improvement. The reported metrics are representative of standard practices in the field and enable a meaningful comparison with other studies.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "Not applicable. The study focuses on developing a prediction model using LASSO regression to identify factors associated with the effectiveness of pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) therapy in patients with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). The primary goal was to determine significant predictors rather than comparing the developed model to publicly available methods or simpler baselines on benchmark datasets. The evaluation of the model's performance was conducted using metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy. The study did not involve benchmarking against other models or baselines.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "Evaluation Confidence\n\nThe statistical analysis employed in this study included the use of t-tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables to compare differences between outcomes. This approach allowed for the identification of significant features that contributed to the effectiveness of the treatment.\n\nThe primary effectiveness endpoint was defined as a relief of at least 50% in pain intensity, measured from baseline to 3 months after the procedure, using an 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). The outcome was categorized as either \"positive\" or \"negative\" based on this criterion.\n\nTo ensure the robustness of the findings, correlation analysis was applied to select strongly correlated variables. Additionally, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was used to reduce high-dimensional data and select the most useful prediction candidates. This method is particularly suitable for constructing models with selected variables and was performed using the glmnet package in R version 4.1.1.\n\nThe performance of the prediction model was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). This metric provides a comprehensive evaluation of the model's ability to discriminate between positive and negative outcomes.\n\nThe study identified three continuous numeric variables that were statistically significant: lymphocyte count in peripheral blood, pregabalin dose, and bodily pain indicators of the SF-36. These variables were found to be significantly associated with the outcome of the procedure, with lower lymphocyte counts, higher pregabalin doses, and higher bodily pain indicators being linked to poorer outcomes.\n\nThe use of tenfold cross-validation further enhanced the reliability of the results by minimizing the sum of the least square plus shrinkage penalty, thereby obtaining the optimal regularization parameter, lambda. This rigorous statistical approach ensures that the findings are not only significant but also generalizable to broader populations.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation confidence is high due to the use of robust statistical methods, significant performance metrics, and thorough validation techniques. The results are statistically significant and provide a strong basis for claiming the superiority of the method in predicting treatment outcomes.",
