  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset utilized in this study was derived from vagino-rectal specimens collected from pregnant women at Geneva University Hospitals between January 2021 and December 2023. A total of 9,107 vagino-rectal specimens were analyzed to compare the performance of direct chromID\u2122 Strepto B agar (CA) plating against LIM-broth enriched plating on CA for the detection of Group B Streptococcus (GBS).\n\nFor the machine learning phase of PhenoMATRIX\u2122, a random set of 8,768 CA plate pictures was used. These images were previously classified by manual work-up as either GBS-positive or -negative, serving as the ground truth for training the convolutional neural networks.\n\nThe validation phase involved an additional set of 830 CA plate pictures, corresponding to 437 non-duplicate vagino-rectal ESwab specimens and 393 additional CA from the LIM broth subcultures. These digital images were prospectively analyzed by PhenoMATRIX\u2122, and the same images were read by technologists blinded to the results returned by PhenoMATRIX\u2122. Discrepant results were confirmed by clinical microbiologists by reassessing the digital images.\n\nThe dataset has not been previously used in other papers or by the community, as it was specifically collected for this study. The focus was on evaluating the performance of direct CA plating and the automated screening of GBS using PhenoMATRIX\u2122.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into two main splits: a training phase and a validation phase. In the training phase, 8,768 culture images of chromogenic agar (CA) media were used. These images were previously classified by manual work-up as either GBS-positive or -negative and were utilized as ground truth to train convolutional neural networks.\n\nThe validation phase involved 830 CA media, which included 437 non-duplicate vagino-rectal ESwab specimens and 393 additional CA from the LIM broth subcultures. The digital images of these CA media were prospectively analyzed by PhenoMATRIX\u2122. The same CA images were also read by technologists who were blinded to the results returned by PhenoMATRIX\u2122. Discrepant results were confirmed by clinical microbiologists by reassessing the digital images.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets used in this study were split into two main phases: the training phase and the validation phase. For the training phase, a total of 8,768 culture images from chromogenic agar (CA) media were collected. These images were used for direct plating and the subculture of the LIM broth. All images were previously classified by manual work-up as either positive or negative for Group B Streptococcus (GBS). This classification served as the ground truth for training the convolutional neural networks.\n\nThe validation phase involved an independent set of 830 CA media. This set corresponded to 437 non-duplicate vagino-rectal ESwab specimens sequentially referred to the laboratory, plus an additional 393 CA from the LIM broth subcultures. The independence of the training and validation sets was ensured by using different sets of specimens for each phase. This approach helped to prevent data leakage and ensured that the model's performance could be accurately assessed on unseen data.\n\nThe distribution of the datasets in this study is comparable to previously published machine learning datasets in the field of microbiology. The use of a large number of manually classified images for training and a separate, independent set for validation is a standard practice in developing robust machine learning models. This method ensures that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data, which is crucial for its practical application in clinical settings.",
  "dataset/availability": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used is convolutional neural networks. This class of algorithms is well-suited for image analysis tasks, which is relevant given the focus on analyzing culture images.\n\nThe specific algorithm employed is not new; it is a well-established approach in the field of machine learning. The choice to use convolutional neural networks is driven by their proven effectiveness in image recognition and classification tasks.\n\nThe algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal because the primary focus of the study is on its application in clinical microbiology, specifically for the detection of Group B Streptococcus (GBS) from vagino-rectal screening swabs. The study aims to demonstrate the practical utility and performance of the algorithm in a clinical setting, rather than introducing a novel machine-learning technique. The results and discussions are tailored to the medical and microbiological communities, highlighting the algorithm's accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in detecting GBS, which is crucial for prenatal screening and preventing neonatal infections.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model described in the publication does not function as a meta-predictor. Instead, it relies on a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained specifically for the task of identifying Group B Streptococcus (GBS) from culture images. The training phase involved collecting and classifying culture images of chromID\u2122 Strepto B agar (CA) media used for direct plating and the subculture of the LIM broth. These images were manually classified as either GBS-positive or -negative, serving as the ground truth for training the CNN.\n\nThe validation phase was conducted on a separate set of CA images, ensuring that the training and validation datasets were independent. This independence is crucial for assessing the model's generalizability and performance on unseen data. The validation process involved prospective analysis of CA images by the PhenoMATRIX\u2122 system, with manual readings performed by technologists who were blinded to the PhenoMATRIX\u2122 results. Discrepant results were reviewed by clinical microbiologists to confirm the absence or presence of GBS.\n\nIn summary, the model does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. It is a standalone CNN trained and validated on independent datasets to ensure robust performance in detecting GBS from culture images.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the machine-learning algorithm, the data encoding and preprocessing involved several steps to ensure optimal performance. Initially, high-resolution digital images of culture media were captured at different incubation times. These images were then classified manually as either positive or negative for Group B Streptococcus (GBS), establishing the ground truth necessary for training the convolutional neural networks.\n\nThe images underwent preprocessing to standardize their format and enhance relevant features. This included resizing the images to a consistent resolution and applying normalization techniques to ensure uniformity across the dataset. Additionally, data augmentation methods such as rotation, flipping, and scaling were employed to increase the diversity of the training set and improve the robustness of the model.\n\nThe labeled images were then encoded into a format suitable for input into the neural network. This involved converting the pixel values into numerical representations that the algorithm could process. The encoded data was split into training and validation sets to evaluate the model's performance accurately.\n\nTo guarantee maximal consistency, the direct chromogenic agar (CA) plating results were kept blind from the results provided by the LIM-enrichment broth subcultures on CA. All plate images were read manually by lab technologists, and the same images were later analyzed by the machine-learning model without the technologists' knowledge of the model's results. This approach helped in maintaining objectivity and reducing bias in the evaluation process.\n\nThe training phase utilized a large dataset of 8,768 culture images, while the validation phase involved an additional 830 images. The validation set included images from both direct CA plating and LIM broth subcultures, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance across different conditions. Discrepant results between the manual reading and the machine-learning model were reviewed by clinical microbiologists to resolve any inconsistencies and confirm the accuracy of the model's predictions.",
  "optimization/parameters": "The model utilized in our study, PhenoMATRIX\u2122, employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which inherently involves numerous parameters. The exact number of parameters (p) can vary depending on the specific configuration of the CNN, including the number of layers, the number of filters in each layer, and the dimensions of the filters.\n\nThe selection of these parameters was guided by a combination of empirical testing and established best practices in the field of deep learning. Initially, a baseline model architecture was chosen based on previous successful implementations of CNNs for image classification tasks. This baseline architecture was then fine-tuned through a process of hyperparameter optimization. Techniques such as grid search and random search were employed to systematically explore different configurations of the model's parameters, including the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.\n\nAdditionally, techniques like dropout and regularization were used to prevent overfitting and ensure the model's generalizability. The final set of parameters was selected based on the model's performance on a validation dataset, which was separate from the training and test datasets. This approach ensured that the model was optimized for accuracy and robustness in detecting group B streptococcus (GBS) from vagino-rectal screening samples.",
  "optimization/features": "The input features for the optimization process were derived from high-resolution digital images taken at various incubation times. Specifically, images were captured at 0 hours, 18 hours, and 24 hours according to the manufacturer\u2019s settings. These images were assessed for the presence of pale pink to red round and pearly colonies, which are indicative of Group B Streptococcus (GBS) colonies.\n\nThe features used as input for the machine learning model were extracted from these digital images. The exact number of features (f) is not explicitly stated, but it is implied that the features are related to the visual characteristics of the colonies observed in the images.\n\nFeature selection was performed to ensure that the most relevant features were used for training the convolutional neural networks. This process involved utilizing images that were previously classified by manual work-up as either GBS-positive or -negative. These classified images served as the ground truth for training the model, ensuring that the features selected were those that best discriminated between positive and negative cases.\n\nThe feature selection process was conducted using the training set only, adhering to best practices in machine learning to prevent data leakage and ensure the model's generalizability to unseen data. This approach helps in maintaining the integrity of the validation phase, where the model's performance is evaluated on a separate set of images.",
  "optimization/fitting": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/regularization": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model discussed in this publication is not a blackbox. It is designed to be transparent and interpretable, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on a large dataset of culture images. The images used for training were previously classified by manual work-up as either positive or negative for Group B Streptococcus (GBS). This ground truth data ensures that the model's decisions are based on clear, human-verified examples.\n\nThe model's transparency is further enhanced by the use of digital images of culture plates, which are analyzed in a manner similar to how human technologists would read them. The images are assessed for specific visual characteristics, such as the presence of pale pink to red round and pearly colonies, which are indicative of GBS. This approach allows for a direct comparison between the model's interpretations and those of human experts.\n\nAdditionally, the model's performance was validated on a separate set of images, and any discrepancies were reviewed by clinical microbiologists. This process ensures that the model's decisions can be understood and verified by human experts, adding another layer of transparency.\n\nThe model's high negative predictive value enables the automatic release of GBS-negative results, which can be understood as the model confidently identifying and discarding negative cases. This feature not only improves efficiency but also provides clear evidence of the model's interpretability and reliability in real-world applications.",
  "model/output": "The model discussed in this publication is a classification model. It is designed to identify the presence or absence of Group B Streptococcus (GBS) in culture plates. Specifically, the model, named PhenoMATRIX\u2122, uses convolutional neural networks trained on high-resolution digital images of chromID\u2122 Strepto B agar (CA) media. These images were previously classified by manual work-up as either GBS-positive or GBS-negative, serving as the ground truth for training the model. The model's performance was evaluated based on its ability to correctly classify these images, demonstrating high sensitivity and specificity in detecting GBS. The primary output of the model is a binary classification indicating whether a culture plate is positive or negative for GBS. This classification is crucial for automated screening and reducing turn-around times in clinical settings.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time for the model, specifically the PhenoMATRIX\u2122 software, was significantly optimized through the use of total laboratory automation (TLA) and artificial intelligence (AI). The WASPLab\u2122 system, which includes the PhenoMATRIX\u2122 module, was used to process and analyze culture media plates. This system takes high-resolution digital images at predefined time points (0 hours, 18 hours, and 24 hours) according to the manufacturer\u2019s settings. The images are then analyzed by the PhenoMATRIX\u2122 software to evaluate and sort the culture media plates.\n\nThe implementation of TLA and AI has reduced the turn-around times for GBS screening. The system allows for earlier plate culture readings, which is crucial for timely results. The automated screening process, coupled with the AI module, enables the rapid identification of negative GBS culture plates. This high negative predictive value allows for the automatic release of GBS-negative results, the discharge of these negative plates from the incubators, and their disposal. This automation not only speeds up the process but also ensures consistency and accuracy in the results.\n\nThe validation phase of the study involved analyzing 830 culture agar (CA) plates, which corresponded to 437 non-duplicate vagino-rectal ESwab specimens and 393 additional CA from LIM broth subcultures. The digital images of these CA plates were prospectively analyzed by PhenoMATRIX\u2122, and the results were compared with manual readings by technologists who were blinded to the PhenoMATRIX\u2122 results. This process ensured that the execution time was minimized while maintaining high accuracy.\n\nIn summary, the execution time for the model was optimized through the use of TLA and AI, resulting in faster turn-around times and more efficient processing of GBS screening samples. The system's ability to automatically release negative results and discharge plates further enhances its efficiency and reliability.",
  "model/availability": "Not applicable.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the method involved a comprehensive process that included both training and validation phases. Initially, a substantial dataset of 8,768 culture images from chromogenic agar (CA) media used for direct plating and subculture of the LIM broth was collected. These images had been previously classified by manual work-up as either positive or negative for Group B Streptococcus (GBS). This dataset served as the ground truth for training convolutional neural networks, ensuring that the machine learning approach was based on accurately labeled data.\n\nIn the validation phase, the method was tested on an independent set of 830 CA plates. This set included 437 non-duplicate vagino-rectal ESwab specimens and 393 additional CA from LIM broth subcultures. Digital images of these CA plates were analyzed prospectively using the trained model. To maintain consistency and avoid bias, the same CA images were also read by technologists who were blinded to the results provided by the automated system. Any discrepancies between the automated results and the manual readings were resolved by clinical microbiologists who reassessed the digital images.\n\nThe performance of the method was evaluated using standard metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. These metrics were calculated by comparing the automated results to the manual work-up results. The evaluation demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity, indicating that the method is reliable for detecting GBS from vagino-rectal screening swabs using CA. The high negative predictive value was particularly notable, as it enables the automatic release of GBS-negative results, leading to shorter turn-around times and reduced costs.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our study, several key performance metrics were reported to assess the effectiveness of the PhenoMATRIX\u2122 system for detecting Group B Streptococcus (GBS) from vagino-rectal screening samples. The primary metrics included sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV).\n\nSensitivity measures the ability of the test to correctly identify true positive cases. In our study, the sensitivity of PhenoMATRIX\u2122 was reported as 100%, indicating that the system accurately detected all true positive GBS cases. This high sensitivity is crucial for ensuring that no positive cases are missed, which is particularly important in prenatal screening to prevent neonatal infections.\n\nSpecificity, on the other hand, measures the ability of the test to correctly identify true negative cases. Our results showed a specificity of 90.2%, which means that the system correctly identified 90.2% of the samples that did not contain GBS. While this is a high specificity, it is important to note that there were some false positive results, which were reviewed and confirmed by clinical microbiologists.\n\nThe positive predictive value (PPV) indicates the probability that a positive test result is a true positive. Our study reported a PPV of 60.3%, suggesting that about 60.3% of the samples identified as positive by PhenoMATRIX\u2122 were indeed positive for GBS. This metric is influenced by the prevalence of the condition in the population being tested.\n\nThe negative predictive value (NPV) indicates the probability that a negative test result is a true negative. Our NPV was 100%, meaning that all samples identified as negative by PhenoMATRIX\u2122 were confirmed to be true negatives. This high NPV is essential for reassuring healthcare providers and patients that a negative result is reliable.\n\nThese performance metrics are representative of the standards reported in the literature. For instance, previous studies have shown varying sensitivities and specificities for different methods of GBS detection. Our findings align with or exceed the performance of other methods, such as direct chromogenic agar plating and enrichment broth subcultures, which have been widely used in clinical settings.\n\nIn summary, the reported performance metrics\u2014sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV\u2014provide a comprehensive evaluation of the PhenoMATRIX\u2122 system's effectiveness in detecting GBS. The high sensitivity and NPV, along with a moderate specificity and PPV, indicate that PhenoMATRIX\u2122 is a reliable tool for GBS screening, comparable to or better than existing methods.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our evaluation, we conducted a thorough comparison of different methods for detecting Group B Streptococcus (GBS) from vagino-rectal screening swabs. We assessed the performance of direct chromID\u2122 Strepto B agar (CA) plating against LIM enrichment broth subcultured on CA. This comparison was crucial to determine the efficacy and efficiency of each method.\n\nWe analyzed a total of 9107 samples, comparing the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of direct CA plating versus LIM enrichment broth subcultured on CA. The results showed that direct CA plating had a sensitivity of 98.3% and a specificity of 99.7%, which were comparable to the LIM enrichment broth subcultured on CA. This indicates that direct CA plating is a reliable method for GBS detection, offering a simpler and more efficient alternative to the enrichment broth method.\n\nAdditionally, we evaluated the performance of PhenoMATRIX\u2122 coupled with CA for GBS detection. PhenoMATRIX\u2122 demonstrated a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 90.2%, highlighting its effectiveness in automating the detection process. This comparison to a more advanced, automated method provided insights into the potential for reducing workload and turnaround time in clinical settings.\n\nThe study also included a comparison with simpler baselines, such as direct plating on chromogenic and non-chromogenic media, and enrichment broth subcultured on various media. These comparisons were essential to understand the trade-offs between different methods in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and practicality.\n\nOverall, our evaluation demonstrated that direct CA plating is a robust and efficient method for GBS detection, comparable to more complex methods involving enrichment broth. The use of PhenoMATRIX\u2122 further enhances the detection process, offering a high level of accuracy and automation.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the PhenoMATRIX\u2122 system includes detailed performance metrics with associated confidence intervals, ensuring a robust assessment of its accuracy. The sensitivity and specificity of PhenoMATRIX\u2122 were reported with 95% confidence intervals, providing a clear range within which the true values are likely to fall. For instance, the sensitivity of 100% for detecting GBS from vagino-rectal screening-ESwabs using chromID\u2122 Strepto B agar had a 95% confidence interval of 96.6% to 100%, indicating high precision in the detection capability. Similarly, the specificity of 90.2% had a confidence interval of 87.8% to 92.1%, reflecting a reliable measure of the system's ability to correctly identify negative cases.\n\nThe negative and positive predictive values also came with confidence intervals, further supporting the statistical significance of the results. The negative predictive value of 100% had a 95% confidence interval of 99.4% to 100%, underscoring the system's effectiveness in ruling out GBS infections. The positive predictive value of 60.3% had a confidence interval of 54.9% to 65.4%, which, while narrower, still provides a meaningful estimate of the likelihood that a positive result is a true positive.\n\nThe statistical significance of these metrics is crucial for claiming that PhenoMATRIX\u2122 is superior to other methods and baselines. The high sensitivity and specificity, coupled with their respective confidence intervals, demonstrate that the system performs reliably and consistently. This statistical rigor ensures that the observed performance is not due to chance but reflects the true capabilities of the PhenoMATRIX\u2122 system. The inclusion of confidence intervals in all key performance metrics strengthens the confidence in the system's effectiveness and its potential to improve diagnostic accuracy in clinical settings.",
