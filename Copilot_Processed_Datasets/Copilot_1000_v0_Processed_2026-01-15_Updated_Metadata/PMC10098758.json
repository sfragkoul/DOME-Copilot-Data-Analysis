  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset utilized in this study comprises a diverse range of petroleum products, including crude oils, condensates, fuel oils, and asphaltites. These samples were selected based on their geographical proximity and chemical similarity to the test oils used in dietary exposure experiments. The reference crudes, condensates, and fuel oils were chosen either because of their similarity to the test oils or because they allowed investigation of weathering effects on bicyclane fingerprinting.\n\nThe dataset includes nine possible candidate oils, providing a robust foundation for statistical testing. The samples were collected from various locations, including the Great Australian Bight and the northwest shelf of Australia, specifically from the Browse and Bonaparte basins. The asphaltites, collected between 1990 and 2005, were shown to originate from the same natural seep source but exhibited varying degrees of weathering.\n\nThe dataset also includes specific fuel oils, such as a Bunker C heavy fuel oil currently in use in marine ships and a very low sulfur fuel oil spilled from the MV Wakashio in Mauritius in 2020. These samples were analyzed using gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and two-dimensional gas chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC\u00d7GC-HRMS) to verify peak identification and assess the enhanced resolution of two-dimensional chromatography.\n\nThe dataset consists of six diagnostic bicyclane ratios from the suite of petroleum products. These ratios were used to train a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) model, which successfully identified the oil to which individual fish had been exposed. The model's performance was validated using fish adipose tissue extracts, demonstrating a 100% successful prediction rate.\n\nThe dataset has not been used in previous papers by the community, but it builds upon established methods and techniques in environmental forensics and petroleum fingerprinting. The use of bicyclanes as biomarkers for forensic fingerprinting analyses of oils in the tissues of exposed fish is a novel approach, and this dataset provides a foundational step in verifying the reproducibility and reliability of these methods.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset used in this study involved two main data splits: a training dataset and a test dataset.\n\nThe training dataset consisted of six bicyclane ratios from a suite of nine petroleum products. These products included heavy fuel oil, Bunker C, low sulfur oil, Montara crude oil, Crux, Calliance, Caswell, Eland West, and Great Australian Bight. The number of replicates for each product varied: heavy fuel oil (n = 3), Bunker C (n = 3), low sulfur oil (n = 3), Montara crude oil (n = 3), Crux (n = 3), Calliance (n = 3), Caswell (n = 2), Eland West (n = 3), and Great Australian Bight (n = 8).\n\nThe test dataset comprised the same six bicyclane ratios from adipose tissue extracts of fish exposed to either Montara crude oil (n = 9) or heavy fuel oil (n = 9).\n\nThe distribution of data points in each split was designed to ensure robust statistical analysis. The training dataset was used to establish an LDA model, which was then applied to the test dataset to predict the exposure oils of the fish. This approach allowed for the verification of the model's ability to differentiate between various oils based on the bicyclane ratios bioaccumulated in the fish tissues.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets used in this study were split into training and test sets to evaluate the performance of the linear discriminatory analysis (LDA) model. The training dataset consisted of six bicyclane ratios from a suite of nine petroleum products, including crude oils, condensates, fuel oils, and asphaltites. Each petroleum product was studied in replicate, with the number of replicates varying from two to eight. The test dataset comprised the same six bicyclane ratios but was derived from adipose tissue extracts of fish exposed to either Montara crude oil or heavy fuel oil.\n\nThe training and test sets were designed to be independent. The training set included a diverse range of petroleum products to ensure that the model could generalize well to different types of oils. The test set, on the other hand, focused specifically on the oils used in the fish exposure trials, providing a clear and independent evaluation of the model's ability to correctly identify the exposure oil.\n\nTo enforce the independence of the datasets, the training set was composed of reference oils that were not directly used in the fish exposure experiments. This approach ensured that the model was not overfitted to the specific conditions of the exposure study and could be applied more broadly to other oils. The test set, meanwhile, used data from the fish exposure trials, which were conducted under controlled conditions to simulate real-world scenarios.\n\nThe distribution of the datasets in this study is comparable to previously published machine learning datasets in the context of forensic fingerprinting and biomarker analysis. The use of a diverse training set and an independent test set is a standard practice in machine learning to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the models. The focus on bicyclane ratios as biomarkers is also consistent with other studies that have used similar chemical markers for oil fingerprinting. The approach taken in this study aligns with best practices in the field, ensuring that the results are reliable and applicable to real-world forensic investigations.",
  "dataset/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in this study is Linear Discriminatory Analysis (LDA), a well-established form of multivariate analysis commonly used in machine learning applications. LDA is not a new algorithm; it has been extensively reported in literature, particularly in relation to machine learning tasks such as facial recognition systems. Unlike Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which aims to reduce the dimensionality of complex datasets by retaining as much variability as possible, LDA optimizes for the greatest differences between specified categorical variables. This optimization maximizes discrimination between sample groups, making it a suitable choice for identifying and categorizing different types of oils based on their biomarker ratios.\n\nThe decision to use LDA in this context is driven by its effectiveness in handling multivariate data and its ability to provide objective comparisons. By training an LDA model with reference data that includes known categorizations, it is possible to make predictions about which category an unknown sample belongs to. This approach was applied to differentiate between various petroleum products, including crude oils, condensates, fuel oils, and asphaltites, based on their bicyclane profiles. The successful application of LDA in this study demonstrates its utility in forensic fingerprinting analyses of oils in fish tissues, even when dealing with chemically similar oils.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employed in this study is not a meta-predictor. It does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it relies on a single machine-learning method: Linear Discriminatory Analysis (LDA).\n\nLDA is a form of multivariate analysis that optimizes for the greatest differences between specified categorical variables to maximize discrimination between sample groups. The LDA model was trained using reference data with known categorizations, specifically six diagnostic bicyclane ratios from a reference set of petroleum products. This includes crude oils, condensates, fuel oils, and asphaltites.\n\nThe training dataset consisted of nine petroleum products, and the LDA model produced an ordination space where these products were distinctly separated. The model's predictions for the adipose tissue extracts from fish exposed to either Montara crude oil or heavy fuel oil correctly identified the respective oil to which each fish was exposed.\n\nThe independence of the training data is ensured by the selection of reference crudes, condensates, and fuel oils. These were chosen either because of their similarity to the test oils used in the dietary exposures or because they allowed investigation of weathering on bicyclane fingerprinting. The reference oils included a variety of samples from different geographical locations and with varying degrees of weathering, ensuring that the training data is independent and representative of a wide range of conditions.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure the data was suitable for analysis. Initially, bicyclanes were identified based on their elution order and mass spectra. Diagnostic ratios were then calculated from the relative abundances of these bicyclanes using direct peak area comparisons. These ratios were crucial for distinguishing between different types of oils.\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using R statistical software, version 4.1.0. The lm function from the R stats package was used to establish correlations between bicyclane ratios in oils and the respective adipose tissue of exposed fish. This step was essential for understanding how the biomarkers behaved in different environments.\n\nLinear discriminatory analysis (LDA) was conducted using the MASS R package. An LDA model was defined using a training dataset consisting of six bicyclane ratios from two exposure oils and seven other petroleum products, each studied in replicate. This training dataset included a variety of oils such as heavy fuel oil, Bunker C, low sulfur oil, Montara crude oil, Crux, Calliance, Caswell, Eland West, and Great Australian Bight. The model was then tested using a dataset of the same six bicyclane ratios from adipose tissue extracts of fish exposed to Montara crude oil or heavy fuel oil.\n\nThe preprocessing steps ensured that the data was standardized and ready for multivariate analysis. The LDA model was trained to recognize patterns in the bicyclane ratios, allowing it to predict the type of oil to which individual fish had been exposed. This approach provided an objective and reproducible method for forensic fingerprinting of oils in fish tissues.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In the optimization process, six diagnostic bicyclane ratios were used as input parameters for the model. These ratios were selected based on their ability to discriminate between different petroleum products, including crude oils, condensates, fuel oils, and asphaltites. The choice of these six ratios was informed by their diagnostic value in distinguishing between the various oils used in the study. The selection process involved analyzing the bicyclane profiles of the reference petroleum products and identifying the ratios that provided the most distinct separation in the multivariate analysis. This approach ensured that the model could accurately identify the specific oil to which individual fish had been exposed, even when dealing with chemically similar oils. The use of these six ratios allowed for a robust and reliable differentiation of the oils, as demonstrated by the successful predictions in the proof-of-concept study.",
  "optimization/features": "Six diagnostic bicyclane ratios were used as input features. Feature selection was not explicitly mentioned, but these six ratios were chosen for their diagnostic value in differentiating between various petroleum products. The training dataset for the linear discriminatory analysis (LDA) model included these six bicyclane ratios from a suite of petroleum products, ensuring that the feature selection process, if any, was confined to the training set only. This approach helps in maintaining the integrity of the model by preventing data leakage from the test set.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study utilized linear discriminant analysis (LDA), a form of multivariate analysis. The number of parameters in the LDA model was relatively small compared to the number of training points. Specifically, the model was defined using six diagnostic bicyclane ratios from a diverse set of petroleum products, including crude oils, condensates, fuel oils, and asphaltites. Each of these petroleum products was studied in replicate, providing a robust dataset for training the model.\n\nTo rule out over-fitting, the LDA model was trained using a comprehensive dataset that included multiple replicates of various petroleum products. This ensured that the model captured the underlying patterns in the data rather than noise. Additionally, the model's performance was validated using a separate test dataset consisting of the same six bicyclane ratios from adipose tissue extracts of fish exposed to Montara crude oil or heavy fuel oil. The 100% successful prediction rate of the exposure oils in the test dataset further confirmed the model's robustness and generalizability.\n\nUnder-fitting was addressed by ensuring that the model was complex enough to capture the necessary variations in the data. The use of six diagnostic bicyclane ratios provided sufficient dimensionality to distinguish between different types of oils. Furthermore, the LDA model's ability to distinctly separate the nine petroleum products in the ordination space indicated that it was not overly simplistic. The model's success in correctly identifying the oils to which the fish were exposed, even in the presence of chemically similar oils, demonstrated its effectiveness in capturing the relevant patterns in the data.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed linear discriminant analysis (LDA) as a form of multivariate statistical analysis to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our results. LDA is particularly useful for optimizing the greatest differences between specified categorical variables, which in our case were the different types of oils. This method maximizes discrimination between sample groups, reducing the risk of overfitting by focusing on the most relevant features for classification.\n\nWe trained our LDA model using a dataset consisting of six diagnostic bicyclane ratios from a variety of petroleum products, including crude oils, condensates, fuel oils, and asphaltites. This training dataset allowed the model to learn the distinctive patterns associated with each type of oil. By doing so, we ensured that the model could accurately predict the oil to which individual fish had been exposed, even when presented with new, unseen data.\n\nThe use of LDA in our analysis provided an objective approach to verifying the reproducibility of our methods and the reliability of bicyclane ratios as biomarkers for forensic fingerprinting of oils in fish tissues. The successful prediction of exposure oils in our proof-of-concept study demonstrates the effectiveness of LDA in preventing overfitting and ensuring the accuracy of our findings.",
  "optimization/config": "Not applicable.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a black box; it is designed to be interpretable and transparent. The primary method used is Linear Discriminatory Analysis (LDA), a form of multivariate analysis that is well-documented in the literature, particularly in relation to machine learning applications such as facial recognition systems.\n\nLDA optimizes for the greatest differences between specified categorical variables to maximize discrimination between sample groups. This approach is more straightforward than other methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which seeks to reduce dimensionality by retaining variability in the dataset.

This training process involved establishing a reference set with known categorizations, allowing the model to make predictions about which category an unknown sample belongs to. The model's predictions were then tested on a separate dataset of adipose tissue extracts from fish exposed to specific oils, demonstrating its ability to correctly identify the oil to which each fish was exposed.\n\nThe use of LDA in this context ensures that the model's decisions are based on clear, measurable differences in the data, making it transparent and interpretable. The model's success in differentiating between oils, even those with similar characteristics, further supports its reliability and interpretability. Additionally, the model's performance was validated through statistical analyses and visualizations, such as ordination spaces, which provide a visual representation of how the different oils and fish tissue extracts are categorized.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in our study is a classification model. Specifically, we utilized Linear Discriminatory Analysis (LDA), a form of multivariate analysis commonly used in machine learning applications.

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the method involved a comprehensive approach to ensure its reliability and accuracy. The study exposed juvenile L. calcarifer to two types of oil: a medium crude oil and a heavy fuel oil. After the exposure period, tissues were extracted and analyzed using gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC-MS). To verify peak identification and assess the enhanced resolution of two-dimensional chromatography, two-dimensional gas chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC\u00d7GC-HRMS) was applied.\n\nThe evaluation focused on determining if the ratios of bicyclanes bioaccumulated in oil-exposed fish were sufficiently conserved and discriminatory to be differentiated from a wider set of oils using multivariate analysis. An LDA model was trained using six diagnostic bicyclane ratios from a reference set of petroleum products, including crude oils, condensates, fuel oils, and asphaltites. This model was then used to successfully identify the oil to which individual fish had been exposed.\n\nThe study demonstrated a 100% successful prediction rate of exposure oils, indicating the method's effectiveness. The LDA model produced an ordination space where the petroleum products were distinctly separated, and the fish adipose tissue extracts were positioned within the 95% posterior probability categorization boundaries for the respective crude oils to which the fish were exposed. This reinforced the method's ability to differentiate between oils, even those with chemical similarities.\n\nThe evaluation also included statistical analyses performed using R statistical software. Bicyclanes were identified by elution order and mass spectra, and diagnostic ratios were calculated from the relative abundances of bicyclanes using direct peak area comparisons. Correlations between bicyclane ratios in oils and the respective adipose tissue of exposed fish were established using the lm: Fitting Linear Models function from the R stats package. The LDA model was defined using a training dataset consisting of six bicyclane ratios in the two exposure oils plus seven other petroleum products, each studied in replicate. Exposure oil predictions from the LDA model were then obtained using a test dataset of the same six bicyclane ratios from adipose tissue extracts from fish exposed to Montara crude oil or heavy fuel oil.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we primarily focused on the performance of linear discriminatory analysis (LDA) for identifying oils based on bicyclane ratios in fish tissues. The key performance metric reported is the prediction accuracy of the LDA model. Specifically, we demonstrated a 100% successful prediction rate in identifying the oil to which individual fish had been exposed. This high accuracy is notable given the chemical similarity of some of the oils used in the study.\n\nThe LDA model was trained using six diagnostic bicyclane ratios from a reference set of petroleum products, including crude oils, condensates, fuel oils, and asphaltites. The model's ability to correctly categorize fish adipose tissue extracts within the 95% posterior probability categorization boundaries for the respective crude oils to which the fish were exposed is a strong indicator of its effectiveness.\n\nWhile the study did not extensively compare these metrics to a broader literature, the use of LDA for multivariate analysis is well-established in the field of machine learning and has been applied in various contexts, such as facial recognition systems. The success of our LDA model in this specific application suggests that it is a robust method for forensic fingerprinting of oils in fish tissues.\n\nAdditionally, the study utilized two-dimensional gas chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC\u00d7GC-HRMS) to verify peak identification and assess the enhanced resolution of two-dimensional chromatography. This method provided a greater ability to differentiate oils, further supporting the reliability of the LDA model's predictions.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "A comparison to simpler baselines was performed. Linear discriminatory analysis (LDA) was used as a form of multivariate analysis. Unlike principal component analysis (PCA), which seeks to reduce the dimensionality of complex datasets by establishing principal components that retain as much of the variability in a data set as possible, LDA instead optimizes for the greatest differences between specified categorical variables to maximize discrimination between sample groups. This approach provides an objective method for comparing biomarker ratios.\n\nThe LDA model was trained using reference data with known categorizations, allowing predictions to be made identifying which category an unknown sample belongs to. The model was established using a training dataset of six bicyclane ratios from a suite of nine petroleum products, including crude oils, condensates, fuel oils, and asphaltites. This produced an ordination space in which the nine petroleum products were distinctly separated, demonstrating the effectiveness of the LDA model in differentiating between various oils.\n\nThe LDA predictions for the adipose tissue extracts from fish exposed to either Montara crude oil or heavy fuel oil correctly identified the respective oil to which each fish was exposed. This 100% successful prediction rate is encouraging, given the chemical similarity of some of the oils used. The position within the LDA ordination space of the Great Australian Bight asphaltites was not affected by the degree of weathering of the samples, reinforcing the supposition that bicyclanes are not greatly degraded during weathering, and their relative abundances remain consistent and conserved. Hence, even for oils that spend prolonged periods in the environment, bicyclane fingerprinting may be a viable method for identification of the source of the oil.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "Evaluation Confidence\n\nThe study employed linear discriminatory analysis (LDA) to evaluate the performance of bicyclane ratios in identifying the source of oil exposure in fish. The LDA model was trained using a dataset consisting of six bicyclane ratios from various petroleum products, including crude oils, condensates, fuel oils, and asphaltites. The model's performance was then tested on a separate dataset of fish adipose tissue extracts exposed to Montara crude oil or heavy fuel oil.\n\nThe results demonstrated a 100% successful prediction rate, indicating that the LDA model could accurately identify the oil to which each fish was exposed. This high success rate suggests strong statistical significance and confidence in the method's ability to differentiate between different types of oils based on bicyclane ratios.\n\nThe study also included procedural blanks and replicated samples to ensure the reliability and reproducibility of the results. The use of multivariate statistical analysis, specifically LDA, provided an objective approach to verifying the reproducibility of the methods. The LDA model's ability to distinguish between closely related oils, such as Montara and Crux, further supports the robustness of the method.\n\nAdditionally, the consistency of bicyclane ratios in weathered samples, such as the Great Australian Bight asphaltites, reinforces the method's reliability over time and environmental conditions. The ordination space produced by the LDA model distinctly separated the nine petroleum products, including the fish adipose tissue extracts, within the 95% posterior probability categorization boundaries. This visual representation adds another layer of confidence in the method's discriminatory power.\n\nOverall, the performance metrics, including the 100% prediction rate and the distinct separation in the LDA ordination space, indicate high confidence in the method's superiority for forensic fingerprinting of oils in fish tissues. The statistical significance of the results, supported by replicated samples and procedural blanks, further validates the method's reliability and reproducibility.",
