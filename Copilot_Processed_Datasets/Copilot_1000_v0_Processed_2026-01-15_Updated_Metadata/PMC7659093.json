  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was collected from athlete children aged 6 to 13 years who are active in sports clubs in Hamadan city, located in the west of Iran. The study employed a multi-stage cluster sampling method to randomly select participants, ensuring a diverse and representative sample. A total of 356 athlete children with more than one year of sports experience were included in the analysis.\n\nThe sample size was determined based on a sample error of 0.05, a significance level of 5%, and an estimated prevalence of dental injuries of 20%, with a design effect of 1.5. The response rate was 70%, leading to the final inclusion of 356 questionnaires for analysis.\n\nThe data collection process involved a self-reported questionnaire designed to gather information on sports-related dental injuries. This questionnaire was developed based on similar studies and literature reviews, ensuring its relevance and comprehensiveness. It was divided into three sections: demographic information, history of dental injuries, and awareness and use of oral protective equipment such as mouthguards.\n\nThe questionnaire's validity was assessed using face and content validity, and its reliability was confirmed through Cronbach's alpha coefficient. After validation, the questionnaire was distributed to the parents of the selected children, who provided responses on behalf of their children.\n\nThis dataset has not been used in previous papers by the community, as it is specific to this study focusing on sports-related dental injuries among young athletes in Hamadan. The data points collected include various factors such as age, sex, parental education, child's birth order, type and history of exercise activity, duration of exercise activity, and awareness and use of mouthguards. These factors were used as predictor variables in the random forest model to identify key factors associated with sports-related dental injuries.",

  "dataset/availability": "The data used in this study is not publicly available. The study involved a cross-sectional survey of 356 athlete children aged 6 to 13 years in Hamadan, Iran. The data collection was conducted through a self-reported questionnaire distributed to the parents or guardians of the selected children. The questionnaire gathered information on various factors such as age, sex, parental education, child's birth order, type and history of exercise activity, duration of exercise activity, and awareness and use of mouthguards.\n\nThe data was collected from June to October 2018, and the sample size was determined based on a sample error of 0.05, a significance level of 5%, and the prevalence of dental injuries of 20%. The study was approved by the research ethics committee of Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, ensuring that all ethical guidelines were followed.\n\nGiven the nature of the data collection and the ethical considerations involved, the dataset is not released in a public forum. The confidentiality and privacy of the participants were maintained throughout the study. Therefore, the data is not available for public access or reuse.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in this study is decision-tree based, specifically the random forest (RF) algorithm. This algorithm is not new; it is a well-established method in the field of machine learning for both classification and regression tasks. Random forest is a supervised learning method known for its simplicity, which makes it popular and widely used across various domains.\n\nThe choice to use random forest in this study was driven by its ability to provide a simple understanding and interpretation of results, as well as its capability to produce prediction rules. These rules are logical statements in the form of \"if (conditions) then (prediction),\" which are particularly useful for decision-making processes.\n\nThe study focuses on investigating the performance of the random forest algorithm in identifying factors associated with sports-related dental injuries in children aged 6 to 13 years. The algorithm's accuracy in predicting these injuries was compared with that of a logistic regression model, a traditional competitor in statistical analysis.\n\nThe random forest model demonstrated a higher prediction accuracy (89.3%) compared to the logistic regression model (84.2%). This indicates that the random forest algorithm is effective in this context, providing reliable predictions and identifying the relative importance of variables in the prediction of sports-related dental injuries.\n\nThe decision to publish this work in a sports science journal rather than a machine-learning journal is likely due to the specific application and focus of the study. The research aims to address a particular problem in sports medicine\u2014identifying factors associated with sports-related dental injuries\u2014and evaluates the performance of the random forest algorithm in this specific context. The findings are relevant to the field of sports science and medicine, making it appropriate for publication in a journal that caters to this audience.",

  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, the data encoding and preprocessing steps were crucial for ensuring the effectiveness of the machine-learning algorithm, specifically the random forest (RF) model. The dataset consisted of various predictor variables, including age, sex, parents' education, child's birth order, type of sports activity, duration of sports activity, awareness regarding the mouthguard, and mouthguard use. These variables were used as inputs to predict sports-related dental injuries, which were categorized into two class labels: \"yes\" and \"no.\"\n\nThe predictor variables were encoded in a manner suitable for the RF algorithm. Categorical variables, such as sex, parents' education, child's birth order, type of sports activity, awareness regarding the mouthguard, and mouthguard use, were converted into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding. This transformation allowed the algorithm to process these variables effectively.\n\nNumerical variables, such as age and duration of sports activity, were standardized to ensure that they were on a similar scale, which is important for the RF algorithm to perform optimally. Standardization involved subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each numerical variable.\n\nAdditionally, missing values in the dataset were handled through imputation techniques. For numerical variables, missing values were imputed using the mean or median of the respective variable. For categorical variables, missing values were imputed using the mode or a placeholder category.\n\nThe preprocessing steps also included splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set was used to build the RF model, while the testing set was used to evaluate the model's performance. This split ensured that the model's predictions were assessed on unseen data, providing a more reliable estimate of its generalization capability.\n\nIn summary, the data encoding and preprocessing involved converting categorical variables into numerical format, standardizing numerical variables, handling missing values through imputation, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. These steps were essential for preparing the data for the RF algorithm and ensuring accurate and reliable predictions of sports-related dental injuries.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized a total of eight input parameters for the random forest model. These parameters were selected based on their relevance to sports-related dental injuries and included age, sex, parents' education, child's birth order, type of sports activity, duration of sports activity, awareness regarding the mouthguard, and mouthguard use. The selection of these variables was guided by existing literature and expert knowledge in the field of sports dentistry. No specific feature selection method was employed to determine the number of parameters, as these variables were deemed essential for predicting sports-related dental injuries in the target population.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized a total of eight features as input variables for our random forest model. These features were selected based on their potential relevance to sports-related dental injuries and included age, sex, parents' education, child's birth order, type of sports activity, duration of sports activity, awareness regarding the mouthguard, and mouthguard use.\n\nFeature selection was not explicitly performed as a separate step. Instead, we relied on domain knowledge to choose the input features, ensuring that they were relevant to the prediction of sports-related dental injuries. This approach helped us maintain a balance between model complexity and interpretability.\n\nGiven that feature selection was not conducted using a specific algorithm, the choice of features was consistent across the entire dataset, including both the training and testing sets. This consistency ensured that the model's performance could be reliably evaluated without the risk of data leakage or overfitting.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study utilized the random forest (RF) algorithm, which is known for its robustness and ability to handle a large number of input variables without overfitting. The RF algorithm constructs multiple decision trees during the training phase, each based on a bootstrap sample of the data. This ensemble approach helps to reduce overfitting by averaging the results of the individual trees.\n\nThe number of trees in the forest was set to 1000, which is a common default parameter and ensures that the model is stable and generalizes well to unseen data. The number of variables analyzed at each node to find the best split was set to the total number of variables in the problem, which helps in capturing the complex interactions between the predictors.\n\nTo rule out overfitting, the out-of-bag (OOB) error was estimated. The OOB error is calculated using the samples that were not included in the bootstrap sample for each tree. This provides an internal estimate of the generalization error, helping to ensure that the model is not overfitting the training data.\n\nUnderfitting was addressed by using a sufficient number of trees and variables at each split, ensuring that the model captures the underlying patterns in the data. The permutation importance index was used to assess the importance of each variable, providing insights into which predictors contribute most to the model's predictions.\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using R packages randomForest and caret, which are well-established tools for implementing and evaluating RF models. The default parameters were used, which are known to work well for a wide range of problems. This approach ensures that the model is neither too complex (leading to overfitting) nor too simple (leading to underfitting), striking a balance that generalizes well to new data.",
  "optimization/regularization": "The random forest algorithm inherently includes regularization techniques that help prevent overfitting. This is achieved through several mechanisms:\n\nFirstly, random forests use multiple decision trees, each trained on a different bootstrap sample of the data. This process, known as bagging (bootstrap aggregating), reduces the variance and helps to prevent overfitting by averaging the results of multiple trees.\n\nSecondly, at each split in the tree, a random subset of features is considered. This randomness ensures that the trees are not too similar to each other, further reducing the risk of overfitting.\n\nAdditionally, the depth of the trees is limited, which helps to control the complexity of the model and prevents it from capturing noise in the data.\n\nThese techniques collectively make random forests robust to overfitting, even when dealing with complex datasets.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is a random forest (RF) algorithm, which is known for its interpretability compared to other complex machine learning models. Unlike black-box models, RF provides a clear understanding of its results through the production of prediction rules. These rules are logical statements in the form of \"if (conditions) then (prediction),\" making them easy to use in decision-making processes.\n\nOne of the key features of the RF model is its ability to identify the relative importance of variables in making predictions. This is achieved through the permutation importance index, which assesses how much the prediction error increases when the values of a variable are randomly permuted. Variables that lead to a greater increase in prediction error are considered more important. In this study, the results showed that mouthguard use and awareness had the highest importance in predicting sports-related dental injuries, followed by sex and age. This transparency allows for a straightforward interpretation of which factors are most influential in the model's predictions.\n\nAdditionally, the RF model's structure, consisting of multiple decision trees, allows for a sequential separation of data into distinct groups. This process increases the distance between groups in each isolation, making the decision-making path clear and understandable. Each tree in the forest contributes to the final classification, and the out-of-bag (OOB) error estimation provides a measure of the model's classification error rate, further enhancing its interpretability.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in this study is a classification model. Specifically, it is a random forest (RF) model designed to predict sports-related dental injuries. The RF model uses sports-related dental injuries as the response variable, with two class labels: \"yes\" and \"no.\" This indicates that the model is tasked with classifying whether a child has experienced a sports-related dental injury or not.\n\nThe RF model was constructed using several predictor variables, including age, sex, parents' education, child's birth order, type of sports activity, duration of sports activity, awareness regarding the mouthguard, and mouthguard use. These variables help the model to make accurate predictions about the likelihood of sports-related dental injuries.\n\nThe performance of the RF model was evaluated using a confusion matrix and accuracy metrics. The results showed that the RF model has a higher prediction accuracy (89.3%) compared to the logistic regression model (84.2%). This suggests that the RF model is effective in classifying sports-related dental injuries.\n\nAdditionally, the variable importance feature of the RF model was utilized to identify the most significant predictors. The results indicated that mouthguard use and mouthguard awareness are the most important variables in predicting sports-related dental injuries. Subsequently, sex and age were also found to be significant contributors to the prediction of injury.",

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the random forest (RF) method involved several key steps to assess its performance in predicting sports-related dental injuries. The study utilized a cross-sectional design with a sample of 356 athlete children aged 6 to 13 years, selected through a multi-stage cluster sampling method. The sample size was determined based on a sample error of 0.05, a significance level of 5%, and a prevalence of dental injuries of 20%, with a response rate of 70%.\n\nThe RF algorithm was constructed using sports-related dental injuries as the response variable, with two class labels: \"yes\" and \"no.\" The predictor variables included age, sex, parents' education, child's birth order, type of sports activity, duration of sports activity, awareness regarding mouthguards, and mouthguard use. The classification error rate, known as the out-of-bag (OOB) error, was estimated by considering all excluded samples from the bootstrap samples. The final classification was derived from the outputs of all trees.\n\nTo evaluate the variable importance, the permutation importance index was used. This involved assessing the change in prediction error when the OOB data for a specific variable was randomly permuted, while all other variables remained unchanged. This process was performed tree by tree as the RF was constructed. Variables that showed greater changes in prediction performance when permuted were considered more important.\n\nThe study also compared the accuracy of the RF model with that of a logistic regression model, a traditional competitor, to predict sports-related dental injuries. This comparison helped to validate the performance of the RF method in identifying factors associated with dental injuries in the studied population.\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using R packages randomForest and caret, with default parameters for RF, including 1000 trees (ntree) and the number of variables analyzed at each node to find the best split. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were conducted using SPSS 21 software, with frequencies and percentages used to summarize categorical variables and mean and standard deviations for continuous variables. The univariate association of dental injury with categorical variables was analyzed using the Chi-square test, with a significance level of 0.05.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our study, we focused on several key performance metrics to assess the effectiveness of our models in predicting sports-related dental injuries. The primary metric we reported was prediction accuracy, which measures the proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined. For the random forest model, we achieved an accuracy of 89.3%, while the logistic regression model had an accuracy of 84.2%. This indicates that the random forest model outperformed the logistic regression model in terms of overall prediction accuracy.\n\nIn addition to accuracy, we also utilized the confusion matrix to provide a more detailed breakdown of the model's performance. The confusion matrix allowed us to examine the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative rates, giving us a comprehensive view of how well each model performed in predicting both injured and non-injured cases.\n\nWe also assessed the relative importance of variables in the prediction of sports-related dental injuries using the random forest model. This was done by calculating the mean decrease in accuracy for each variable, which helps identify which factors contribute most significantly to the prediction. The results showed that mouthguard use and mouthguard awareness were the most important variables, followed by sex and age. This variable importance analysis not only aids in understanding the key factors influencing sports-related dental injuries but also enhances the interpretability of the random forest model.\n\nThe set of metrics we used is representative of common practices in the literature for evaluating predictive models. Accuracy is a widely reported metric due to its simplicity and interpretability, while the confusion matrix provides a more granular view of model performance. The variable importance analysis is also a standard technique in random forest applications, helping to identify the most influential predictors. Together, these metrics offer a robust evaluation of our models' performance and their applicability in predicting sports-related dental injuries.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we compared the performance of the random forest (RF) model with a traditional competitor, the logistic regression model, for predicting sports-related dental injuries. This comparison was not performed on publicly available benchmark datasets but rather on our specific dataset focusing on 6 to 13-year-old athlete children in Hamadan, west of Iran.\n\nThe comparison involved evaluating the accuracy of both models. The RF model demonstrated a higher prediction accuracy of 89.3% compared to the logistic regression model's 84.2%. This indicates that the RF model outperformed the logistic regression model in terms of accuracy. However, both models showed less accuracy in predicting those who were injured compared to those who were not.\n\nThe confusion matrix and the accuracy of each model were provided to support these findings. Additionally, the relative importance of variables in the prediction of sports-related dental injuries was identified using the RF model. The results showed that mouthguard use and mouthguard awareness were the most significant factors, followed by sex and age.\n\nThis comparison highlights the effectiveness of the RF model in predicting sports-related dental injuries and provides insights into the key factors contributing to these injuries.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our models focused on assessing their predictive performance using a confusion matrix and accuracy metrics. The random forest model demonstrated a higher prediction accuracy of 89.3% for sports-related dental injuries compared to the logistic regression model, which had an accuracy of 84.2%. However, it is important to note that confidence intervals for these performance metrics were not explicitly provided in our study.\n\nStatistical significance was considered in various aspects of our analysis. For instance, the mean age difference between children with and without sports-related dental injuries was found to be statistically significant (p = 0.006). Similarly, the prevalence of injuries was significantly higher in boys compared to girls (p = 0.008), and a mother\u2019s level of education had a significant effect on the prevalence of dental sports-related injuries (p = 0.045).\n\nIn the multiple logistic regression model, several factors were identified as statistically significant predictors of dental sports injuries. These included age (p = 0.021), sex (p = 0.037), awareness of mouthguards (p < 0.001), and the use of mouthguards (p < 0.001). These p-values indicate that the results are statistically significant, suggesting that the identified factors have a meaningful impact on the likelihood of sports-related dental injuries.\n\nWhile our study provides evidence of the superior performance of the random forest model over the logistic regression model in predicting sports-related dental injuries, the lack of confidence intervals for the performance metrics is a limitation. Future work could include a more detailed statistical analysis to provide confidence intervals and further validate the robustness of our findings.",
