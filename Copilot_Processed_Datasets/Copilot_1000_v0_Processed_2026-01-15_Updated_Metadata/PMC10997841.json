  "dataset/splits": "The study utilizes a total of 62 datasets, comprising 48 benchmark datasets and 14 independent datasets. These datasets are categorized into 12 types of RNA modification site sequences, including D, Nm, A-to-I, m1A, m2G, m5C, m5U, \u03c8, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, m6Am, m7G, and m6A. The datasets encompass six different species: Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli, Drosophila melanogaster, and Arabidopsis thaliana.\n\nThe benchmark datasets are used for training and validation purposes, while the independent datasets serve for testing the model's generalization capabilities. The length of RNA sequences varies across different datasets, with most sequences being 41 nucleotides long. However, specific datasets like AIH, AID, and m6AS2 have sequences of 51 nucleotides, while \u03c8S has sequences of 31 nucleotides. Some datasets, such as m7GH2 and m6AA, feature sequences of 101 nucleotides.\n\nSeveral datasets exhibit class imbalance, with the maximum imbalance ratio observed in the m2GM2 dataset being 0.063.

The detailed information for each dataset, including the number of positive and negative samples, is available in supplementary tables.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets used in our study encompass 12 types of RNA modification site sequence datasets, including D, Nm, A-to-I, m1A, m2G, m5C, m5U, \u03c8, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, m6Am, m7G, and m6A. These datasets are divided into 48 benchmark datasets and 14 independent datasets, curated from previous studies. The datasets cover six species: Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli, Drosophila melanogaster, and Arabidopsis thaliana.\n\nThe benchmark datasets are used for training and validation purposes, while the independent datasets are reserved for testing the robustness and generalization of our models. This split ensures that the training and test sets are independent, preventing data leakage and overfitting. The independent datasets are particularly important for evaluating the model's performance on unseen data, providing a more reliable assessment of its real-world applicability.\n\nThe distribution of the datasets varies across different RNA modification types and species. For instance, the A-to-I modification datasets (AIH and AID) and the m6A modification dataset (m6AS2) have an RNA sequence length of 51 nucleotides. The \u03c8 modification dataset (\u03c8S) has a sequence length of 31 nucleotides, while the \u03c8 modification datasets (\u03c8H and \u03c8M) and the m6A modification dataset (m6AS1) have a sequence length of 21 nucleotides. The m7G modification dataset (m7GH2) and the m6A modification dataset (m6AA) have a sequence length of 101 nucleotides.

The maximum imbalance ratio is 0.063, observed in the m2GM2 dataset. This imbalance is an important consideration in our study, as it can affect the performance and generalization of machine learning models. To address this, we employ techniques such as class weighting and synthetic data generation to ensure that our models are robust and reliable.\n\nIn summary, the datasets used in our study are carefully curated and split to ensure independence between training and test sets. The distribution of the datasets varies across different RNA modification types and species, with some datasets exhibiting class imbalance.

  "dataset/availability": "The source code and datasets utilized in this study are freely available. They can be accessed through the Journal of Biological Chemistry. This ensures that other researchers can replicate our findings and build upon our work. The availability of these resources promotes transparency and encourages further advancements in the field of RNA sequence feature encoding and prediction models.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used is Support Vector Machine (SVM). This is a well-established algorithm in the field of machine learning and has been widely used for various classification tasks, including those in bioinformatics.\n\nThe SVM algorithm used is not new. It has been extensively studied and applied in numerous domains. The reason it was not published in a machine-learning journal is that the focus of the current work is on its application in a specific context\u2014predicting RNA modification sites. The innovation lies in the combination of the SVM algorithm with a novel RNA sequence feature encoding method called BiPSTP, rather than in the development of a new machine-learning algorithm.\n\nThe SVM algorithm was chosen for its robustness and effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data, which is characteristic of RNA sequence features. The integration of SVM with the BiPSTP method has shown superior performance in identifying RNA modification sites across diverse datasets and species. This approach leverages the strengths of SVM in classification tasks while addressing the specific challenges posed by RNA sequence data.",
  "optimization/meta": "The mRNAPred model is not a meta-predictor. It does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it relies on a single machine-learning method, specifically the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, to make predictions. The model is trained using RNA sequence data encoded with the BiPSTP method, which extracts positional nucleotide information from both the 5' and 3' ends of the RNA sequence. The training data consists of benchmark datasets, and the model's performance is evaluated using independent datasets to ensure that the training and testing data are separate. This approach helps to validate the model's generalization capabilities and robustness.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, we employed a novel RNA sequence feature encoding method called BiPSTP (Bidirectional Position-Specific Trinucleotide Propensity) to transform RNA sequences into numerical feature vectors. This method captures both local and global information from the sequences by considering the position-specific nucleotide propensities in a bidirectional manner.\n\nThe encoding process begins by calculating forward and backward position-specific nucleotide propensity matrices for both positive and negative datasets. For an RNA sequence of length l, each nucleotide at position i (where \u03be + 3 \u2264 i \u2264 l \u2212 \u03be \u2212 2) is encoded as the difference between its encoding values derived from the positive and negative datasets. The encoding value for a nucleotide at position i is determined by the average of the forward and backward position-specific nucleotide propensity frequencies.\n\nA parameter \u03be is introduced to represent the interval between the current nucleotide and its forward or backward dinucleotide. By varying \u03be, we obtain different feature vectors, which are then concatenated to form a high-dimensional feature vector. This concatenated feature vector is used as input for the machine learning algorithm.\n\nTo ensure optimal performance, we meticulously recorded the best values of \u03be for each of the 48 benchmark datasets. These optimal values were used in the subsequent experimental validation to build prediction models. The encoded numerical data was then used to construct SVM machine learning models, and their performance was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation.\n\nAdditionally, we compared the BiPSTP method with 13 existing RNA sequence feature encoding methods. The comparison involved encoding the 48 benchmark datasets using each method, constructing SVM models, and evaluating their performance. The results demonstrated the efficacy of the BiPSTP method in capturing relevant features from RNA sequences for accurate prediction of RNA modification sites.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In the mRNAPred model, a single parameter, \u03be, is utilized. This parameter is integral to the BiPSTP method, which encodes RNA sequences into numerical features. The value of \u03be ranges from 0 to (l-5)/2, where l represents the length of the RNA sequence. This parameter determines the interval between the current nucleotide and its forward or backward dinucleotide, thereby influencing the encoded numerical features.\n\nThe selection of \u03be was guided by its impact on the model's performance. Experimental results, particularly those from 10-fold cross-validation on various datasets, demonstrated that different values of \u03be yield distinct numerical features. Notably, the performance of the prediction model varies with \u03be, with optimal performance observed at specific values. For instance, on the DS2 dataset, the best performance was achieved when \u03be was set to 0. However, on most benchmark datasets, performance improved with increasing \u03be until a certain point, after which it stabilized or slightly declined. This indicates that while higher values of \u03be can capture more comprehensive sequence information, they may also introduce redundancies or irrelevant features, leading to overfitting.\n\nThe optimal value of \u03be was determined through extensive experimentation and validation across multiple datasets. This process ensured that the selected value of \u03be balanced the capture of relevant sequence information with the avoidance of overfitting, thereby enhancing the model's predictive accuracy and generalization capabilities.",
  "optimization/features": "In the optimization process of our mRNAPred model, the input features are derived from the BiPSTP (Bidirectional Position-Specific Trinucleotide Propensities) method. This method encodes RNA sequences into numerical feature vectors, capturing both local and global position-specific trinucleotide propensities. The number of features (f) used as input varies depending on the parameter \u03be, which signifies the interval between the current nucleotide and dinucleotide in forward or backward directions. The resulting numerical feature vectors, encoded with various values of \u03be, are concatenated to form high-dimensional feature vectors.\n\nFeature selection was not performed in the construction of our model. The BiPSTP method is designed to extract discriminative numerical features from RNA sequences, thereby enhancing recognition performance and generalization capabilities. The concatenation of feature vectors encoded with different values of \u03be ensures that the model captures a comprehensive range of positional preference information, reducing the need for additional feature selection techniques. This approach allows the model to effectively utilize the encoded features without the risk of introducing redundancy or irrelevant features into the classification task.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The mRNAPred model employs a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a radial basis function kernel. The model's performance is evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation on 48 benchmark datasets, ensuring that the results are statistically significant.\n\nTo address the potential issue of overfitting, particularly given the high-dimensional feature vectors generated by the BiPSTP method, several strategies were implemented. Firstly, the parameter \u03be in the BiPSTP method was carefully tuned to balance the extraction of useful classification information while avoiding the introduction of redundant or irrelevant features. The optimal values of \u03be for each dataset were determined through meticulous experimentation, as recorded in Table 2. Secondly, the SVM classifier's parameters, specifically the penalty factor C and the gamma (\u03b3) of the radial basis function, were optimized using a grid search method with a step size of two times. This process helped in finding the best combination of parameters that minimized overfitting.\n\nTo rule out underfitting, the model's performance was extensively validated across multiple datasets and types of RNA modifications. The use of 10-fold cross-validation ensured that the model was tested on various subsets of the data, providing a robust assessment of its generalization capabilities. Additionally, the model's performance was compared with existing RNA sequence feature encoding methods, demonstrating its superior efficacy and predictive capabilities.\n\nThe evaluation metrics used, including accuracy (Acc), sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), along with visual performance metrics like AUROC and AUPRC, provided a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance. These metrics ensured that the model was not only accurate but also balanced in its predictions, avoiding both overfitting and underfitting.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our mRNAPred model. One of the key methods used was feature selection. By integrating feature selection techniques, we refined the feature space, eliminating redundancies or irrelevant features. This process helped to enhance the model's recognition and generalization capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized the 10-fold cross-validation method extensively. This technique involves dividing the dataset into 10 subsets, training the model on 9 subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated 10 times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. This approach helps to ensure that the model's performance is consistent and not overly tailored to a specific subset of the data.\n\nFurthermore, we carefully tuned the parameters of our Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, which is the core of our mRNAPred model. The optimal parameter penalty factor C and \u03b3 of the radial basis function were determined using a grid search method. This systematic approach helped to find the best parameters that balance model complexity and performance, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting.\n\nThe use of these regularization methods\u2014feature selection, 10-fold cross-validation, and parameter tuning\u2014ensured that our model generalizes well to unseen data and maintains high performance across different datasets.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations, optimization schedule, and model files are not explicitly detailed in the publication. However, the source code and datasets used in this study are freely available at the Journal of Biological Chemistry. This availability suggests that the necessary components for reproducing the experiments and optimizing the model are accessible to the research community. The source code and datasets can be utilized under the terms provided by the journal, which typically include open access for academic and research purposes. For specific details on the optimization parameters and schedules, researchers would need to refer to the provided source code and any accompanying documentation.",
  "model/interpretability": "The mRNAPred model, which combines the BiPSTP encoding method with an SVM classifier, offers a level of interpretability that is often lacking in deep learning models. Unlike black-box models, the SVM classifier used in mRNAPred provides a more transparent decision-making process. This transparency is enhanced by the BiPSTP method, which extracts numerical features from RNA sequences in a way that captures both local and global positional information of trinucleotides.\n\nThe BiPSTP method incorporates a parameter, \u03be, which signifies the interval between the current nucleotide and dinucleotide in forward or backward directions. By varying \u03be, different numerical features can be encoded, allowing for a detailed analysis of how specific positional preferences contribute to the classification of RNA modification sites. This parameterization adds a layer of interpretability, as it enables researchers to understand the importance of different positional contexts in the RNA sequence.\n\nMoreover, the use of SVM as the classification algorithm further aids in interpretability. SVM models are known for their ability to provide insights into which features are most influential in the classification process. By examining the support vectors and the decision boundaries, researchers can gain a better understanding of the key features that distinguish between different RNA modification types.\n\nIn summary, the mRNAPred model is not a black-box model. Its transparency is facilitated by the BiPSTP encoding method and the SVM classifier, both of which provide clear examples of how positional nucleotide information and specific features contribute to the prediction of RNA modification sites. This interpretability is crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms of RNA modifications and their impact on gene regulation and human health.",
  "model/output": "The model presented in this publication is a classification model. Specifically, it is designed to predict RNA modification sites across multiple types in different species. The model, named mRNAPred, employs a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, which is a type of supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. The SVM classifier utilizes a radial basis function and is trained using the LibSVM toolkit. The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy (Acc), sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). These metrics are used to assess the model's ability to correctly classify RNA modification sites.\n\nThe model's output is binary, indicating whether a given RNA sequence contains a modification site or not. The classification performance is validated through 10-fold cross-validation on 48 benchmark datasets and independent testing on 14 datasets across 12 distinct RNA modification types. The results demonstrate that the mRNAPred model outperforms other state-of-the-art models and classifiers, showcasing superior performance in predicting RNA modification sites.",

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of our method involved a comprehensive approach to ensure its robustness and accuracy. We employed 10-fold cross-validation to assess the performance of our models across various datasets. This method involves dividing the dataset into 10 subsets, training the model on 9 subsets, and testing it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated 10 times, with each subset serving as the test set once. This technique helps in providing a reliable estimate of the model's performance by ensuring that every data point is used for both training and testing.\n\nIn addition to cross-validation, we conducted rigorous independent testing across 14 distinct datasets. This involved training our SVM prediction model on benchmark data and then evaluating its predictive capabilities on these independent datasets. This step is crucial for validating the generalizability of our model to new, unseen data.\n\nFurthermore, we meticulously compared our models against existing models from a decade of literature. This comparison was done across the same datasets to ensure a fair evaluation. The results of these comparisons are summarized in detailed tables, highlighting the superior performance of our models in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Matthews correlation coefficient, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.\n\nThe evaluation also included the use of the Jackknife test method, particularly for small-sample datasets. This method ensures the reproducibility of results by systematically removing each data point and evaluating the model's performance on the remaining data.\n\nOverall, our evaluation methodology combines cross-validation, independent testing, and extensive comparisons with existing models to provide a thorough assessment of our method's performance and reliability.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our evaluation, we report several key performance metrics to comprehensively assess the efficacy of our models. These metrics include Accuracy (Acc), Sensitivity (Sn), Specificity (Sp), Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC). These metrics are widely recognized and used in the literature for evaluating the performance of predictive models, particularly in the context of RNA modification site prediction.\n\nAccuracy measures the overall correctness of the model's predictions, providing a general sense of how well the model performs. Sensitivity, also known as recall, indicates the model's ability to correctly identify positive instances, which is crucial for detecting true modification sites. Specificity measures the model's ability to correctly identify negative instances, ensuring that non-modification sites are accurately classified. The Matthews Correlation Coefficient offers a balanced measure that considers true and false positives and negatives, providing a single value that indicates the quality of binary classifications. Finally, AUROC evaluates the model's ability to distinguish between classes across all threshold levels, offering a comprehensive view of the model's performance.\n\nThese metrics collectively provide a robust evaluation framework, ensuring that our models are assessed on multiple dimensions of performance. This approach aligns with standard practices in the field, making our results comparable to other studies and highlighting the strengths of our models in identifying RNA modification sites.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In the \"Methods Comparison\" subsection, we conducted a thorough evaluation of our proposed method by comparing it with 13 existing RNA sequence feature encoding methods across 48 benchmark datasets. This comparison was essential to validate the efficacy of our approach. For each dataset, we encoded the sequences using each of the 13 methods and then constructed SVM machine learning models based on the encoded numerical data. The performance of these models was assessed using 10-fold cross-validation, a standard technique to ensure robust and unbiased evaluation.\n\nThe average performance metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Matthews correlation coefficient, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and area under the precision-recall curve, were calculated across all 48 datasets. These metrics provided a comprehensive view of how well each method performed on average. The results highlighted that our method outperformed the others, demonstrating its superiority in extracting relevant features from RNA sequences.\n\nAdditionally, we performed statistical tests, including Friedman's test and Nemenyi's test, to determine if there were significant differences in performance among the methods. The results confirmed that our method showed substantial improvements over the existing ones, reinforcing its effectiveness.\n\nWe also compared our method against simpler baselines, such as k-mer and dinucleotide-based encoding methods. These baselines served as foundational techniques to gauge the relative improvement offered by our more complex approach. The comparison showed that while simpler methods provided a basic level of performance, our method significantly enhanced the accuracy and reliability of RNA sequence classification.\n\nIn summary, the comparison to publicly available methods and simpler baselines on benchmark datasets underscored the robustness and superiority of our proposed method. The detailed evaluation and statistical analysis provided strong evidence of its effectiveness in RNA sequence feature encoding.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the BiPSTP method involved a rigorous statistical analysis to ensure the reliability and significance of the results. Initially, Friedman\u2019s test was employed to assess whether there were significant differences in performance among the various RNA sequence feature encoding methods. The test results, with p-values significantly smaller than 0.05, provided strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis, indicating substantial disparities among the methods.\n\nFollowing this, Nemenyi\u2019s test was conducted to further investigate the differences between pairs of methods. This test helped in determining which methods performed significantly better than others. The critical difference (CD) threshold was calculated to compare the average rank differences between methods. If the average rank difference exceeded this threshold, it indicated a significant performance difference at a 95% confidence level.\n\nThe performance metrics, including accuracy (Acc) and Mathew\u2019s correlation coefficient (MCC), were evaluated across 48 RNA modification datasets. The results were visualized to show the relative performance of each method, highlighting the best-performing values. Additionally, the performance of the mRNAPred model was compared against existing models on three key datasets: m5CH3, \u03c8H, and m6AH. The mRNAPred model demonstrated superior performance, with notable improvements in accuracy and other evaluation criteria.\n\nThe use of 10-fold cross-validation ensured that the results were statistically significant and reproducible. This method helps in mitigating the risk of overfitting and provides a robust evaluation of the model\u2019s performance. Overall, the evaluation process was designed to provide a comprehensive and statistically sound assessment of the BiPSTP method\u2019s efficacy.",
