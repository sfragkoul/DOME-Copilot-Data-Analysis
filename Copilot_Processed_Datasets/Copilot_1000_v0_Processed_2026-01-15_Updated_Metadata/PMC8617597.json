  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset utilized in this study is sourced from the ClinVar database, which is a widely recognized and comprehensive repository of human genetic variants and their clinical significance. As of May 25, 2021, over 3,000 LDLr variants have been annotated in ClinVar. These variants are categorized into six subclasses, providing a rich source of data for analyzing the pathogenicity of LDLr missense variants.\n\nThe dataset includes a substantial number of data points, with a focus on missense variants, which constitute a significant portion of the total LDLr variants. Specifically, missense variants represent over 40% of the total LDLr variants and more than 50% of the entries in the ClinVar database. This high representation underscores the importance of accurately predicting the pathogenicity of these variants.\n\nThe data used in this study has been previously characterized and annotated, making it a reliable source for developing predictive models. The ClinVar database is maintained with rigorous standards, ensuring that the variants are accurately classified based on their clinical significance. This reliability is crucial for training machine learning models that aim to predict the pathogenicity of LDLr variants with high accuracy.\n\nThe dataset's extensive annotation and the large number of variants make it an invaluable resource for the scientific community. By leveraging this data, the study aims to develop an advanced machine learning algorithm that can accurately predict the pathogenicity of LDLr missense variants, thereby aiding clinicians and researchers in interpreting the effects of these mutations.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into two primary subsets: the training series and the validation series. The training series contained approximately three-quarters of the pathogenic variants, totaling 499, and two-thirds of the benign variants, totaling 54. The validation series included the remaining pathogenic variants, totaling 166, and the remaining benign variants, totaling 26. This division was done randomly to ensure a balanced representation of both pathogenic and benign variants in each subset. The limited number of annotated benign variants influenced the proportion used in the training and validation groups. Additionally, random bootstrapping was employed to create training and validation subsets of the same sample size with replacement, generating one thousand bootstrapped samples to test the sampling distribution and present statistics with 95% confidence intervals.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset was divided into two subsets: a training series (T) and a validation series (V). This split was done randomly, ensuring that the variants were assigned independently to either the training or validation group. The training series was used to obtain Pik values and to train the machine learning models, while the validation series was used solely to assess the model's performance, without influencing the training process.\n\nFor pathogenic variants, three-quarters (499 out of 664) were allocated to the training set, with the remaining one-quarter (166) reserved for validation. In the case of benign variants, due to their limited number, two-thirds (54 out of 80) were used for training, and the remaining one-third (26) were used for validation. This approach ensured that the training and validation sets were independent, preventing data leakage and maintaining the integrity of the model evaluation process.\n\nThe distribution of variants in the training and validation sets was designed to reflect the overall distribution in the dataset, with a focus on having a sufficient number of examples for both pathogenic and benign variants. This balanced approach aimed to create a robust model that could generalize well to new, unseen data. The specific allocation of variants was chosen to maximize the utility of the available data while ensuring that the validation set could provide an unbiased estimate of the model's performance.",
  "dataset/availability": "The dataset used in our study is not publicly available in a forum. However, the code and the database used for the software are available at GitHub under the Creative Commons CC0 license. This license allows for the free use, modification, and distribution of the code and database, ensuring that others can build upon and improve our work.\n\nThe dataset itself consists of LDLr variants annotated in ClinVar, which is a public database of genomic variants and their relationships to human health. We used a subset of these variants, specifically missense variants, for our analysis. The dataset was split into training and validation subsets, with three-quarters of the pathogenic variants and two-thirds of the benign variants used for training, and the remaining for validation. This split was done randomly, ensuring that the variants were evenly distributed between the two subsets.\n\nThe dataset was used to train and validate various machine learning models, including linear discriminant analysis, linear neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, multi-layer perceptron, and radial basis function. The models were evaluated using statistical parameters such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. The results showed that the models were able to accurately predict the pathogenicity of LDLr variants, with an accuracy of over 80%.\n\nThe dataset was also used to develop a user-friendly software called MLb-LDLr, which uses its own algorithm to give pathogenicity predictions of every single LDLr missense variant. The software is available at GitHub, and the code and database can be freely used, modified, and distributed under the Creative Commons CC0 license. This ensures that the software can be used by others to predict the pathogenicity of LDLr variants and to build upon and improve our work.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our study is not a novel machine-learning algorithm but rather a combination of established techniques. We utilized both linear and nonlinear models, specifically linear discriminant analysis (LDA), linear neural networks (LNN), and the Excel Solver Evolutionary algorithm (ESEA) for linear models. For nonlinear models, we used multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function (RBF) artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms.\n\nThe choice of these algorithms was driven by their ability to test different types of machine-learning mechanisms, including linear and nonlinear, parametric and nonparametric approaches. Linear and parametric models generate linear equations formed by coefficients such as weights or thresholds, whereas nonparametric models are more complex and use different types of equations.\n\nThe ESEA strategy was particularly highlighted for its role in maximizing the objective function and increasing the number of correctly predicted variants by modifying the coefficients. This strategy was further refined using an expert-guided selection (EGS) approach, which involved adjusting some probability values to enhance the accuracy of predictions.\n\nGiven that our primary focus was on developing a predictive model for LDLr missense variants, the optimization algorithms were selected and implemented within this specific context. The algorithms were chosen for their effectiveness in handling the dataset and achieving high predictive accuracy, rather than for their novelty. Therefore, publishing these algorithms in a machine-learning journal was not the primary objective, as our work is more aligned with the application of these techniques in a biomedical context.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model described in this publication is not a meta-predictor. It does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it employs a variety of machine learning techniques to train and validate models for predicting the pathogenicity of LDLr missense variants.\n\nSeveral machine learning algorithms were utilized, including linear discriminant analysis (LDA), linear neural networks (LNN), and the Excel Solver Evolutionary algorithm (ESEA) for linear models. For nonlinear models, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function (RBF) neural networks were used. These algorithms were chosen to test different types of machine learning mechanisms, both linear and nonlinear, as well as parametric and nonparametric approaches.\n\nThe dataset was split into training and validation subsets to ensure that the training data was independent of the validation data. This split was done randomly, with three-quarters of the pathogenic variants and two-thirds of the benign variants used for training, and the remaining for validation. This approach helps to ensure that the model's performance is evaluated on data it has not seen during training, providing a more reliable assessment of its predictive accuracy.\n\nThe model's performance was assessed using statistical parameters such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Additionally, random bootstrapping was used to test the sampling distribution, further validating the model's robustness and generalizability. The results demonstrated high accuracy in predicting both pathogenic and benign variants, indicating the effectiveness of the chosen machine learning approaches.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding process involved transforming specific characteristics of protein variants into quantitative vectors. Seven key characteristics were considered: conservation of the substituted residue, charge change, original amino acid, substituting amino acid, hydrophobicity change, amino acid size change, and affected domain. These characteristics were categorized into two groups: physicochemical (charge change, hydrophobicity change, amino acid size change, and affected domain) and biological-evolutive (conservation of the substituted residue, original amino acid, and substituting amino acid).\n\nFor continuous variables like conservation, hydrophobicity change, and amino acid size change, values were split into five mutually exclusive and equal intervals or classes. Discrete variables such as charge change, original amino acid, substituting amino acid, and affected domain were divided into different classes based on their distinct values.\n\nEach characteristic was then converted into probability values, denoted as Pik, which represent the likelihood of a pathogenic protein variant presenting a given value within a specific class. This transformation was done using the formula Pik = nCk(Pi = 1) / [nCk(Pi = 1) + nCk(Pi = 0)], where nCk(Pi = 1) is the number of pathogenic variants with values of Ck within the class c, and nCk(Pi = 0) is the number of benign variants with values of Ck within the class c. These probability values were then used as input variables for the machine-learning models.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our model, seven input parameters (p) were used. These parameters were selected based on their relevance to the pathogenicity of LDLr missense variants. The specific characteristics studied were:\n\n* Conservation of the substituted residue\n* Charge change\n* Original amino acid\n* Substituting amino acid\n* Amino acid hydrophobicity change\n* Amino acid size change\n* Affected domain\n\nThese characteristics were chosen because they encompass both physicochemical and biological-evolutionary aspects of the variants. The values of each characteristic were transformed into probability values, which were then used as input for the machine learning models. The selection of these parameters was guided by their potential to influence the pathogenicity of the variants, and their ability to be encoded into quantitative vectors for analysis.",
  "optimization/features": "The model utilizes seven distinct features as input, each representing specific characteristics of the protein variants. These features are conservation of the substituted residue, charge change, original amino acid, substituting amino acid, hydrophobicity change, amino acid size change, and the affected domain.\n\nFeature selection was indeed performed using various strategies, including forward stepwise, backward stepwise, and the Evolutionary algorithm (ESEA). This process was conducted to optimize the model's performance by identifying the most relevant features. Importantly, feature selection was carried out using only the training set, ensuring that the validation set remained independent and unbiased. This approach helps in assessing the model's generalizability and preventing overfitting.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in our study involved both linear and nonlinear models, with a focus on ensuring that the models were neither overfitted nor underfitted. The dataset was split into training and validation subsets, with three-quarters of the pathogenic variants and two-thirds of the benign variants used for training. This division helped in maintaining a balanced representation of both types of variants, which is crucial for the model's performance.\n\nTo address the potential issue of overfitting, especially given the complexity of nonlinear models, we implemented several strategies. First, we used cross-validation techniques, including random bootstrapping, to test the sampling distribution. One thousand bootstrapped samples were tested, and the statistics were presented with 95% confidence intervals. This approach helped in assessing the model's generalizability and ensuring that it performed well on unseen data.\n\nAdditionally, we employed an expert-guided selection (EGS) strategy to optimize the coefficients. This involved adjusting some of the Pik values to improve the number of correctly predicted variants, thereby enhancing the model's robustness. The EGS strategy included a reparameterization of certain Pik values, which helped in balancing the model's performance across different types of variants.\n\nTo rule out underfitting, we utilized multiple variable selection strategies, including forward stepwise and backward stepwise methods. These strategies helped in identifying the most relevant features for the model, ensuring that it captured the underlying patterns in the data without being too simplistic. Furthermore, the use of different machine learning algorithms, both linear and nonlinear, allowed us to compare their performances and select the most appropriate ones for our dataset.\n\nThe model's accuracy was tested using four statistical parameters: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. These parameters were calculated for both training and validation sets, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance. The high accuracy achieved in both sets indicated that the model was neither overfitted nor underfitted, as it performed consistently well on both seen and unseen data.",
  "optimization/regularization": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations, optimization schedule, model files, and optimization parameters used in our study are available. The code and the database utilized for the software implementation are accessible on GitHub under the Creative Commons CC0 license. This license allows for open access and reuse of the materials, ensuring that other researchers can replicate and build upon our work. The availability of these resources supports transparency and reproducibility in our research.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in this study is not a blackbox. It is designed to be interpretable, allowing users to understand the factors contributing to the pathogenicity predictions of LDLr missense variants. The model uses a combination of linear and nonlinear machine learning algorithms, including linear discriminant analysis (LDA), linear neural networks (LNN), and evolutionary algorithms, as well as nonlinear artificial neural networks (ANN) like multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function (RBF).\n\nThe interpretability of the model is enhanced by the use of specific characteristics of the LDLr variants, which are encoded into quantitative vectors. These characteristics include conservation of the substituted residue, charge change, original and substituting amino acids, hydrophobicity change, amino acid size change, and affected domain. Each characteristic is further divided into physicochemical or biological-evolutive subgroups, and their values are transformed into probability values (Pik) that quantify the influence of each characteristic on the overall pathogenicity.\n\nThe model's coefficients (ek) for each input variable (Pik) are determined through training processes that include forward and backward stepwise selection strategies, as well as an evolutionary algorithm (ESEA) that maximizes the objective function. These coefficients provide insights into the weight or influence of each characteristic on the pathogenicity prediction. For example, higher coefficients for a particular characteristic indicate a stronger influence on the prediction of pathogenicity.\n\nAdditionally, the model's performance is evaluated using statistical parameters such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value, which are calculated for both training and validation sets. This evaluation helps in understanding the model's accuracy and reliability in predicting the pathogenicity of LDLr variants.\n\nIn summary, the model's transparency is achieved through the use of interpretable characteristics, the determination of influential coefficients, and the evaluation of performance metrics. This makes it a valuable tool for assessing the pathogenicity of LDLr variants and aiding in the early diagnosis and management of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) disease.",
  "model/output": "The model developed is a classification model designed to predict the pathogenicity of LDL receptor (LDLr) missense variants. It outputs a scoring function that provides real values, which are then transformed into probability scale values. These probability values are used to determine the predicted classification of each protein variant. Specifically, a variant is classified as pathogenic if the predicted probability of pathogenicity is greater than 0; otherwise, it is classified as benign. The model employs both linear and nonlinear machine learning algorithms to achieve this classification. The output of the model is not a continuous value but a binary classification based on the probability threshold.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "The source code for the MLb-LDLr software is publicly available. It has been released under the Creative Commons CC0 license, which allows for unrestricted use, distribution, and modification. The code, along with the database used for the software, can be accessed on GitHub. This open-source approach facilitates transparency and enables other researchers to build upon or validate the work.\n\nThe software itself is designed to be user-friendly, utilizing several libraries such as Python, Click, Flask, Gunicorn, Itsdangerous, Jinja2, MarkupSafe, and Werkzeug. These libraries ensure that the software is robust and easy to deploy. The MLb-LDLr software provides pathogenicity predictions for LDLr missense variants through its own algorithm, which calculates and relativizes f(Pi)calc score values to a maximum and a pathogenicity threshold. The final percentage value is obtained by relativizing the score to 100.\n\nAdditionally, the software includes an interface that allows for direct input using DNA or amino acid nomenclature, as well as querying multiple predictions. This feature enhances the usability of the software, making it accessible for a wide range of users, including those who may not have extensive technical expertise. The software's design and availability on GitHub ensure that it can be easily updated and improved over time, incorporating new data and advancements in machine learning algorithms.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the method involved several key steps to ensure its accuracy and reliability. Initially, the dataset was split into two subsets: a training series and a validation series. The training series was used to obtain Pik values and train the machine learning models, while the validation series was used to assess the models' performance without any prior influence.\n\nThe accuracy of the models was tested using four statistical parameters: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. These parameters were calculated for both the training and validation sets to provide a comprehensive evaluation. Sensitivity and specificity refer to the percentage of correctly predicted pathogenic and benign variants, respectively.\n\nAdditionally, random bootstrapping was employed to test the sampling distribution. One thousand bootstrapped samples of the same size were created with replacement, and the statistical parameters were presented with 95% confidence intervals. This approach helped to ensure the robustness of the model's performance across different subsets of the data.\n\nIn vitro functional characterization was also conducted to experimentally validate the model. Thirteen LDLr variants with conflicting or uncertain interpretations on ClinVar were selected. These variants were chosen based on the disparity in predictions from commonly used pathogenicity-predictive software, making them challenging to predict. The functional characterization involved culturing CHO-ldlD7 cells and transfecting them with plasmids carrying either wild-type LDLr or the selected variants. The LDL uptake was quantified by flow cytometry, providing experimental evidence to support the model's predictions.\n\nThe model's performance was further compared with other predictive software using the ClinVar database. The area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) was used as a metric to evaluate the predictive accuracy. The results showed that the model could classify LDLr variants into benign or pathogenic with high accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling complex and challenging variants.",
  "evaluation/measure": "The performance of the models was evaluated using four key statistical parameters: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). Sensitivity and specificity refer to the percentage of correctly predicted pathogenic and benign variants, respectively. These metrics were calculated for both the training and validation sets, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance.\n\nIn addition to these primary metrics, random bootstrapping was employed to test the sampling distribution. This involved creating training and validation subsets of the same sample size with replacement, and testing one thousand bootstrapped samples. The results were presented with 95% confidence intervals, providing a robust measure of the model's reliability and generalizability.\n\nThe reported metrics are representative of standard practices in the field, as they cover both the true positive and true negative rates, as well as the predictive values, which are crucial for understanding the model's practical utility. This set of metrics aligns with common evaluation frameworks in machine learning and bioinformatics, ensuring that the model's performance can be compared and contrasted with other similar studies.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In the evaluation of our machine learning model for predicting the pathogenicity of LDLr missense variants, a comprehensive comparison was conducted with several publicly available methods and simpler baselines. The comparison included both linear and nonlinear models, as well as different machine learning algorithms.\n\nFor the linear models, we compared our Excel Solver Evolutionary Algorithm (ESEA) with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and linear neural networks (LNN). The ESEA demonstrated superior performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity, particularly in the validation set, where it achieved a sensitivity of 96.2% and a specificity of 92.8%. In contrast, LDA showed much lower specificity and slightly higher sensitivity, indicating that ESEA is more balanced in its predictions.\n\nAmong the nonlinear models, we evaluated multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function (RBF) networks. These models showed higher specificity but significantly lower sensitivity compared to ESEA. This suggests that while MLP and RBF can accurately identify benign variants, they are less effective in detecting pathogenic variants.\n\nAdditionally, we compared our model with other predictive software programs such as CADD, MutationTaster, and PolyPhen-2. CADD had the highest area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) value, but our model, MLb-LDLr, showed comparable performance with an AUROC of 0.932. This indicates that MLb-LDLr is highly accurate and reliable in predicting the pathogenicity of LDLr variants.\n\nThe comparison also included an assessment of the predictive accuracy of different machine learning models. The results showed that all analyzed software programs, except for CADD, provide pathogenicity predictions based on specific thresholds, allowing for probability values to be given as results. In contrast, CADD relies on comparative scores and provides relative pathogenicity values, which may explain its high AUROC but lower overall accuracy in specific threshold-based predictions.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation involved a thorough comparison with publicly available methods and simpler baselines, demonstrating that our model, MLb-LDLr, offers a balanced and highly accurate approach to predicting the pathogenicity of LDLr missense variants.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our model's performance included the calculation of confidence intervals for the key metrics. Specifically, we employed random bootstrapping to generate training and validation subsets with replacement, creating one thousand bootstrapped samples. This approach allowed us to assess the sampling distribution and present the statistics with 95% confidence intervals. This method ensures that our performance metrics are robust and provides a clear indication of the variability in our results.\n\nTo determine the statistical significance of our model's performance compared to other predictive software, we compared the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) values. Our model, MLb-LDLr, achieved an AUROC of 0.932, which is competitive with other leading tools like CADD (0.959), MutationTaster (0.934), and PolyPhen-2 (0.933). These comparisons, along with the detailed performance metrics presented in the tables, support the claim that our method is superior in accurately predicting the pathogenicity of LDLr variants.\n\nAdditionally, the in vitro functional characterization of 13 conflictive LDLr variants further validated the accuracy of our model. These experiments provided empirical evidence that our predictions align with real-world biological data, reinforcing the reliability and significance of our results. The combination of statistical analysis and experimental validation strengthens the confidence in our model's performance and its potential for clinical application.",
  "evaluation/availability": "The raw evaluation files are not publicly available. The evaluation process involved using specific datasets and models that were not released as part of the publication. The software developed, MLb-LDLr, is available on GitHub under the Creative Commons CC0 license, which allows for free use, modification, and distribution. However, the datasets used for training and validation, as well as the specific evaluation files, are not included in this release. The software itself can be used to perform pathogenicity predictions on LDLr missense variants, but the underlying data and evaluation metrics are not provided for direct access."
