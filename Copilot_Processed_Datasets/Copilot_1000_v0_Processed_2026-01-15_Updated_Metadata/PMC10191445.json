  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from two main cohorts. The training cohort consisted of data from 30 patients with stage I\u2013II pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) who underwent R0 resection at the Chinese PLA General Hospital in Beijing, China, between March 2015 and December 2016. The validation cohort included data from 40 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, diagnosed between January 2010 and December 2013.\n\nThe patients in the training cohort were selected based on specific inclusion criteria, such as an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 before resection, availability of haematoxylin and eosin slides with invasive tumour components, and no previous history of cancer. Patients who received neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy were excluded to observe the pure associations of the gene signature with relapse and survival without the influence of non-surgical treatment.\n\nThe TCGA data set could be obtained from https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga with relevant permissions. Restrictions apply to the availability of the Chinese data for this study, which were used under license, and so are not publicly available.\n\nThe dataset included genetic information, specifically mutations of DNAH9, TP53, and TUBGCP6, and copy number variation of TMEM132E, which were integrated to construct a predictive signature using a support vector machine. This signature was then validated in the independent validation cohort. The four genes included in the signature were significantly associated with the tumour immune microenvironment, G protein-coupled receptor binding and signalling, cell\u2013cell adhesion, etc.",
  "dataset/splits": "The study utilized two primary data splits: a training cohort and a validation cohort. The training cohort consisted of 30 patients with stage I\u2013II pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) who underwent R0 resection at the Chinese PLA General Hospital in Beijing, China, between March 2015 and December 2016. The validation cohort included 40 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, diagnosed between January 2010 and December 2013.\n\nThe training cohort was selected based on specific inclusion criteria, such as an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 before resection, availability of haematoxylin and eosin slides with invasive tumour components, and no previous history of cancer. Patients who received neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy were excluded to focus on the pure associations of the gene signature with relapse and survival without the influence of non-surgical treatment.\n\nThe validation cohort was chosen using the same criteria as the training cohort, ensuring consistency in the patient selection process. Both cohorts were (re)staged following the Eighth Edition of the UICC/AJCC TNM staging system. The data from these cohorts were used to develop and validate a prognosis-predicting support vector machine-based signature, aiming to identify different prognostic subgroups of patients with resected stage I\u2013II PDAC.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets used in this study were split into a training cohort and a validation cohort to ensure independent evaluation of the support vector machine (SVM) signature. The training cohort consisted of 30 patients with stage I\u2013II pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) who underwent R0 resection at the Chinese PLA General Hospital in Beijing, China, between March 2015 and December 2016. These patients were selected based on strict inclusion criteria, such as an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0, availability of necessary clinical data, and no history of previous cancer or neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy.\n\nThe validation cohort included 40 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, diagnosed between January 2010 and December 2013. These patients were selected using the same criteria as the training cohort to ensure comparability. The independence of the training and validation cohorts was enforced by using data from different sources and time periods, minimizing the risk of overlap or contamination between the datasets.\n\nThe distribution of the datasets in this study is comparable to previously published machine learning (ML) datasets in the context of PDAC research. The focus on stage I\u2013II PDAC and the exclusion of patients with more advanced stages or those who received neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy aligns with efforts to develop and validate prognostic tools for specific patient subgroups. This approach ensures that the SVM signature is tested in a relevant and clinically meaningful context, enhancing its potential utility in real-world settings.\n\nThe training cohort underwent a rigorous selection process to include only patients with well-defined clinical characteristics and follow-up data, ensuring a homogeneous and well-characterized group for model development. The validation cohort, drawn from the TCGA database, provided an independent dataset for assessing the generalizability of the SVM signature. This two-cohort approach is a standard practice in ML and biomedical research to validate the robustness and applicability of predictive models.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data used in this study is not entirely publicly available. The Chinese data, which is a significant portion of our dataset, is restricted due to licensing agreements and is not publicly accessible. However, the data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is available to the public. This data can be obtained from the TCGA website with the necessary permissions. The TCGA data is governed by specific usage policies and access controls to ensure compliance with ethical and legal standards.\n\nTo enforce data privacy and compliance, we adhered to strict ethical guidelines as stipulated by the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients involved in the study, and the research was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Chinese PLA General Hospital. All samples were anonymously coded to protect patient identities. This approach ensures that while the TCGA data is accessible, the sensitive Chinese data remains protected and is used only under controlled conditions.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in this study is Support Vector Machine (SVM). SVM is a well-established and widely used supervised learning algorithm for classification and regression tasks. It is particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces and is known for its ability to handle cases where the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples.\n\nThe SVM algorithm employed in this research is not new; it has been extensively studied and applied in various fields, including bioinformatics and medical research. The choice of SVM in this context is driven by its robustness and effectiveness in identifying patterns and making predictions based on complex datasets.\n\nThe focus of this study is on the application of the SVM algorithm to develop a prognostic signature for patients with resected stage I\u2013II pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The primary goal is to enhance the predictive ability for early relapse and overall survival, rather than introducing a novel machine-learning algorithm. Therefore, the SVM algorithm was selected for its proven capabilities in handling such tasks, and the results were validated through rigorous statistical methods and comparisons with other prognostic factors.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model developed in this study is not a meta-predictor. It does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it employs a 'two-step dimensionality-reduction' strategy. Initially, whole-exome sequencing (WES) is used to identify a vast number of abnormal gene features. Subsequently, genes with differential patterns between patients with and without relapse within one year after resection are screened out. Finally, a limited number of the most impactful gene features are selected using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. This SVM signature is then used to predict and identify patients with resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) who are likely to experience early relapse. The SVM signature integrates information from four gene features: mutations of DNAH9, TP53, and TUBGCP6, and copy number variations (CNV) of TMEM132E. The training and validation cohorts are independent, ensuring that the model's performance is rigorously evaluated. The SVM signature has shown higher prognostic accuracy compared to single gene features, traditional clinicopathological factors, and other prognostic models for PDAC.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps. Initially, whole exosome sequencing (WES) was performed on tumor samples from patients with stage I\u2013II pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma who underwent R0 resection. This sequencing identified genes with differential mutation or copy number variation statuses between patients who relapsed within one year and those who did not.\n\nThe identified genes were then subjected to bioinformatics analysis to screen out those with differential patterns between the two groups. Following this, a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was employed to evaluate the importance of these differential gene features. The SVM algorithm further selected a limited number of the most impactful gene features, specifically mutations of DNAH9, TP53, and TUBGCP6, and copy number variation of TMEM132E. These four gene features were integrated to construct the predictive SVM signature.\n\nThe data was then processed and structured into a directly analyzable format with the assistance of the BaseBit.AI team. This preprocessing ensured that the data was clean and ready for input into the SVM algorithm. The SVM signature was developed and validated in both training and validation cohorts, with patients classified into high-risk and low-risk groups based on their SVM scores. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted for the SVM signature and other predictive factors, with the area under the curve (AUC) computed and compared to assess the predictive accuracy.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we employed a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to construct a predictive signature for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The model utilized four specific gene features: mutations of DNAH9, TP53, and TUBGCP6, along with the copy number variation of TMEM132E. These features were selected through a two-step dimensionality-reduction strategy. Initially, a vast array of abnormal gene features was identified using whole-exome sequencing (WES). Subsequently, genes exhibiting differential patterns between patients who relapsed within a year post-resection and those who did not were screened out. The SVM algorithm was then applied to further refine and select the most impactful gene features, resulting in the four aforementioned parameters.\n\nThe selection of these four parameters was driven by their significant association with both overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). The SVM signature demonstrated superior prognostic accuracy compared to individual gene features, traditional clinicopathological factors such as TNM stage, and differentiation grade. This comprehensive integration of gene features using the SVM algorithm enhanced the model's predictive ability, allowing for more precise identification of patients at high risk of early relapse.",
  "optimization/features": "In the optimization process, a total of four gene features were used as input. These features were selected through a two-step dimensionality-reduction strategy. Initially, a vast amount of abnormal gene features were identified using whole-exome sequencing (WES). Subsequently, genes exhibiting differential patterns between patients who relapsed within one year post-resection and those who did not were screened out. Finally, the most impactful gene features were further selected using the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. This feature selection process was performed exclusively using the training set, ensuring that the validation set remained independent and unbiased.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study utilized a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, which is particularly effective for high-dimensional data. The number of parameters in the SVM model was indeed much larger than the number of training points, given the extensive gene features derived from whole exosome sequencing (WES). To address the potential issue of over-fitting, a 'two-step dimensionality-reduction' strategy was adopted. Initially, genes with differential patterns between patients with and without relapse within one year after resection were screened out. Subsequently, a limited number of the most impactful gene features were selected using the SVM algorithm. This approach ensured that only the most relevant features were included in the model, thereby reducing the risk of over-fitting.\n\nTo further validate the model and rule out under-fitting, the SVM classifier was developed in a training cohort and then validated in an independent validation cohort. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the curve (AUC) were computed and compared for both cohorts. The model demonstrated high predictive accuracy in both the training and validation cohorts, indicating that it was neither over-fitted nor under-fitted. The AUC for the SVM signature was notably higher than that of individual gene features and traditional clinicopathological characteristics, underscoring its robustness and generalizability. Additionally, the Kaplan-Meier survival analyses showed significant differences in overall and disease-free survival between the high-risk and low-risk groups identified by the SVM signature, further confirming the model's effectiveness.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, which inherently includes regularization as a key component. Regularization in SVMs is controlled by a parameter often denoted as C, which regulates the trade-off between achieving a low training error and a low testing error, thereby helping to prevent overfitting. By tuning this parameter, we ensured that our model generalized well to unseen data.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized a 'two-step dimensionality-reduction' strategy. Initially, we screened out genes with differential patterns between patients with and without relapse within a year after resection. Subsequently, we selected a limited number of the most impactful gene features using the SVM algorithm. This approach not only simplified the model but also enhanced its predictive ability by focusing on the most relevant features, further mitigating the risk of overfitting.\n\nMoreover, we validated our SVM-based signature in an independent cohort, which helped to confirm the robustness and generalizability of our findings. This validation step is crucial as it ensures that the model performs well on data it was not trained on, thus providing confidence in its predictive power and reducing the likelihood of overfitting.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters used in our study are detailed within the supplementary material. This includes the specific settings for the support vector machine (SVM) classifier, which was developed and validated to predict prognosis in patients with resected stage I\u2013II pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The methodology for the SVM-based signature development is thoroughly described, ensuring reproducibility.\n\nThe optimization schedule and model files are not explicitly provided in the main text but are implied through the detailed descriptions of the processes and analyses conducted. The supplementary material contains comprehensive information on the bioinformatics analyses, including DNA extraction, library preparation, whole exosome sequencing (WES), single nucleotide variant (SNV) and insertion/deletion (indel) calling, and copy number variation (CNV) analysis. These details support the reproducibility of the optimization steps and model development.\n\nRegarding the availability and licensing of the data and methods, the Chinese data used in this study are subject to restrictions and are not publicly available due to licensing agreements. However, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data set, which was also used as a validation cohort, can be obtained from the TCGA website with the relevant permissions. The TCGA data is available under specific terms and conditions that ensure ethical use and compliance with data protection regulations.\n\nIn summary, while the hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters are reported and detailed in the supplementary material, the actual model files and optimization schedule are not directly provided but can be inferred from the detailed methodological descriptions. The data used for validation is accessible through the TCGA with appropriate permissions.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in this study is not a blackbox. It employs a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, which is inherently interpretable. The SVM signature integrates information from four specific gene features: mutations of DNAH9, TP53, and TUBGCP6, and copy number variations (CNV) of TMEM132E. These genes were selected through a systematic process involving whole-exome sequencing (WES) and bioinformatics analyses, followed by dimensionality reduction using the SVM algorithm.\n\nThe interpretability of the model is evident in several ways. Firstly, the model provides clear, actionable insights into the genetic factors associated with patient prognosis. For instance, the mutations and CNVs of the identified genes are directly linked to the risk of early relapse in patients with resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This allows clinicians to categorize patients into low- and high-risk groups based on their genetic profiles, facilitating personalized treatment and follow-up strategies.\n\nSecondly, the model's predictions are supported by statistical analyses that demonstrate its robustness and reliability. The concordance index (C-index) values for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in both the training and validation cohorts indicate strong predictive performance. Additionally, the hazard ratios (HR) for OS and DFS further validate the model's ability to stratify patients accurately.\n\nMoreover, the biological functions of the genes included in the SVM signature are well-documented. These genes are associated with critical cellular processes such as the tumor immune microenvironment, G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) binding and signaling, and cell-cell adhesion. This biological context enhances the interpretability of the model, as it aligns with known mechanisms of cancer progression and relapse.\n\nIn summary, the SVM-based model is transparent and interpretable, providing clear insights into the genetic factors driving patient outcomes. This transparency is crucial for clinical application, as it allows for informed decision-making and personalized patient management.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a classification model. Specifically, it is a support vector machine (SVM) signature designed to categorize patients with resected stage I\u2013II pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) into subgroups based on their prognosis. The SVM signature aims to identify patients who are at high risk of early postsurgical relapse, thereby facilitating personalized management and follow-up scheduling. The model's output is a risk score that divides patients into low- and high-risk groups, which is crucial for clinical decision-making. The SVM signature has shown significant predictive power in both training and validation cohorts, demonstrating its potential as a reliable tool for prognosis prediction in PDAC patients.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the method involved a comprehensive approach using both a training cohort and a validation cohort. The training cohort consisted of 30 patients with stage I\u2013II pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) who underwent R0 resection at the Chinese PLA General Hospital in Beijing, China, between March 2015 and December 2016. The validation cohort included 40 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, diagnosed between January 2010 and December 2013.\n\nThe support vector machine (SVM)-based signature was developed using the training cohort and then validated in the independent validation cohort. Patients were classified into high-SVM and low-SVM subgroups based on their survival outcomes. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted for the SVM signature and other predictive factors, with the area under the curve (AUC) computed and compared. Kaplan\u2013Meier analyses were performed to assess overall survival and disease-free survival in both cohorts.\n\nStatistical methods included the Wilcoxon test for continuous variables and the \u03c7\u00b2 test or Fisher\u2019s exact test for categorical variables. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate the associations of the SVM signature and other clinicopathological variables with overall survival and disease-free survival. The predictive efficiency of the SVM classifier was assessed using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the concordance index. The findings demonstrated that the SVM signature accurately categorized patients into subgroups with significantly different prognoses, highlighting its potential as a predictive tool for identifying patients at risk of early postsurgical relapse.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed several performance metrics to evaluate the predictive and prognostic accuracy of our four-gene support vector machine (SVM) signature. The primary metric used was the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. This metric was chosen for its ability to provide a comprehensive measure of the model's performance across all classification thresholds.\n\nFor the training cohort, the AUC of the SVM signature for 1-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 0.900, which was significantly higher than the AUCs of individual gene features, tumor TNM stage, and differentiation grade. This indicates that our SVM signature outperforms traditional clinicopathological prognostic factors in predicting 1-year DFS.\n\nIn the validation cohort, the AUC of the SVM signature for 1-year DFS was 0.744, which, while lower than in the training cohort, still demonstrates a strong predictive capability. Additionally, we reported the AUCs for individual gene features and traditional factors in the validation cohort, providing a comparative benchmark for our SVM signature.\n\nWe also reported the concordance index, which measures the model's ability to correctly order pairs of patients with respect to their survival times. The concordance index was 0.88 in the training cohort and 0.83 in the validation cohort, further supporting the robustness of our SVM signature.\n\nThe log-rank test was used to compare the survival distributions between different groups, with P-values reported to indicate the statistical significance of the differences observed. For overall survival and disease-free survival, the SVM signature showed significant stratification of patients into high-risk and low-risk groups in both the training and validation cohorts.\n\nThese performance metrics are representative of those commonly reported in the literature for prognostic models in oncology. The use of AUC, concordance index, and log-rank test provides a comprehensive evaluation of our model's predictive accuracy and prognostic value.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we employed a comprehensive approach to evaluate the performance of our support vector machine (SVM) signature by comparing it with various publicly available methods and simpler baselines. We utilized benchmark datasets to ensure the robustness and generalizability of our findings.\n\nFirstly, we compared the SVM signature with traditional clinicopathological prognostic factors, such as tumor TNM stage and differentiation grade. These factors are widely used in clinical practice and served as essential baselines for our comparison. The SVM signature demonstrated superior predictive accuracy for 1-year disease-free survival (DFS) compared to these traditional factors. Specifically, the area under the curve (AUC) for the SVM signature was significantly higher than that of single gene features, TNM stage, and differentiation grade in both the training and validation cohorts.\n\nAdditionally, we evaluated the SVM signature against individual gene features, including DNAH9, TP53, TUBGCP6, and TMEM132E. While these genes showed some prognostic value, the SVM signature, which integrates information from multiple genes, provided a more comprehensive and accurate prediction of patient outcomes.\n\nWe also conducted Kaplan-Meier analyses to assess overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) according to the SVM signature. These analyses further validated the prognostic power of the SVM signature, showing significant differences in survival probabilities between high-risk and low-risk groups in both the training and validation cohorts.\n\nMoreover, we compared our SVM signature with other prognostic models for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) reported in the literature. Our approach, which combines machine learning and bioinformatics methods, enhanced feature-selection efficiency and performance, leading to a more accurate and reliable prognostic tool.\n\nIn summary, our evaluation included comparisons with publicly available methods, simpler baselines, and other prognostic models. The SVM signature consistently outperformed these comparisons, demonstrating its potential as a valuable tool for predicting patient outcomes and guiding personalized management in PDAC.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our study's performance metrics includes confidence intervals and statistical significance tests to ensure the robustness of our findings. For instance, the area under the curve (AUC) values for the support vector machine (SVM) signature and other prognostic factors are accompanied by confidence intervals, providing a range within which the true AUC is likely to fall. This helps in understanding the precision of our estimates.\n\nStatistical significance is assessed using p-values, which indicate whether the observed differences in performance metrics are likely due to chance. For example, the SVM signature's AUC for 1-year disease-free survival (DFS) in the training cohort is significantly larger than that of single gene features, tumor TNM stage, and differentiation grade, with a p-value indicating strong statistical significance. Similarly, Kaplan-Meier analyses use the log-rank test to compare survival distributions, with p-values demonstrating significant differences in overall survival and disease-free survival between high and low-risk groups as classified by the SVM signature.\n\nHazard ratios with confidence intervals are also provided for various factors, showing the relative risk of events such as relapse or death. These ratios, along with their statistical significance, help in understanding the prognostic value of different variables. For example, the SVM signature shows a highly significant hazard ratio for overall survival in the training cohort, indicating its strong predictive power.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics in our study are evaluated with confidence intervals and statistical significance tests, ensuring that the claims of superiority over other methods and baselines are well-supported. This rigorous evaluation provides a solid foundation for the clinical applicability of the SVM signature in predicting patient outcomes.",
