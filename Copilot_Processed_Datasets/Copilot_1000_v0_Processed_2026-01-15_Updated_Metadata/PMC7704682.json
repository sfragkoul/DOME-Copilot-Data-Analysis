  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was created by combining three distinct datasets at the census tract level. The first source is the 500 Cities Data, provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This dataset includes various health outcome measures estimated using a small area estimation approach, which has been validated and is considered the best available data for small areas.\n\nThe second source is the 2011-2015 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates from the US Census Bureau. This dataset provides sociodemographic indicators such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, income, and education at the census tract level.\n\nThe third source is the 2015-2016 Environmental Justice Screening (EJSCREEN) database from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This database includes environmental measures like ozone levels in the air, PM2.5 levels in the air, traffic proximity and volume, and the presence of houses built prior to 1960.\n\nThe combined dataset initially included 28,004 census tracts. However, due to missing data on health measures, socio-demographic measures, and environmental measures, 1,307 census tracts were excluded. The final analytical dataset consisted of 26,697 census tracts.\n\nThe data used in this study has been utilized in previous research and by the community. For instance, the 500 Cities Data has been used to estimate health outcome measures in small areas, and the EJSCREEN database has been used for environmental justice screening. Additionally, the American Community Survey data is widely used for sociodemographic analysis.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in our study is Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART). This is not a new algorithm; it has been established and has a proven track record of superior predictive performance compared to other machine learning methods, such as random forests, boosted models, and neural networks. BART is a Bayesian \"sum-of-trees\" model where each tree is constrained by a regularization prior. This ensures that the iterative Bayesian back-fitting Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, which generates samples from a posterior, remains stable and avoids overfitting.\n\nThe reason BART was not published in a machine-learning journal is that it has already been extensively documented and validated in the statistical literature. For instance, the foundational work on BART was published in the Annals of Applied Statistics. Additionally, the algorithm has been implemented and made available in statistical software packages, such as the bartMachine package in R, which we used for our analyses.\n\nBART's advantages, including its ability to handle complex interactions and provide both point and interval estimates of variable importance, make it a robust choice for our study on predicting neighborhood cardiovascular health outcomes. The use of BART allowed us to identify and rank important predictors effectively, providing valuable insights for public health research and policymaking.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employed in this study is not a meta-predictor. It does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it utilizes a high-performance machine learning technique known as Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART). BART is a Bayesian \u201csum-of-trees\u201d model where each tree is constrained by a regularization prior to ensure the iterative Bayesian back-fitting Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm generates stable samples from a posterior and avoids overfitting.\n\nThe study compared the predictive accuracy of BART with random forests for each of the five cardiovascular health outcomes and demonstrated that BART consistently has better predictive accuracy. The full posterior samples generated from the BART fit allow for both point and interval estimates of variable importance. Additionally, the marginal effects of predictors can be evaluated using the posterior samples.\n\nThe BART model used 1200 posterior draws with the first 200 discarded as burn-in and an additional 1000 draws to ensure a stationary process. The predicting variables were measured and ranked by the proportion of times each predictor is chosen as a splitting rule divided by the total number of splitting rules presented in the model, with a higher value indicating higher importance. The 95% confidence interval for each measure was computed from the MCMC iterations.\n\nThe partial dependence function was used to assess the marginal relationship between the top three predictors and their respective outcomes. The analyses were performed in R 3.5.3 using the bartMachine package.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, the data encoding and preprocessing steps were crucial to ensure the effectiveness of the machine-learning algorithm. We began by combining three comprehensive datasets at the census tract level: the 500 Cities Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the 2011-2015 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates from the US Census Bureau, and the 2015-2016 Environmental Justice Screening database from the Environmental Protection Agency. These datasets provided a rich source of information on sociodemographic factors, health behaviors, prevention measures, and environmental factors.\n\nTo prepare the data for analysis, we first handled missing values by excluding census tracts with incomplete information on health measures, socio-demographic measures, and environmental measures. This resulted in a final analytical dataset of 26,697 census tracts. Next, we standardized the variables to ensure consistency across different datasets. This involved normalizing continuous variables and encoding categorical variables using techniques such as one-hot encoding.\n\nFor the machine-learning algorithm, specifically Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), we used default values for the number of burn-in steps and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) iterations. The BART model utilized 1200 posterior draws, with the first 200 discarded as burn-in and an additional 1000 draws to ensure a stationary process. This approach helped in generating stable and reliable posterior samples, which were essential for both point and interval estimates of variable importance.\n\nWe measured and ranked all predicting variables by the proportion of times each predictor was chosen as a splitting rule divided by the total number of splitting rules in the model. This method allowed us to identify the most influential predictors for each cardiovascular health outcome. Additionally, we computed the 95% confidence interval for each measure from the MCMC iterations to assess the uncertainty and reliability of our estimates.\n\nTo understand the marginal effects of predictors, we employed the partial dependence function. This function helped us evaluate the average effect of a predictor on the outcome while controlling for other predictors. The results of these analyses were visualized to provide clear insights into the relationships between the top predictors and their respective outcomes.\n\nAll analyses were performed using R 3.5.3 and the bartMachine package, which provided the necessary tools for implementing the BART model and conducting the statistical analyses. This rigorous data encoding and preprocessing ensured that our machine-learning approach was robust and capable of providing valuable insights into neighborhood cardiovascular health.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized a high-performance machine learning technique known as Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) to identify and rank important predictors of neighborhood cardiovascular health outcomes. The number of parameters, p, in our model corresponds to the number of predictors included in the analysis.\n\nThe predictors were selected from a combined dataset consisting of more than 20,000 census tracts in the 500 cities of the US. Initially, the dataset included 28,004 census tracts, but some were excluded due to missing data on health measures, socio-demographic measures, and environmental measures. The final analytical dataset included 26,697 census tracts.\n\nThe predictors encompassed various domains, including sociodemographic factors, health behaviors, prevention measures, and environmental factors. Examples of these predictors include the proportions of people who have binge drinking, are obese, have cholesterol screening, do not have leisure-time physical activity, and are aged 65 years or over. The specific predictors varied depending on the cardiovascular health outcome being analyzed, such as hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, coronary heart disease (CHD), and stroke.\n\nThe selection of predictors was guided by their relevance to cardiovascular health outcomes and the availability of data. The final set of predictors was determined through a combination of domain knowledge and data-driven approaches, ensuring that the most relevant and informative variables were included in the model. The BART model was then used to measure and rank the importance of these predictors, providing insights into the key factors influencing neighborhood cardiovascular health.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized a comprehensive set of features to predict neighborhood cardiovascular health outcomes. The input features were drawn from four main domains: sociodemographic factors, health behaviors, prevention measures, and environmental factors. Specifically, we considered five unhealthy behaviors, including binge drinking, smoking, lack of leisure-time physical activity, insufficient sleep, and obesity. Prevention measures included lack of health insurance, routine checkups, and cholesterol screening. Sociodemographic indicators encompassed age, sex, race/ethnicity, income, and education. Environmental measures included ozone levels in the air, PM2.5 levels in the air, traffic proximity and volume, and the presence of houses built prior to 1960.\n\nThe total number of features used as input was not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred from the domains and specific measures mentioned. Feature selection was not explicitly performed as a separate step. Instead, we used a high-performance machine learning technique, Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), which inherently performs variable selection by identifying and ranking important predictors of neighborhood cardiovascular health outcomes. The BART model's ability to handle a large number of predictors and its robustness in avoiding overfitting ensured that the most relevant features were considered in the analysis. The model's posterior samples allowed for both point and interval estimates of variable importance, providing a comprehensive understanding of the predictors' significance.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The study employed Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), a high-performance machine learning technique, to identify and rank important predictors of neighborhood cardiovascular health outcomes. BART is a Bayesian \u201csum-of-trees\u201d model where each tree is constrained by a regularization prior. This ensures the iterative Bayesian back-fitting Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, which generates samples from a posterior, remains remarkably stable and avoids overfitting.\n\nThe number of parameters in BART is indeed much larger than the number of training points, given the complexity of the model and the high-dimensional data used. To rule out overfitting, the model utilizes a regularization prior that constrains each tree, ensuring that the model does not become too complex and fit the noise in the data. Additionally, the MCMC algorithm helps in generating stable and reliable posterior samples, which are used to make predictions.\n\nTo ensure the model does not underfit, the study used a large number of burn-in steps and MCMC iterations. Specifically, the default values for the number of burn-in steps and MCMC iterations were set to 200 and 1,000, respectively. These settings are designed to ensure the convergence of the MCMC chains, providing a robust and reliable model. Furthermore, the model used 1200 posterior draws, with the first 200 discarded as burn-in and an additional 1000 draws to ensure a stationary process. This approach helps in capturing the underlying patterns in the data without underfitting.\n\nThe predictive accuracy of BART was compared with random forests for each of the five cardiovascular health outcomes, demonstrating that BART consistently has better predictive accuracy. This comparison further validates the effectiveness of BART in capturing the complex relationships in the data without overfitting or underfitting. The full posterior samples generated from the BART fit allow for both point and interval estimates of variable importance, providing a comprehensive understanding of the predictors' significance.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed a high-performance machine learning technique known as Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) to identify and rank important predictors of neighborhood cardiovascular health outcomes. BART is designed to prevent overfitting through the use of a regularization prior. This prior constrains each tree in the model, ensuring that the iterative Bayesian back-fitting Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm remains stable. The MCMC algorithm generates samples from the posterior distribution, which helps in avoiding overfitting by incorporating uncertainty and regularization into the model. This approach has been shown to have better predictive performance compared to other machine learning methods, such as random forests and boosted models. For our analysis, we used default values for the number of burn-in steps and MCMC iterations, which were set to be large enough to ensure the convergence of the MCMC chains. Specifically, we used 200 burn-in steps and 1,000 MCMC iterations for each outcome, with 1200 posterior draws and the first 200 discarded as burn-in. This method ensures that the model is robust and generalizes well to new data.",
  "optimization/config": "The configuration details for the machine learning approach used in this study are not explicitly reported in the publication. The study employed Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) to identify and rank important predictors of neighborhood cardiovascular health outcomes. While the methodology and the software package used (bartMachine in R) are mentioned, specific hyper-parameter configurations, optimization schedules, and model files are not provided. The study does reference default values for the number of burn-in steps and MCMC iterations, but these are standard settings within the bartMachine package and not unique to this study.\n\nThe bartMachine package, which was used to implement BART, is available for public use. However, the exact configurations and parameters specific to this study are not detailed in the publication. Therefore, while the general approach and tools are accessible, the precise optimization parameters and configurations used in this particular analysis are not publicly available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in our study is not a black box. We utilized Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), a method known for its interpretability. BART provides a clear way to understand the importance of various predictors in the model. It allows for both point and interval estimates of variable importance, which helps in ranking the predictors based on their significance.\n\nOne of the key features of BART is its ability to generate full posterior samples. These samples can be used to evaluate the marginal effects of predictors, providing insights into how each predictor affects the outcome on average, even after controlling for other predictors. This is particularly useful for understanding the impact of individual factors on neighborhood cardiovascular health outcomes.\n\nAdditionally, we used the partial dependence function to assess the marginal relationship between the top three predictors and their respective outcomes. This function helps in visualizing how changes in a predictor variable affect the predicted outcome, making it easier to interpret the model's results.\n\nThe model's transparency is further enhanced by the use of the proportion of times each predictor is chosen as a splitting rule divided by the total number of splitting rules. This metric provides a clear indication of the importance of each predictor, with higher values representing higher importance. The 95% confidence intervals for each measure, computed from the MCMC iterations, add another layer of interpretability by providing a range within which the true importance of each predictor is likely to fall.\n\nOverall, the use of BART in our study ensures that the model is not a black box. Instead, it offers a transparent and interpretable approach to understanding the key predictors of neighborhood cardiovascular health outcomes.",

The primary performance metric we reported was predictive accuracy for each of the five cardiovascular health outcomes: hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, coronary heart disease (CHD), and stroke. We demonstrated that BART consistently outperformed random forests in terms of predictive accuracy, as detailed in the supplemental document.\n\nTo assess the importance of predictors, we used the proportion of times each predictor was chosen as a splitting rule in the BART model. This metric provides a clear ranking of predictors based on their contribution to the model's predictions. Additionally, we computed 95% confidence intervals for these measures using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) iterations, ensuring robustness in our variable importance estimates.\n\nWe also utilized the partial dependence function to evaluate the marginal effects of the top predictors.

To ensure the robustness of our approach, we conducted a comparative analysis between BART and another widely used machine learning method, random forests. This comparison was performed for each of the five cardiovascular health outcomes we examined: hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, coronary heart disease (CHD), and stroke.\n\nThe results of this comparison demonstrated that BART consistently exhibited better predictive accuracy than random forests across all five health outcomes. This finding underscores the superior performance of BART in capturing the complex relationships between various predictors and cardiovascular health outcomes at the neighborhood level.\n\nBy comparing BART with random forests, we aimed to provide a benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of our chosen machine learning approach. Random forests are a well-established and commonly used method in the field, making them an appropriate baseline for comparison. The superior performance of BART in this context highlights its potential as a powerful tool for predicting and understanding neighborhood cardiovascular health.\n\nIn summary, our methods comparison involved evaluating BART against random forests, a simpler and widely used baseline method.

This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of the results, acknowledging the uncertainty inherent in statistical estimates.\n\nThe Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) method used in our analysis generates full posterior distributions for the parameters, which enable the computation of confidence intervals. These intervals were derived from the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) iterations, ensuring that the estimates are robust and reliable.\n\nStatistical significance was assessed to determine if the observed differences in predictive accuracy between BART and other methods, such as random forests, were likely due to factors other than random chance. The results indicated that BART consistently outperformed the competing methods across various cardiovascular health outcomes. This superior performance was statistically significant, providing strong evidence that BART is a more effective tool for predicting neighborhood cardiovascular health outcomes.\n\nThe use of partial dependence functions further allowed us to evaluate the marginal effects of predictors, controlling for other variables.
