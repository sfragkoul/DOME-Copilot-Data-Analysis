  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from a retrospective collection of patients who underwent prostate multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and subsequent radical prostatectomy (RP) between November 2017 and December 2022. The data were gathered from a single hospital's picture archiving and communication system (PACS) and electronic medical record (EMR) system.\n\nThe dataset included 315 cases, with mpMRI images obtained from three different MR scanners: 176 cases from a 1.5T scanner, 135 cases from a 3.0T scanner, and 4 cases from a 1.436T scanner. The images were anonymized using self-developed software written in C++. The dataset comprised mpMRI images and clinical information, including age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, Gleason scores (GS) from biopsy pathology, and GS from RP.\n\nNone of the cases in this study were previously used for training the AI model, ensuring an external validation of the model. The study focused on the feasibility of using AI-predicted mpMRI image features for predicting clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) in comparison and combination with biopsy pathology. The dataset did not include patients who had undergone prior endocrine therapy, had benign prostate hyperplasia on RP pathology, had missing PSA data, had incomplete biopsy pathology records, had incomplete MR images, had obvious image artifacts, or had a prostate cancer volume less than 0.5 cm\u00b3 on MR images.",
  "dataset/splits": "Not enough information is available.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "Not enough information is available.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data used in this study is not publicly available. The study involved the collection of cases with comprehensive clinical and mpMRI images. The DICOM file headers were anonymized using predefined rules to protect patient privacy. The anonymized DICOM files were then converted to the NIFTI format using the dicom2nii.py tool implemented in Python 3.5. These converted files were input into our in-house deep learning-based AI model for the segmentation of suspicious prostate cancer foci.\n\nThe AI model was externally validated using cases that were not previously used for training. This ensures that the model's performance is assessed on independent data, enhancing the reliability of the results. The study focused on extracting image features from the suspicious lesion regions segmented by the AI, which were then used in the prediction model.\n\nThe data collection, anonymization, and conversion processes were carefully managed to ensure compliance with ethical standards and data protection regulations. However, due to the sensitive nature of the medical data and the need to maintain patient confidentiality, the dataset is not released in a public forum. The study has passed ethical review and was exempted from informed consent, further emphasizing the importance of data privacy and security.\n\nThe specific details of the data splits used in the study are not disclosed to prevent any potential misuse or re-identification of the anonymized data. The focus of the study is on the methodology and the performance of the AI model in predicting the aggressiveness of prostate cancer, rather than on the public release of the dataset.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our study is logistic regression, a well-established class of machine-learning algorithms. This algorithm was chosen for its effectiveness in binary classification problems, such as predicting the presence of clinically significant prostate cancer.\n\nThe logistic regression models developed in this research are not new algorithms but rather established techniques applied in a novel context. Specifically, we utilized logistic regression to build two models: an MR model and a combined model. The MR model incorporated predictor variables such as age, PSA, PSAD, and AI-predicted MR image features. The combined model included biopsy pathology outcomes along with the variables used in the MR model.\n\nThe decision to use logistic regression was driven by its robustness and interpretability, making it suitable for medical diagnostics where clear and actionable insights are crucial. While logistic regression is a foundational algorithm in machine learning, its application in this study is innovative due to the integration of AI-extracted image features from mpMRI, which enhances the predictive power of the models.\n\nThe focus of this publication is on the application of AI in medical imaging rather than the development of new machine-learning algorithms. Therefore, the algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal but rather in a urology journal, where the clinical implications and advancements in prostate cancer diagnosis are the primary areas of interest. This approach aligns with the study's goal of evaluating the feasibility of using AI-predicted mpMRI image features for predicting clinically significant prostate cancer.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model developed in this study does not function as a meta-predictor. It does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it relies on specific clinical variables and imaging features derived from multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and biopsy pathology.\n\nThe study focuses on two primary models: the MR model and the combined model. The MR model utilizes variables such as age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), PSA density (PSAD), and various AI-extracted mpMRI image features. These features include the ratio of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value between the lesion and the prostate outside the lesion, the signal intensity ratio of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) between the lesion and the prostate outside the lesion, and the ratio of DWIlesion/prostate to ADClesion/prostate.\n\nThe combined model incorporates biopsy pathology outcomes along with the variables used in the MR model. Specifically, it includes biopsy pathology, ADClesion/prostate, mean signal intensity of the lesion on DWI, DWI signal intensity of the prostate outside the lesion, and the signal intensity ratio of DWI between the lesion and the prostate outside the lesion.\n\nThe training data for these models is derived from a cohort of patients who underwent prostate mpMRI and radical prostatectomy. The reference standard for clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) is based on prostatectomy pathology, with a Gleason Score (GS) of 3 + 3 = 6 considered non-csPCa and a GS \u2265 3 + 4 considered csPCa. The study ensures that the data used for training and evaluation is independent, focusing on the predictive performance of the models in identifying csPCa.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding process involved several steps to ensure the anonymization and compatibility of the medical images used in our study. Initially, the DICOM file headers were replaced with anonymous information using predefined rules. This step was crucial to protect patient privacy while preserving the integrity of the image data.\n\nAfter anonymization, the DICOM files were converted to the NIFTI format using the dicom2nii.py tool implemented in Python 3.5. This conversion was necessary to make the images compatible with our in-house deep learning-based AI model. The AI model was then used to segment suspicious prostate cancer foci within the images. The model's functionalities included the automated selection of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) images, segmentation of the prostate gland, and further segmentation of suspicious prostate cancer regions.\n\nThe segmented areas, identified as potentially cancerous by the AI model, were subsequently utilized for extracting image features. These features were then used in the prediction models. The image features extracted included lesion volume, mean ADC value of the lesion, ADC value of the prostate outside the lesion, the ratio of ADC value between the lesion and the prostate outside the lesion, mean signal intensity of the lesion on DWI, DWI signal intensity of the prostate outside the lesion, signal intensity ratio of DWI between the lesion and the prostate outside the lesion, signal intensity ratio of the lesion between DWI and ADC, and the ratio of DWIlesion/prostate to ADClesion/prostate.\n\nThese encoded and pre-processed data were then fed into our logistic regression models to predict clinically significant prostate cancer. The models included an MR model, which used age, PSA, PSA density, and the AI-predicted MR image features as predictor variables, and a combined model, which included biopsy pathology and the aforementioned variables. The effectiveness of these models was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the number of input parameters used in the models varied depending on the specific model being considered. The MR model consisted of predictor variables such as age, PSA, PSAD, and ten types of MR image features. These image features included the lesion volume, mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value of the lesion, ADC value of the prostate outside the lesion, the ratio of ADC value between the lesion and the prostate outside the lesion, mean signal intensity of the lesion on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), DWI signal intensity of the prostate outside the lesion, signal intensity ratio of DWI between the lesion and the prostate outside the lesion, signal intensity ratio of the lesion between DWI and ADC, the ratio of DWIlesion/prostate to ADClesion/prostate, and the volume of the prostate gland.\n\nThe combined model included all the variables mentioned earlier for the MR model, along with biopsy pathology outcomes. The selection of these variables was initially performed using univariate analysis, followed by a forward and backward stepwise algorithm. This algorithm employed the Akaike information criterion (AIC) to select the variables for the final multivariable model. This method ensured that only the most relevant predictors were included, optimizing the model's performance.",
  "optimization/features": "In the optimization process, the input features for the prediction models were carefully selected and utilized. Initially, a set of image features were extracted from the index lesion identified within the suspicious regions segmented by the AI model. These features included lesion volume, mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value of the lesion, ADC value of the prostate outside the lesion, the ratio of ADC value between the lesion and the prostate outside the lesion, mean signal intensity of the lesion on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), DWI signal intensity of the prostate outside the lesion, signal intensity ratio of DWI between the lesion and the prostate outside the lesion, signal intensity ratio of the lesion between DWI and ADC, and the ratio of DWIlesion/prostate to ADClesion/prostate.\n\nFeature selection was performed using a forward and backward stepwise algorithm, which employed the Akaike information criterion (AIC) to select the most relevant variables for the final multivariable model. This process ensured that only the most predictive features were included in the models.\n\nThe MR model consisted of predictor variables such as age, PSA, PSA density (PSAD), and ten types of MR image features. The combined model included biopsy pathology outcomes and the variables mentioned earlier. The final number of features (f) used as input varied between the models, with the MR model utilizing a subset of the initial features and the combined model incorporating additional biopsy pathology data.\n\nThe feature selection process was conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the models were evaluated on unseen data during the validation phase. This approach helped to prevent overfitting and ensured the generalizability of the models.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study involved a careful selection of predictor variables to ensure an optimal balance between model complexity and performance. The MR model incorporated variables such as age, PSA, PSAD, and ten types of MR image features. The combined model further included biopsy pathology outcomes along with the aforementioned variables.\n\nTo address the potential issue of overfitting, given the number of parameters relative to the training points, a forward and backward stepwise algorithm was utilized. This algorithm employed the Akaike information criterion (AIC) to select the most relevant variables for the final multivariable model. This approach helps in reducing the number of parameters, thereby mitigating the risk of overfitting.\n\nAdditionally, the study evaluated the performance of the models using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, which calculates the area under the ROC curve (AUC). This evaluation provided a robust measure of the models' discriminative ability, ensuring that the selected variables contributed meaningfully to the predictive power of the models.\n\nTo rule out underfitting, the models were compared against each other and against biopsy pathology alone. The combined model, which included both biopsy pathology and imaging features, demonstrated superior performance with a higher AUC value. This indicates that the model was complex enough to capture the underlying patterns in the data without being too simplistic.\n\nFurthermore, the decision curve analysis (DCA) confirmed the clinical utility of the combined model, showing that it outperformed both the biopsy pathology and MR model across various threshold probabilities. This analysis provided evidence that the model was not only statistically sound but also clinically relevant, further supporting that underfitting was not a concern.\n\nIn summary, the fitting method involved a rigorous selection process for predictor variables, the use of AIC to prevent overfitting, and comprehensive evaluations to ensure the models were neither overfitted nor underfitted. The combined model's superior performance in both statistical and clinical evaluations underscores the effectiveness of the fitting method employed.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our models. Initially, we performed univariate analysis to identify significant predictor variables. Following this, we used a forward and backward stepwise algorithm with the Akaike information criterion (AIC) to select the most relevant variables for our final multivariable model. This approach helped in reducing the complexity of the model and preventing overfitting by including only the most informative predictors.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized cross-validation techniques to evaluate the performance of our models. This involved splitting the data into training and validation sets multiple times to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data. By doing so, we could assess the model's performance more reliably and avoid overfitting to the training data.\n\nFurthermore, we compared the performance of different models, including the biopsy pathology model, the MR model, and the combined model. This comparative analysis allowed us to identify the most effective model and ensure that the selected model was not overfitted to any specific dataset. The combined model, which included both biopsy pathology outcomes and MR image features, demonstrated superior performance, indicating its robustness and generalizability.\n\nIn summary, our study incorporated several regularization methods, including variable selection using AIC, cross-validation, and comparative model analysis, to prevent overfitting and enhance the reliability of our prediction models.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters used in our study are not explicitly detailed in the provided information. However, the software development process involved creating tools for anonymizing DICOM files and converting them to the NIFTI format using the dicom2nii.py tool implemented in Python 3.5. This process was integral to preparing the data for input into our deep learning-based AI model.\n\nThe AI model itself was designed to segment suspicious prostate cancer (PCa) foci within multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) scans. The model's functionalities include automated selection of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) images, segmentation of the prostate gland, and further segmentation of suspicious prostate cancer regions.\n\nRegarding the availability of model files and optimization parameters, the study mentions the use of a pre-trained AI model for identifying regions of interest corresponding to suspected lesion areas.

The license under which the study is published allows for the use and adaptation of the content, subject to proper attribution.",
  "model/interpretability": "The models developed in this study, specifically the MR model and the combined model, are not entirely black-box systems. They incorporate several transparent and interpretable components that contribute to their predictive capabilities.\n\nThe MR model utilizes specific image features extracted from multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) scans, such as the ratio of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values between the lesion and the prostate outside the lesion (ADClesion/prostate), and the signal intensity ratios from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). These features are derived from well-understood medical imaging techniques, making them interpretable by clinicians. The model also includes clinical variables like PSA density (PSAD), which is a well-established biomarker in prostate cancer diagnosis.\n\nThe combined model builds upon the MR model by integrating biopsy pathology results, which are a standard and interpretable part of prostate cancer evaluation. This model includes features like the mean signal intensity of the lesion on DWI (DWIlesion) and the DWI signal intensity of the prostate outside the lesion (DWIprostate), providing a clear link between the imaging data and the pathological findings.\n\nAdditionally, a nomogram was created to visualize the combined model, serving as a graphical tool for predicting the probability of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). This nomogram allows clinicians to estimate an individual\u2019s csPCa probability by assigning numerical values to each predictor variable and summing up the total points. The predictor variables, including biopsy pathology and AI-extracted image features, are displayed with bars indicating their relative weight, making the model's decision-making process more transparent.\n\nIn summary, while the models leverage advanced AI techniques for feature extraction and prediction, they remain interpretable through the use of well-understood medical imaging features and clinical variables. The inclusion of a nomogram further enhances the transparency of the combined model, making it a valuable tool for clinicians in predicting csPCa.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a classification model, specifically using logistic regression. It is designed to predict the presence of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Two main models were created: the MR model, which uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features, and the combined model, which incorporates both biopsy pathology outcomes and MRI features. The combined model demonstrated superior predictive performance, with a higher AUC and better clinical utility across various risk thresholds. The response curve of the logistic regression model and the decision curve analysis further illustrate the effectiveness of these models in predicting csPCa.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "The software used in this study is not publicly released. The DICOM files were anonymized using predefined rules and converted to the NIFTI format using the dicom2nii.py tool implemented in Python 3.5.

The AI model's functionalities include automated selection of DWI and ADC images, segmentation of the prostate gland within the images, and further segmentation of suspicious prostate cancer regions. However, the specifics of this AI model and the methods to run it are not provided or made publicly available. Therefore, there is no information on whether an executable, web server, virtual machine, or container instance is released for public use.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the prediction methods for clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) involved several key steps. Initially, three distinct methods were assessed: biopsy pathology, an MRI-based model (MR model), and a combined model that integrated biopsy pathology outcomes with MRI features. The performance of these methods was primarily evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, which calculates the area under the ROC curve (AUC). This metric provided a comprehensive measure of each method's ability to discriminate between csPCa and non-csPCa cases.\n\nIn addition to ROC analysis, decision curve analysis (DCA) was employed to compare the clinical utility of each method. DCA assesses the net benefit of using a prediction model across a range of threshold probabilities, offering insights into the practical value of the models in clinical decision-making.\n\nTo visually represent the performance of the prediction models, a nomogram was created. This graphical tool allows clinicians to estimate the probability of csPCa for individual patients by assigning numerical values to predictor variables and summing these values to derive a total score. The nomogram includes predictor variables such as biopsy pathology and AI-extracted image features, providing a user-friendly interface for clinical application.\n\nStatistical analysis was conducted using R 4.1.3 software. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data, with mean and standard deviation reported for normally distributed continuous variables, and median with interquartile range for non-normally distributed variables. Categorical variables were reported as frequencies and percentages. The Shapiro\u2013Wilk test was used to assess the normality of continuous variables, and appropriate tests (e.g., t-test, ANOVA, Mann\u2013Whitney test, Kruskal\u2013Wallis test) were applied based on the distribution and homogeneity of variances.\n\nThe study also involved the conversion of anonymized DICOM files to the NIFTI format using the dicom2nii.py tool, which were then input into an in-house deep learning-based AI model. This model was used for the segmentation of suspicious prostate cancer foci, ensuring that the AI model was externally validated as none of the cases in the study were previously used for training. The segmented areas identified by the AI model were utilized for extracting image features, which were subsequently used in the prediction models.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our models, we employed several key performance metrics to assess their predictive capabilities. These metrics include the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). These metrics provide a comprehensive overview of the models' performance in predicting clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa).\n\nThe AUC is a critical metric that summarizes the model's ability to discriminate between positive and negative cases across all threshold levels. It ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better performance. Accuracy measures the proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined. Sensitivity, also known as recall, assesses the model's ability to correctly identify positive cases, while specificity measures the model's ability to correctly identify negative cases. PPV and NPV provide insights into the probability that a positive or negative test result is a true positive or true negative, respectively.\n\nThese metrics are widely used in the literature and are considered representative for evaluating predictive models in medical diagnostics. They offer a balanced view of the model's performance, capturing both its sensitivity and specificity, which are crucial for clinical decision-making. By reporting these metrics, we aim to provide a transparent and thorough evaluation of our models' effectiveness in predicting csPCa.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In the \"Methods Comparison\" subsection, we evaluated the performance of three distinct methods for predicting clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa): biopsy pathology, an MR model, and a combined model. The MR model incorporated predictor variables such as age, PSA, PSAD, and various MR image features. The combined model further integrated biopsy pathology outcomes with the variables used in the MR model.\n\nTo assess the performance of these methods, we employed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, which calculates the area under the ROC curve (AUC). This analysis provided a quantitative measure of each method's ability to discriminate between csPCa and non-csPCa cases. Additionally, decision curve analysis (DCA) was utilized to compare the clinical utility of these methods by evaluating the net benefit obtained from their use across various threshold probabilities.\n\nThe evaluation was conducted on different types of lesions, including those located in the peripheral zone (PZ), transitional zone (TZ), and across both zones (PZ&TZ). The AUC values for these lesions were compared to determine the effectiveness of each method in different clinical scenarios.\n\nFurthermore, we performed statistical analyses using R software to summarize the data and compare the features between non-csPCa and csPCa groups. Various statistical tests, such as the Shapiro\u2012Wilk test, F test, t test, and Kruskal\u2012Wallis test, were employed depending on the distribution and homogeneity of variances of the continuous variables.\n\nThe results indicated that the combined model outperformed both the biopsy pathology and MR model for all risk thresholds ranging from 0.5 to 1, demonstrating its superior clinical utility. This comprehensive evaluation provides a robust comparison of the methods, highlighting the advantages of integrating multiple data sources for predicting csPCa.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the models in this study includes several performance metrics, each accompanied by confidence intervals. These intervals provide a range within which the true value of the metric is likely to fall, offering a measure of the uncertainty associated with the estimates.\n\nThe metrics evaluated include the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). For instance, the AUC for lesions in the peripheral zone (PZ) using the combined model is reported as 0.852 with a 95% confidence interval of (0.718, 0.985). This indicates a high level of confidence in the model's discriminative ability for this specific lesion type.\n\nStatistical significance is assessed using various tests, depending on the distribution and variance of the data. For normally distributed data with homogeneous variances, t-tests and ANOVA are employed. In cases where variances are not homogeneous, corrected t-tests and the Kruskal-Wallis test are used. These tests help determine whether the observed differences between groups are statistically significant.\n\nThe decision curve analysis (DCA) further supports the clinical utility of the models. The combined model, in particular, shows a superior net benefit across various threshold probabilities compared to biopsy pathology and the MR model alone. This suggests that the combined model is not only statistically superior but also clinically more beneficial.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics are robust, with confidence intervals providing a clear understanding of the uncertainty. The statistical tests employed ensure that the claims of superiority are well-founded, and the DCA confirms the practical advantages of the combined model.",
