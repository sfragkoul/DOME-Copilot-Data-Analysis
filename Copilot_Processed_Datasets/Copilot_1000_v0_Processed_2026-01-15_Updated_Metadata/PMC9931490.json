  "dataset/provenance": "The datasets utilized in this study were sourced from the TCGA database and the GEO datasets. Specifically, we obtained CNVs and somatic mutations from the TCGA database. Additionally, we downloaded expression and clinical information from the GEO datasets, which included GSE22153, GSE54467, and GSE65904. The GSE22153 dataset consists of 54 samples, the GSE54467 dataset includes 79 samples, and the GSE65904 dataset comprises 188 samples after eliminating those with incomplete prognostic information.\n\nThese datasets have been used in previous studies. For instance, GSE22153 was used to identify molecular subtypes in stage IV melanomas with different clinical outcomes. GSE54467 was employed to determine prognosis in metastatic melanoma through the integration of clinico-pathologic, mutation, mRNA, microRNA, and protein information. GSE65904 was utilized to study tertiary lymphoid structures and their impact on immunotherapy and survival in melanoma.\n\nThe datasets were chosen for their relevance to melanoma research and the availability of comprehensive clinical and molecular data. They provide a robust foundation for analyzing pyroptosis-associated profiles, immune pathway activities, and prognostic predictions in melanoma.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset utilized in this study includes multiple splits for training and testing purposes. The primary training set was derived from the TCGA database, which includes a comprehensive collection of genetic variations, copy number variations (CNVs), and somatic mutations. Additionally, expression and clinical information were obtained from GEO datasets as test sets. These test sets include:\n\n* GSE22153 with 54 samples\n* GSE54467 with 79 samples\n* GSE65904 with 188 samples\n\nThe GSE65904 dataset was further refined by eliminating samples that had incomplete prognostic information. The samples from these datasets were used to validate the constructed prognostic pyroptosis-related score (PPRS) model. The validation process involved dividing the samples into low- and high-score groups to assess the survival differences between these groups. For instance, in the GSE65904 cohort, 94 samples were divided into low- and high-score groups, and similar divisions were made for the GSE54467 and GSE22153 cohorts. The survival differences between these groups were found to be significant, indicating the effectiveness of the PPRS model in prognosis prediction.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "Not enough information is available.",
  "dataset/availability": "The dataset used in this study is publicly available. The specific datasets utilized are GSE22153, GSE54467, and GSE65904, which can be accessed through the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The links to these datasets are provided as follows:\n\n* GSE22153: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE22153](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE22153)\n* GSE54467: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE54467](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE54467)\n* GSE65904: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE65904](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE65904)\n\nThese datasets are available for public use, allowing other researchers to verify and build upon the findings presented in this study.

  "optimization/algorithm": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model described in this publication is not a meta-predictor. It does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it relies on a constructed Prognostic Pyroptosis-Related Signature (PPRS) to predict prognosis. The PPRS was developed using specific genes and their expression profiles, and it was validated using multiple external test sets. The model's effectiveness was evaluated using metrics such as AUC values and the concordance index (C-index), demonstrating its robustness and clinical utility. The training data for the PPRS was independent, as it was derived from distinct cohorts and validated through separate test sets, ensuring the integrity and reliability of the prognostic predictions.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing involved several steps to prepare the gene expression profiles for analysis. Gene expression profiles were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and converted into Transcripts Per Million (TPM) values. This conversion was done using the formula TPMi = FPKMi \u00d7 1000000/ (FPKM0 + ... + FPKMm), where i stands for gene i, and m is the total number of genes. This normalization method ensures that the expression levels are comparable across different samples.\n\nAdditionally, copy number variations (CNVs) and somatic mutations were obtained from the TCGA database. Expression and clinical information from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets were also downloaded and used as test sets. These datasets included GSE22153, GSE54467, and GSE65904, with samples that had incomplete prognostic information being eliminated.\n\nPyroptosis-associated markers, suppressive, and driver genes were identified by searching the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) using the keyword \"REACTOME_PYROPTOSIS.\" After removing duplicates, 27 candidate pyroptosis-regulated genes were selected for further analysis. These genes were used to construct pyroptosis-associated profiles among skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) cases using single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) with the \"GSVA\" package in R. The critical parameters for ssGSEA included min.sz = 1, kcdf = \"Gaussian,\" abs.ranking = TRUE, tau = 0.25, and max.sz = Inf. The ssGSEA enrichment scores represent the degree of upregulation or downregulation of genes in the samples.\n\nThe stemness index, which measures how similar tumor cells are to stem cells, was calculated using the one-class logistic regression (OCLR) algorithm. This index ranges from 0 (lowest stemness) to 1 (highest stemness), indicating the strength of stem cell properties in the tumor cells.\n\nImmune pathway activities, immune infiltration levels, and immunotherapeutic response were assessed using the ESTIMATE algorithm to calculate tumor purity and ESTIMATE/stromal/immune scores for each melanoma sample. The CIBERSORT algorithm was used to estimate the infiltration degrees of diverse immune cells within the tumor microenvironment (TIME). Immunotherapeutic response was analyzed using the immunophenoscore (IPS), which considers four main immunogenicity-determining gene classes: immunosuppressive cells, effector cells, immunomodulators, and MHC molecules. The IPS was obtained from The Cancer Immunome Atlas (TCIA) and ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater immunogenicity.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized a model that incorporates 8 specific genes. These genes were selected through a process involving univariate Cox regression and LASSO regression. Initially, univariate Cox regression was performed to identify prognostic genes, resulting in 984 genes. Subsequently, LASSO regression was applied to reduce the dimensionality and identify the most significant genes. The optimal number of genes was determined by evaluating the deviance, with the smallest deviance achieved when 8 genes were included in the model. The selected genes are GBP2, HPDL, FCGR2A, IFITM1, HAPLN3, CCL8, TRIM34, and GRIPAP1. These genes were used to calculate the PPRS, which serves as a prognostic risk score for SKCM patients.",
  "optimization/features": "In the optimization process, the input features were initially selected through a series of statistical analyses. Univariate Cox regression was performed on clinical prognostic data to identify significant genes, resulting in 984 prognostic genes. To reduce dimensionality and prevent overfitting, LASSO regression was then applied to these genes. The LASSO algorithm identified 8 genes that achieved the smallest deviance, indicating the optimal number of features for the model. These 8 genes\u2014GBP2, HPDL, FCGR2A, IFITM1, HAPLN3, CCL8, TRIM34, and GRIPAP1\u2014were used as input features for further analysis.\n\nFeature selection was indeed performed, and it was conducted using the training set only. This ensures that the model's performance on the test sets is a true reflection of its generalizability, as the feature selection process did not involve any information from the test sets. The selected genes were then used to calculate the PPRS (Pyroptosis-Related Prognostic Risk Score), which was subsequently validated on external test sets to confirm its prognostic value.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed a LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression approach to handle the scenario where the number of parameters was much larger than the number of training points. This method is particularly useful for high-dimensional data, as it performs both variable selection and regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the statistical model it produces.\n\nTo rule out over-fitting, we utilized the LASSO algorithm, which applies L1 regularization. This process shrinks some of the coefficient estimates to zero, effectively performing feature selection and reducing the model complexity. We determined the optimal lambda value, which controls the amount of shrinkage, by minimizing the deviance. Specifically, we found that when the model included 8 genes, the smallest deviance was achieved, indicating the best trade-off between bias and variance.\n\nTo ensure that the model was not under-fitting, we carefully selected the lambda value through cross-validation. The lambda value of 0.1092 was chosen because it provided a good balance between model simplicity and predictive accuracy. Additionally, we validated the model using separate training and test sets, ensuring that it generalized well to unseen data.\n\nThe final model included 8 genes: GBP2, HPDL, FCGR2A, IFITM1, HAPLN3, CCL8, TRIM34, and GRIPAP1. These genes were selected based on their significant prognostic value as determined by univariate Cox regression and further refined through LASSO regression. The Prognostic Pyroptosis-Related Score (PPRS) was calculated using the coefficients derived from the LASSO regression, providing a robust prognostic tool for predicting outcomes in skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) patients.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression to prevent overfitting. This technique is particularly useful for high-dimensional data, as it performs both variable selection and regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the statistical model it produces.\n\nLASSO regression adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients to the loss function. This penalty shrinks some coefficient estimates to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection by excluding variables that do not contribute significantly to the model. By doing so, LASSO helps in reducing the complexity of the model and mitigating the risk of overfitting.\n\nIn our analysis, we integrated the results from univariate Cox regression into LASSO regression. The lambda parameter, which controls the amount of shrinkage, was tuned to achieve the smallest deviance, indicating the best model fit. This process resulted in a model with eight genes, which were found to have the most significant prognostic value. The use of LASSO regression ensured that our prognostic prediction risk score (PPRS) was robust and generalizable, minimizing the likelihood of overfitting to the training data.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters used in our study are reported within the publication. Specifically, for the Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA), we detailed the cluster threshold, \u03b2-value, and median absolute deviation, as well as the parameters used for converting the expression matrix into a topology matrix and obtaining modules. These include height, deep split, and minimum module size.\n\nFor the establishment and estimation of the Pyroptosis-Related Risk Score (PPRS), we described the process of screening prognostic pyroptosis-associated genes (PAGs) using a P < 0.01 threshold, followed by univariate and LASSO Cox regression to establish the PPRS. The specific genes and their coefficients in the PPRS formula are provided.\n\nThe statistical analyses, including the use of Fisher\u2019s exact test, chi-square test, Wilcoxon tests, Student\u2019s t-tests, ANOVA, and Kruskal-Wallis test, are also outlined, along with the software and packages used, such as R software (version 3.5.3) and specific R packages like survival, survminer, glmnet, and rms.\n\nThe data used, including gene expression profiles from TCGA and GEO datasets, as well as the pyroptosis-associated markers obtained from the MSigDB database, are mentioned. However, the exact model files and optimization schedule are not explicitly detailed in the text provided. The publication does not specify the availability of these files or the license under which they might be shared.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in this study is not a black-box but rather a transparent and interpretable one. The Prognostic Pyroptosis-Related Score (PPRS) is constructed using a combination of weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) and LASSO Cox regression. This approach ensures that the model's predictions are based on clear, biologically meaningful factors.\n\nFirstly, WGCNA was used to identify key coexpression modules related to pyroptosis-associated profiles. This method clusters genes with similar expression patterns, providing insights into the underlying biological processes. The genes within these modules are then screened for their prognostic significance using a univariate Cox regression analysis.\n\nNext, LASSO Cox regression was employed to establish the PPRS. LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is a regression analysis method that performs both variable selection and regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the statistical model it produces. It selects a subset of the most relevant genes, reducing the risk of overfitting and making the model more interpretable.\n\nThe PPRS is calculated based on the expression levels of these selected genes and their corresponding regression coefficients. This score is then normalized using Z-score, allowing for the classification of patients into high-risk and low-risk groups. The transparency of the model is further enhanced by the use of a nomogram, which integrates the PPRS with other clinical variables to predict patient outcomes. The nomogram provides a visual representation of the model, making it easier for clinicians to understand and apply.\n\nAdditionally, the model's interpretability is supported by the analysis of the relationships between PPRS and various clinical characteristics, oncogenic mutations, immune infiltration degrees, and biological processes. This comprehensive analysis helps to elucidate the biological significance of the PPRS and its potential as a prognostic tool.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is primarily a regression model, specifically designed for prognosis prediction. It utilizes a Prognostic Pyroptosis-Related Score (PPRS) to assess the risk of patients. The PPRS is calculated using a formula that incorporates the expression levels of eight specific genes, each with its respective regression coefficient. This score is then used to classify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups based on their Z-scores.\n\nThe model's performance is evaluated using time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (t-ROC) curves, which measure the area under the curve (AUC) for predicting overall survival at 1, 3, and 5 years. Additionally, survival curves are plotted using the Kaplan-Meier approach, and statistical differences between groups are analyzed using the log-rank test. These evaluations indicate that the model has a good discriminative ability and calibration, as shown by the calibration curves approaching the optimal 45-degree line.\n\nThe model also includes a nomogram, which is a graphical representation of the regression model. It integrates significant variables to provide a visual tool for predicting patient outcomes. The nomogram's accuracy is further validated through calibration analysis and decision curve analysis (DCA), demonstrating its practical utility in clinical settings.\n\nIn summary, the model is a regression-based prognostic tool that uses gene expression data to predict patient outcomes, classify risk groups, and provide a visual prediction tool through a nomogram.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the method involved several steps to ensure its robustness and effectiveness in prognosis prediction. Initially, the constructed PPRS was assessed using Kaplan-Meier (KM) curve analysis, which demonstrated a significant difference in survival between high-risk and low-risk groups. The hazard ratio (HR) and confidence intervals (CI) further supported the prognostic value of the PPRS.\n\nTo validate the PPRS, three external test sets were utilized. These sets included samples from different cohorts, such as GSE65904, GSE54467, and GSE22153. The samples were divided into low-score and high-score groups, and the survival differences between these groups were found to be significant. The area under the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (t-ROC) curves (AUC) values for predicting overall survival (OS) at 1, 3, and 5 years ranged from 0.66 to 0.95 across the test sets, indicating strong predictive performance.\n\nAdditionally, the method's effectiveness was evaluated by analyzing associations between the PPRS and various clinical characteristics, oncogenic mutations, immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) contents, immune infiltration degrees, biological processes, and treatment response. Statistical tests such as Wilcoxon's rank sum test were employed to assess these associations, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the PPRS's clinical relevance.\n\nThe nomogram constructed based on the discovered factors was evaluated using ROC curves and calibration curves. These evaluations confirmed the discriminating ability and calibration of the nomogram, further validating the method's reliability in prognosis prediction.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our prognostic prediction model for skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), several performance metrics were employed to assess its effectiveness. The primary metric reported is the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the time-dependent Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, which was used to predict overall survival (OS) at 1, 3, and 5 years. These AUC values provide a measure of the model's ability to discriminate between high-risk and low-risk patients across different time horizons.\n\nAdditionally, the Hazard Ratio (HR) and its 95% Confidence Interval (CI) were reported to quantify the relative risk of events between the high-risk and low-risk groups. The log-rank test was used to compare the survival distributions of these groups, with p-values indicating the statistical significance of the observed differences.\n\nThe Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves were plotted to visualize the survival probabilities over time for the high-risk and low-risk groups, further illustrating the model's prognostic capability. The p-values associated with these curves, derived from the log-rank test, provide a measure of the statistical significance of the survival differences between the groups.\n\nThe set of metrics used in this study is representative of those commonly reported in the literature for evaluating prognostic models in oncology. The AUC values at multiple time points offer a comprehensive view of the model's performance over time, while the HR and log-rank test results provide insights into the relative risk and statistical significance of the survival differences. Together, these metrics offer a robust evaluation of the model's prognostic accuracy and its potential clinical utility.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In the evaluation of our prognosis prediction model for SKCM, a comprehensive comparison was conducted with publicly available methods. Specifically, three reported prognosis prediction models were selected for comparison: a 4-gene signature, a 12-gene signature, and a 5-gene signature. These models were chosen to benchmark our constructed PPRS (Pyroptosis-Related Prognostic Risk Score) model.\n\nThe gene expression data from TCGA-SKCM samples were utilized to calculate the RiskScore for each sample in each of the prognosis prediction models. Subsequently, the RiskScore was transformed into a Z-score, allowing for the classification of samples into high-risk (Z-score \u2265 0) and low-risk (Z-score < 0) groups. The difference in overall survival (OS) between these two groups was then calculated and analyzed.\n\nThe performance of the models was evaluated using ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) and KM (Kaplan-Meier) curves. The results indicated that all three benchmark models had lower ROC values compared to our PPRS model. Additionally, the difference in OS between the high- and low-risk groups was statistically significant for all models, but the PPRS model demonstrated superior predictive ability.\n\nTo further quantify the predictive performance, the C-index (concordance index) was used. The C-index of the PPRS model was found to be higher than that of the other three risk models, confirming its superior predictive accuracy.\n\nIn summary, the comparison with publicly available methods and simpler baselines demonstrated that our PPRS model is a relatively reasonable, effective, and clinically convenient prognosis prediction model for SKCM, utilizing a relatively fewer number of genes.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation confidence of the presented methods is supported by several key statistical measures. Performance metrics, such as the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for different time frames, are accompanied by confidence intervals. These intervals provide a range within which the true AUC value is expected to lie, offering a measure of uncertainty around the point estimates. For instance, the AUC values for 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival probabilities are reported with their respective 95% confidence intervals, indicating the reliability of these estimates.\n\nStatistical significance is assessed through various tests, including the log-rank test and hazard ratios (HR) with confidence intervals. Significant p-values, such as those less than 0.05, suggest that the observed differences in survival probabilities between groups are unlikely to have occurred by chance. Hazard ratios, along with their confidence intervals, quantify the effect size, showing how the risk of an event differs between groups. For example, HR values with confidence intervals that do not include 1 indicate a statistically significant difference in risk.\n\nAdditionally, the Kruskal-Wallis test and Wilcoxon tests are used to compare distributions and medians between groups, further validating the statistical significance of the findings. These tests help ensure that the observed differences are not due to random variation but reflect true underlying differences between the groups being compared.\n\nOverall, the evaluation confidence is robust, with multiple statistical measures supporting the superiority of the methods over baselines and other comparisons. The inclusion of confidence intervals and significant p-values strengthens the claims made about the performance and effectiveness of the presented approaches.",
  "evaluation/availability": "The raw evaluation files used in our study are not publicly available. The data utilized for our analyses were obtained from various sources, including the TCGA database for CNVs and somatic mutations, and GEO datasets for expression and clinical information. These datasets were used to construct and validate our prognostic models, including the PPRS and nomogram. While the specific raw evaluation files are not released, the methods and datasets used are described in detail within the publication, allowing for reproducibility of the analyses. The study adheres to ethical guidelines and data usage policies, ensuring that sensitive patient information remains protected."
