  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset utilized in this study was derived from echocardiographic images, specifically contrast-enhanced echocardiographic images. The analysis focused on evaluating myocardial viability, with a particular emphasis on detecting necrotic tissue. The images were processed to select the most informative red component for further evaluation.\n\nThe dataset consisted of samples categorized into different viability grades, with a notable imbalance in the number of samples across these grades. Specifically, there were 775 samples in viability grade 0, 4 samples in grade 1, 43 samples in grade 2, 77 samples in grade 3, 44 samples in grade 4, and 32 samples in grade 5. This imbalance was addressed by dividing all segments in the 17th segment model into two smaller regions of interest (ROIs).\n\nThe dataset was analyzed using various machine learning models, including multilayer perceptron (MLP), nonlinear discriminant analysis (NDA), and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers with both polynomial and radial basis function kernels. The performance of these models was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness and generalization.\n\nThe results of the analysis were correlated with information from cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) to determine the degree of tissue necrosis, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the dataset's effectiveness in predicting myocardial viability. The study confirmed the best detection of necrotic tissue in groups 3 and 4, indicating the potential of the dataset and the applied methods for advanced prognostic tools in cardiovascular disease.",
  "dataset/splits": "The study utilized a 5-fold cross-validation approach for assessing the quality of classifiers. This means the dataset was divided into five splits, with each split containing a different subset of the data. The final results of the classifiers' metrics were calculated as the average value of the five obtained results from these testing splits. This method ensures that the model's performance is evaluated across different subsets of the data, providing a more robust assessment of its generalization capabilities. The specific distribution of data points in each split is not detailed, but the use of 5-fold cross-validation implies that each fold contains approximately 20% of the data, with the model trained on the remaining 80% and then tested on the 20% held out. This process is repeated five times, with each fold serving as the test set once.",

These are well-established algorithms in the field of machine learning and have been widely used for classification tasks.\n\nThe algorithms employed are not new; they have been extensively studied and applied in various domains. The choice of these algorithms was driven by their proven effectiveness in handling complex classification problems, particularly in medical imaging. The SVM with polynomial and radial basis function kernels, for instance, is known for its ability to handle high-dimensional spaces and is effective in cases where the relationship between classes is non-linear.\n\nThe decision to use these established algorithms rather than proposing a new one was influenced by the specific requirements of the study. The focus was on evaluating the performance of these algorithms in the context of myocardial viability assessment using echocardiographic images. The study aimed to leverage the strengths of these algorithms to achieve accurate classification and prediction of myocardial function recovery.\n\nThe results obtained from these algorithms were correlated with information from cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) to determine the optimal analysis method. The study found that the neural network approach, particularly using the red component of contrast-enhanced images, provided high accuracy in classifying regions based on heart viability and predicting myocardial function recovery. This indicates that the chosen algorithms are well-suited for the task at hand and do not necessitate the development of a new algorithm.\n\nThe algorithms were implemented using established software packages, such as Weka for MLP, SVM, and AdaBoost, and MaZda for texture feature evaluation and NDA classification. These tools are widely recognized and have been used in numerous research studies, ensuring the reliability and reproducibility of the results.\n\nIn summary, the machine-learning algorithms used in this study are well-established and have been chosen for their proven effectiveness in classification tasks.

The results demonstrate the utility of these algorithms in achieving accurate and reliable predictions in the context of medical imaging.",
  "optimization/meta": "The study employs a meta-predictor approach, leveraging multiple machine learning algorithms to enhance the prediction of myocardial viability. Specifically, the AdaBoost algorithm is utilized, which integrates decision trees as \"weak\" classifiers. This ensemble method aims to improve predictive accuracy by combining the strengths of multiple models.\n\nThe AdaBoost algorithm works by sequentially training decision trees, where each new tree focuses on correcting the errors made by the previous ones. This iterative process helps in creating a robust model that can better generalize from the training data.\n\nRegarding the independence of the training data, it is implied that the data used for training the individual classifiers within the AdaBoost framework are independent. This independence is crucial for the effectiveness of the ensemble method, as it ensures that each classifier contributes unique information to the final prediction.\n\nThe study also mentions the use of other machine learning algorithms such as Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Nonlinear Discriminant Analysis (NDA), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with different kernels (polynomial and radial basis functions). These algorithms are used for feature classification and prediction, providing a comprehensive approach to analyzing echocardiographic images for myocardial viability.\n\nIn summary, the meta-predictor in this study is built using the AdaBoost algorithm, which incorporates decision trees. The training data for these classifiers are independent, ensuring that the ensemble method can effectively improve predictive performance.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the machine-learning algorithm, the data encoding and preprocessing involved several steps to ensure optimal performance. Initially, contrast-enhanced echocardiographic images were analyzed by selecting the most informative red component for further evaluation. This selection was crucial for capturing relevant texture features.\n\nA co-occurrence matrix evaluation was performed at distances ranging from 1 to 5 pixels and in four directions: horizontal, vertical, diagonal, and anti-diagonal. This method helped in capturing the spatial relationships between pixels, which are essential for texture analysis.\n\nTo address the issue of significant low counts in certain viability classes, the myocardium was divided into smaller regions of interest (ROIs). This division allowed for a more detailed and accurate analysis of the tissue characteristics.\n\nTexture features were selected using a two-step procedure. First, among 283 texture parameters, those with the lowest variability were identified. This was achieved by calculating the normalized standard deviation for each feature across all image ROIs. The 30 features with the lowest variability were then selected. In the second step, further reduction was done using the Fisher criterion and algorithms designed to minimize misclassification and average correlation coefficient. This process ensured that the selected features were uncorrelated and minimized classification error.\n\nThe final set of 10 to 13 features was used as input for the neural networks, including multilayer perceptron (MLP), nonlinear discriminant analysis (NDA), and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers with polynomial and radial basis function kernels. Decision trees were also used as \"weak\" classifiers in the AdaBoost algorithm to predict parameter values assessing post-infarction myocardial viability.\n\nThe preprocessing and encoding steps were performed using MaZda 5.2 software for texture feature evaluation and selection, while the prediction of myocardial function recovery was done using the Weka 3.8 package. The results were validated using 5-fold cross-validation to ensure the robustness and reliability of the classifiers.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the number of input parameters used in the model ranged from 10 to 13. These parameters were selected through a two-stage feature selection process. Initially, we evaluated 283 texture parameters and chose those with the lowest variability, as indicated by the normalized standard deviation. This step resulted in a selection of 30 features. In the second stage, we further reduced this set using the Fisher criterion and the POE + ACC method, which minimizes both the probability of misclassification and the average correlation coefficient between the selected parameters. This process ensured that the final set of features had limited variability within the analyzed classes, contained uncorrelated features, and minimized classification error. The final selection of 10 to 13 features was used as input for the neural networks and other classifiers in our analysis.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, the input features for the neural networks consisted of 10 to 13 texture parameters. These features were selected through a rigorous two-stage process to ensure optimal performance and minimal classification error.\n\nFirst, we evaluated 283 texture parameters and selected those with the lowest variability. This was achieved by calculating the normalized standard deviation for each feature across all image regions of interest (ROIs) and different viability grades. The 30 features with the lowest variability were chosen for further analysis.\n\nIn the second stage, we further reduced the number of features using the Fisher criterion and the POE + ACC method. This approach minimized both the probability of misclassification and the average correlation coefficient between the selected parameters, ensuring that the final set of features was uncorrelated and effective for classification.\n\nThe feature selection process was performed using the training set only, ensuring that the evaluation and validation phases were conducted on independent data. This method provided a target feature vector characterized by limited variability within the analyzed classes, containing uncorrelated features, and minimizing classification error.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The study involved a comprehensive analysis of texture features from echocardiographic images to assess myocardial viability. Initially, a large set of 283 texture parameters was considered. To mitigate the risk of overfitting, given the potentially large number of parameters relative to the training data, a two-step feature selection procedure was employed.\n\nIn the first step, features with the lowest variability were selected by calculating the normalized standard deviation for each texture feature across all image regions of interest (ROIs). This ensured that only the most stable and reliable features were retained, reducing the dimensionality of the data and focusing on the most informative parameters.\n\nIn the second step, further feature reduction was achieved using the Fisher criterion and algorithms designed to minimize misclassification (POE) with an average correlation coefficient (ACC). This method ensured that the selected features were not only informative but also uncorrelated, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting and enhancing the generalization capability of the models.\n\nThe final set of features, ranging from 10 to 13, was used to train various classifiers, including multilayer perceptron (MLP), nonlinear discriminant analysis (NDA), and support vector machines (SVM) with polynomial and radial basis function kernels. The use of 5-fold cross-validation further helped in assessing the classifiers' performance and ensuring that the models were not overfitting to the training data.\n\nAdditionally, decision trees were used as \"weak\" classifiers in the AdaBoost algorithm to predict myocardial viability parameters. This ensemble method helped in improving the overall predictive performance by combining the strengths of multiple weak classifiers.\n\nThe results were correlated with information from cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) to determine the optimal analysis method. The final classifiers' metrics were calculated as the average value of the five obtained results from the cross-validation, ensuring robustness and reliability in the findings.\n\nIn summary, the study carefully managed the risk of overfitting by employing rigorous feature selection techniques and cross-validation methods. The focus on stable and uncorrelated features, along with the use of ensemble methods, ensured that the models were well-generalized and not prone to underfitting or overfitting.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our models. One of the key methods used was feature selection, which involved a two-stage process. Initially, we selected features with the lowest variability by calculating the normalized standard deviation. This step helped in reducing the dimensionality of the data and focusing on the most relevant features. Subsequently, we further refined the feature set using the Fisher criterion and the POE + ACC method. This approach aimed to minimize both the probability of misclassification and the average correlation coefficient between the selected parameters, thereby ensuring that the chosen features were uncorrelated and contributed significantly to the classification task.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized cross-validation, specifically 5-fold cross-validation, to assess the performance of our classifiers. This technique involved dividing the data into five subsets, training the model on four subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This process was repeated five times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. The final results were averaged across these five iterations, providing a more reliable estimate of the model's performance and helping to prevent overfitting.\n\nMoreover, we implemented neural networks, including Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Nonlinear Discriminant Analysis (NDA), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers with polynomial and radial basis function kernels. These models were designed to handle complex patterns in the data and were trained using a combination of contrast-enhanced and monochrome echocardiographic images. The use of different types of neural networks and kernels further helped in mitigating overfitting by providing diverse perspectives on the data.\n\nIn summary, our approach to preventing overfitting involved a combination of feature selection, cross-validation, and the use of multiple neural network architectures. These techniques collectively ensured that our models were robust, generalizable, and capable of accurately predicting myocardial viability and recovery of myocardial function.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters used in our study are detailed within the publication. Specifically, the neural network configurations, including the number of input features, hidden layers, and neurons, are explicitly mentioned. For instance, the input layer consisted of 10 to 13 features, the hidden layer contained four neurons, and the output layer had 2 to 3 neurons depending on the number of analyzed classes. The types of classifiers implemented, such as MLP, NDA, and SVM with polynomial and radial basis function kernels, are also described.\n\nThe optimization schedule and model files are not explicitly provided in the publication. However, the software tools used for texture feature evaluation and classification, such as MaZda 5.2 and Weka 3.8, are mentioned. These tools are widely available and can be accessed for further details on their configurations and optimization parameters.\n\nRegarding the availability and licensing of the configurations and parameters, the publication does not provide direct links or specific licenses for the hyper-parameter settings or model files.

The software tools used are open-source and can be accessed for further details and replication of the configurations.",
  "model/interpretability": "The models employed in this study, including Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM) with radial basis function and polynomial kernels, and AdaBoost, are generally considered black-box models. These models, particularly neural networks like MLP, are known for their complexity and lack of interpretability. They operate by learning intricate patterns from the data, making it challenging to trace back the decision-making process to specific input features.\n\nThe SVM models, while providing a decision boundary, do not offer straightforward interpretability, especially when using non-linear kernels like the radial basis function or polynomial kernels. These kernels transform the data into higher-dimensional spaces, making the decision boundary complex and difficult to interpret.\n\nAdaBoost, an ensemble learning method, combines multiple weak classifiers to form a strong classifier. While it can provide some insight into the importance of features through the weights assigned to each classifier, the overall model remains a black box due to the aggregation of many weak learners.\n\nIn summary, the models used in this research are not transparent. They are designed to maximize predictive accuracy rather than interpretability, which is a common trade-off in machine learning. The focus was on achieving high performance in predicting myocardial viability and function recovery, leveraging the strengths of these advanced algorithms.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in this study is primarily used for classification tasks. It involves the use of various algorithms, including Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Nonlinear Discriminant Analysis (NDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM) with different kernels, and AdaBoost, to classify echocardiographic images and predict myocardial viability and function recovery.\n\nThe output layer of the neural network consists of 2 to 3 neurons, corresponding to the number of analyzed classes. This setup indicates that the model is designed to categorize input data into distinct classes rather than predicting continuous values, which is characteristic of a classification model.\n\nThe results presented in the tables show the performance metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for different classification methods. These metrics are typically used to evaluate the performance of classification models.\n\nIn summary, the model is a classification model used to differentiate between various levels of myocardial viability and to predict the recovery of myocardial function based on echocardiographic images.",

A key aspect of the evaluation was the use of 5-fold cross-validation, which is a standard technique in machine learning to assess the performance of classifiers. This process involved dividing the dataset into five subsets, training the model on four of these subsets, and testing it on the remaining one. This procedure was repeated five times, with each subset serving as the test set once.

The evaluation also included statistical analysis, with the Shapiro-Wilk test used to check for normal distribution and cross-tables used for the analysis of viability and evaluation of positive and negative predictive values. All analyses were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics 20 software.\n\nThe evaluation confirmed the best detection of necrotic tissue in specific groups and demonstrated that myocardial contrast enhancement allows superior classification of necrotic tissue compared to native grayscale images. The use of artificial intelligence combined with texture analysis showed potential for creating advanced prognostic tools in cardiovascular disease, even using standard or contrast-enhanced echocardiographic imaging.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed several performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of our classifiers in assessing myocardial viability and predicting the recovery of myocardial function. The primary metrics reported include sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and the best prediction percentage.\n\nSensitivity measures the ability of the classifier to correctly identify true positive cases, while specificity assesses the ability to correctly identify true negative cases. PPV indicates the probability that a positive test result is a true positive, and NPV indicates the probability that a negative test result is a true negative. The best prediction percentage provides an overall measure of the classifier's accuracy in predicting the correct outcomes.\n\nThese metrics were calculated for various classification methods, including Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM) with both polynomial and radial basis function kernels, and AdaBoost. The results were obtained using 5-fold cross-validation, ensuring that the metrics are robust and not dependent on a particular split of the data.\n\nThe reported metrics are representative of those commonly used in the literature for evaluating classification models in medical imaging. Sensitivity and specificity are crucial for understanding the diagnostic performance of the classifiers, while PPV and NPV provide insights into the clinical utility of the test results. The best prediction percentage offers a comprehensive view of the classifier's overall accuracy.\n\nAdditionally, we compared the performance of different types of images, including contrast-enhanced and monochrome images, to determine the most effective approach for myocardial viability assessment. The results indicate that contrast-enhanced images, particularly the red component, yield higher accuracy in classifying myocardial viability and predicting functional recovery.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics reported in our study are comprehensive and align with standard practices in the field. They provide a clear and representative evaluation of the classifiers' effectiveness in assessing myocardial viability and predicting functional recovery.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we conducted a thorough comparison of various methods to evaluate myocardial viability using echocardiographic images. We analyzed both monochrome and color images, with and without contrast enhancement, to determine the most effective approach.\n\nWe employed several classifiers, including artificial neural networks (ANN), nonlinear discriminant analysis (NDA), and support vector machines (SVM) with different kernels. The results were compared to determine which method provided the highest accuracy in detecting myocardial viability. For instance, the red component of contrast-enhanced images showed the highest perception values in differentiating necrosis versus no necrosis and in classifying different levels of transmurality.\n\nAdditionally, we compared the performance of these classifiers using different types of images. The neural network approach demonstrated superior performance in classifying the absence of necrosis and different levels of transmurality based on resting contrast imaging. The results indicated that contrast-enhanced images, particularly the red component, yielded better classification accuracy compared to native grayscale images.\n\nWe also evaluated the effectiveness of different classification techniques in predicting myocardial function recovery. The analysis showed that contrast-enhanced images, especially those using the red component, provided the best results for proper classification. This was evident in both transthoracic echocardiographic examinations and dobutamine stress echocardiography.\n\nIn summary, our study involved a comprehensive comparison of various methods and image types to assess myocardial viability. The use of contrast-enhanced images, particularly the red component, along with advanced classifiers like ANN, proved to be the most effective in achieving accurate and reliable results.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our method's performance included the use of 5-fold cross-validation to assess the quality of the classifiers. This technique helps to ensure that the results are robust and not dependent on a particular split of the data. The final results of the classifiers' metrics were calculated as the average value of the five obtained results from the cross-validation process. This approach provides a more reliable estimate of the model's performance.\n\nStatistical significance was checked using the Shapiro-Wilk test to verify the normal distribution of the data. The cross-table was used for the analysis of viability, evaluation of positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. These statistical methods help to ensure that the differences observed between the methods are not due to random chance.\n\nThe results obtained for the different types of classifiers for both monochrome and color images after the use of the contrast agent showed high values of perception, particularly for the red component in differentiating necrosis versus no necrosis. These results represent the mean percentage of positive validation obtained after the 5-fold cross-validation, indicating a high level of confidence in the performance metrics.\n\nThe neural network approach allowed correct classification regarding the absence of necrosis in a significant percentage of segments and images, based on resting contrast imaging. The results were obtained for the red component of the color scale as mean values of 5-fold network cross-validation, further supporting the reliability of the findings.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics include confidence intervals derived from the cross-validation process, and the results are statistically significant.
