  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study consists of 46 gene names, which were obtained from the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database Genbank. Among these genes, 30 were recurrently deleted genes, and 16 were recurrently amplified genes in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). The coding sequences of these genes were retrieved and used for analysis.\n\nThe dataset was prepared by encoding the DNA sequences of Homo sapiens, which are composed of four bases: A, T, G, and C. These bases were represented in numerical vector form for training the neural network. The numerical values assigned for encoding were 0 for A, 0.5 for T, 1 for G, and 1.5 for C. This encoding methodology was crucial for improving the network's performance and ensuring that the data was presented in a suitable format for the neural network to process.\n\nThe entire dataset of 30 genes was compiled into a matrix of 10000 by 30. This matrix was used for training, validation, and testing the neural network models. The data was divided into three sets: 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. Various combinations of these sets were used to ensure robust training and validation of the neural network.\n\nThe dataset was prepared using a C-program that converted the gene nucleotide sequences into an Excel file with a .xls extension. This program directed successive nucleotide codes into successive rows with a common column, facilitating the organization and processing of the data.\n\nThe sequences were arranged and standardized to ensure uniformity. Sequences with more than 10000 nucleotides were trimmed to 10000 nucleotides, while sequences with fewer than 10000 nucleotides were extended by repeating the first 1-9 nucleotides until the sequence reached 10000 nucleotides. This standardization was essential for maintaining consistency in the dataset.\n\nThe dataset was then used to train and validate neural network models, with the aim of accurately classifying candidate genes causing HCC and deducing relationships between them. The performance of the neural network was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R2 values, which provided insights into the network's accuracy and generalization capabilities.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset used in this study consists of 46 gene names, with their coding sequences obtained from the NCBI database Genbank. These genes were divided into two main categories: 30 recurrently deleted genes and 16 recurrently amplified genes in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC).\n\nFor the neural network training, the dataset was split into three main parts: training, validation, and testing. Initially, 32 data points were used for training, 7 for validation, and 7 for testing. However, the splits were adjusted to use 70% of the total genes for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. This distribution translates to 20 genes for training, 5 for validation, and 5 for testing.\n\nThe training, testing, and validation processes were performed with all possible combinations of the dataset. Different numbers of hidden layers and mixtures were used to generate network architectures that provided the least error. The network was trained with various types of hidden nodes, and the validation and testing sets were changed accordingly. After rigorous training, the optimal performance was achieved with 10 hidden nodes, using 15% of the data for both the testing and validation sets.\n\nThe performance measures, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R2 values, were calculated for each split. The R2 value for the training set was 0.99136, for the testing set it was 0.80515, and for the validation set it was 0.76678. The overall R2 value for the entire dataset was 0.93417. These values indicate a strong correlation between the outputs and targets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the neural network in classifying candidate genes causing HCC.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset used in this study consisted of 46 gene names, with their coding sequences obtained from the NCBI database Genbank. These genes were categorized into two groups: 30 recurrently deleted genes and 16 recurrently amplified genes in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). The dataset was prepared by encoding the DNA sequences of Homo sapiens, which are composed of the bases A, T, G, and C. These bases were represented numerically as 0, 0.5, 1, and 1.5, respectively. This encoding allowed for the conversion of gene nucleotide sequences into a matrix format suitable for neural network training.\n\nThe dataset was split into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. Specifically, 70% of the data was used for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. This split was performed to ensure that the training and test sets were independent. The independence of these sets was enforced by using different subsets of the data for each purpose, preventing any overlap that could bias the results. The training set was used to adjust the network parameters, the validation set was used to tune the network and prevent overfitting, and the testing set provided an unbiased evaluation of the final model's performance.\n\nThe distribution of the dataset in this study is comparable to previously published machine learning datasets in the context of gene expression analysis. The use of a structured approach to data encoding and splitting ensures that the results are reliable and generalizable. The rigorous training process, which involved varying the number of hidden layers and nodes, further ensured that the model could handle the complexity of the data and provide accurate predictions. The performance measures, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R2 values, were used to evaluate the model's effectiveness, with the R2 value indicating the strength of the relationship between the outputs and targets. An R2 value close to 1 signifies a strong linear relationship, while a value close to 0 indicates a random relationship. The MSE, defined as the average squared difference between targets and outputs, was used to assess the model's accuracy. The training process was automated to stop when the generalization performance ceased to improve, ensuring that the model did not overfit the training data.",
  "dataset/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in this study is the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), specifically the Multilayer Feedforward Artificial Neural Network (MLFANN). This type of neural network is well-established and widely used in various fields for its ability to model complex relationships.\n\nThe algorithm employed is not new; it is a well-known technique in the field of machine learning. The Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm was used for training the neural network. The LM algorithm is a standard method for solving nonlinear least squares problems and is particularly effective for training moderate-sized feedforward neural networks. It combines the advantages of the gradient descent method and the Gauss-Newton method, making it robust and efficient for many applications.\n\nThe choice to use this established algorithm in a genomics context, rather than a machine-learning journal, is driven by the specific application and the goals of the study. The focus here is on applying neural networks to classify candidate genes causing Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) and to deduce relationships between them. The study aims to contribute to the field of genomics and cancer research by demonstrating the effectiveness of neural networks in handling large datasets and providing accurate predictions for clinical diagnosis. The publication in a genomics journal aligns with the study's objectives of advancing the understanding and diagnosis of liver cancer through innovative computational methods.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model described in this publication does not function as a meta-predictor. It is an artificial neural network (ANN) designed specifically for the classification of candidate genes causing Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). The ANN is trained using experimental data related to molecular markers for liver cancer. The training process involves using a subset of the data for training, another for validation, and a third for testing. The network's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the R2 value, which indicate the correlation between the outputs and targets.\n\nThe ANN does not incorporate data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it relies solely on the experimental data provided. The training, validation, and testing sets are carefully divided to ensure that the model can generalize well to new data. The network architecture includes multiple hidden layers, with 10 hidden nodes identified as providing optimal results. The training process involves adjusting the network based on its error, with the goal of minimizing the MSE and maximizing the R2 value.\n\nThe independence of the training data is maintained through the use of different subsets for training, validation, and testing. This ensures that the model's performance is evaluated on data that it has not seen during training, providing a more accurate measure of its generalization capabilities. The network's performance is monitored through various figures that show the regression, training, and validation processes, as well as the actual and predicted outputs.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, data encoding played a crucial role in enhancing the performance of the neural network. DNA sequences of Homo sapiens, which consist of the four bases adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C), were converted into numerical vectors suitable for neural network training. Specifically, the bases were encoded as follows: A as 0, T as 0.5, G as 1, and C as 1.5. This numerical representation allowed the neural network to process the genetic data effectively.\n\nThe gene sequences were obtained from the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database Genbank. A total of 46 gene names were identified, with 30 being recurrently deleted genes and 16 being recurrently amplified genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). These sequences were then pre-processed to ensure uniformity. Sequences exceeding 10,000 nucleotides were trimmed to this length, while shorter sequences were padded by repeating their initial nucleotides until they reached 10,000 nucleotides. This standardization was essential for creating a consistent input format for the neural network.\n\nA C-program was developed to convert the gene nucleotide sequences into an Excel file with a .xls extension. This program organized the successive nucleotide codes into successive rows within a single column, resulting in a matrix of 10,000 rows by 30 columns for the 30 genes analyzed. This structured format facilitated the efficient training and processing of the data by the neural network.\n\nTwo files were created: one for input data (ipp) and another for output data (opp). These files were used in the subsequent training and validation processes. The input data file contained the encoded nucleotide sequences, while the output data file included the corresponding target values necessary for training the neural network.\n\nThe neural network methodology employed in this study utilized a multi-layered feed-forward artificial neural network (MLFANN) trained with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. This approach was chosen for its efficiency in handling nonlinear least squares problems, which are common in genetic data analysis. The network's architecture included multiple hidden layers, with the optimal number of hidden nodes determined through rigorous training and validation processes. The performance of the network was evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and the R2 value, which indicated the correlation between the network's outputs and the target values.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized a total of 46 experimental data points to develop our Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models. These data points were divided into three sets: 32 for training, 7 for validation, and 7 for testing. The division of data was done in a way that 70% of the total genes were used for training, while 15% were used for validation and another 15% for testing. This division was performed with all possible combinations to ensure robustness in our model.\n\nThe selection of the number of hidden nodes was a critical parameter in our model. We experimented with different numbers of hidden layers and various mixtures to generate network architectures that provided the least error. After rigorous training and validation, we found that 10 hidden nodes yielded the optimal performance. This configuration was determined through extensive testing and validation processes, ensuring that the model's predictions were as accurate as possible.\n\nThe training process involved using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, which is effective for solving nonlinear least squares problems. This algorithm combines the gradient descent method and the Gauss-Newton technique, making it highly efficient for our purposes. The number of epochs and the structure of the hidden layers were adjusted to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) and maximize the R2 value, indicating a strong correlation between the outputs and targets.\n\nIn summary, the model was optimized by carefully selecting the number of hidden nodes and using an effective training algorithm. The division of data into training, validation, and testing sets ensured that the model was thoroughly tested and validated, leading to reliable and accurate predictions.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized 46 experimental data points to develop our Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models. These data points served as the input features for our neural network. The process involved using 32 of these data points for training the network, 7 for validation, and 7 for testing. The division of the data was done in such a way that all possible combinations were considered to ensure robust training, validation, and testing phases.\n\nFeature selection was implicitly performed by focusing on a stringent quality filter. This filter included only the genetic factors for which there were good capacities across all samples. This approach ensured that the selected features were reliable and representative, although it may have excluded some genes that were highly expressed in certain cancers but not in others. The aim was to optimize the classification of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) by using a set of features that provided the best performance in terms of prediction accuracy.\n\nThe feature selection process was conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the validation and testing sets remained independent. This independence is crucial for evaluating the generalization capability of the model. By training the network with a diverse set of features and validating it with unseen data, we could assess the model's performance objectively. The use of 10 hidden nodes in the network architecture further enhanced the model's ability to capture complex relationships within the data, leading to optimal results.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed a Multilayer Feedforward Artificial Neural Network (MLFANN) to tackle the problem of identifying molecular markers for liver cancer. The network architecture included multiple hidden layers, with the optimal configuration found to be 10 hidden nodes. This setup was chosen after extensive training and validation processes, ensuring that the model could generalize well to unseen data.\n\nThe number of parameters in our neural network was indeed larger than the number of training points. To mitigate the risk of overfitting, we implemented several strategies. Firstly, we used a validation set to monitor the network's performance during training. The training process was stopped when the generalization performance ceased to improve, as indicated by an increase in the mean squared error of the validation samples. This early stopping criterion helped to prevent the model from becoming too complex and overfitting the training data.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for training, which is known for its efficiency in handling nonlinear least squares problems. This algorithm combines the advantages of gradient descent and the Gauss-Newton method, providing a robust approach to parameter estimation. The Levenberg-Marquardt method adjusts the learning rate dynamically, which helps in avoiding local minima and ensures a more stable convergence.\n\nTo address the potential issue of underfitting, we ensured that the network had sufficient complexity by varying the number of hidden nodes and layers. The optimal architecture with 10 hidden nodes was selected based on its performance on the validation set. Furthermore, we performed rigorous training with different initial conditions and data divisions, ensuring that the model could capture the underlying patterns in the data without being too simplistic.\n\nThe performance of the network was evaluated using metrics such as the mean squared error (MSE) and the R2 value. The R2 value, in particular, provided a measure of the correlation between the outputs and targets, with values closer to 1 indicating a stronger linear relationship. The network's ability to generalize was further validated through testing on independent datasets, demonstrating its robustness and reliability.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the generalization of our neural network models. One of the key methods used was the division of our dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. Specifically, we used 70% of the data for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. This division helped in monitoring the network's performance on unseen data, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized the Mean Squared Error (MSE) as a performance metric, which is sensitive to large errors and helps in identifying when the model starts to overfit. The training process was designed to stop automatically when the generalization performance ceased to improve, as indicated by an increase in the MSE of the validation samples. This early stopping criterion is an effective regularization technique that prevents the model from becoming too complex and overfitting the training data.\n\nWe also experimented with different numbers of hidden nodes and epochs to find the optimal network architecture. Through rigorous training and validation, we determined that 10 hidden nodes with 23 epochs provided the best performance. This careful tuning of the network parameters helped in achieving a balance between model complexity and generalization ability.\n\nFurthermore, we employed the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for training our neural networks. This algorithm combines the advantages of gradient descent and the Gauss-Newton method, making it effective in handling nonlinear least squares problems. The Levenberg-Marquardt method adapts its behavior based on the proximity of the parameters to their optimal values, which aids in preventing overfitting by ensuring that the model does not become too sensitive to the training data.\n\nIn summary, our approach to preventing overfitting involved data division, early stopping based on validation performance, careful tuning of network parameters, and the use of an adaptive training algorithm. These techniques collectively contributed to the robustness and generalization of our neural network models.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization schedule used in our study are reported within the publication. Specifically, we utilized 10 hidden nodes in our neural networks, which provided optimal results. The training process involved 23 epochs, and we employed the scaled conjugate gradient method for training. The performance was evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) and the R2 value, which indicates the relationship between outputs and targets. The R2 value closer to 1 signifies a stronger linear relationship and higher accuracy.\n\nThe model files and optimization parameters are not explicitly provided in the publication. However, the methodology and results are detailed sufficiently to replicate the experiments. The figures included in the publication, such as Fig. (2) for neural network architecture and Fig. (3) for regression and training validation, offer visual representations of the configurations and performance metrics.\n\nRegarding the availability and licensing of the reported configurations and schedules, they are presented within the academic publication. The publication itself is subject to the standard academic publishing licenses, which typically allow for educational and research use with proper citation. For specific details on licensing, one would need to refer to the journal's policies or contact the publishers directly.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which is generally considered a black-box model. This means that while the ANN can provide accurate predictions, the internal workings and the specific reasoning behind these predictions are not easily interpretable. The ANN operates by learning complex patterns and relationships within the data through multiple layers of interconnected nodes, making it challenging to trace the exact decision-making process.\n\nHowever, the transparency of the model can be partially achieved through the analysis of its performance metrics. For instance, the R2 value indicates the strength of the relationship between the outputs and targets, with values closer to 1 signifying a stronger linear relationship. Additionally, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) provides insight into the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values, helping to assess the model's accuracy.\n\nThe use of regression plots and performance graphs, such as those showing the relationship between MSE and epochs, offers visual representations of the model's training and validation processes. These visual aids can help in understanding how well the model generalizes to new data and identify points where the model's performance improves or plateaus.\n\nFurthermore, the comparison between the actual and predicted outputs of the neural network training provides a clear example of the model's performance. While the model shows high accuracy in most cases, there are instances where the predictions deviate from the actual values. This deviation can be attributed to the complexity of the data and the inherent limitations of the model.\n\nIn summary, while the ANN model used in this study is primarily a black-box model, various performance metrics and visual aids can be utilized to gain some level of interpretability. These tools help in understanding the model's behavior and assessing its reliability in predicting outcomes related to Hepatocellular Carcinoma.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a classification model. It utilizes artificial neural networks (ANNs) to identify and classify candidate genes associated with Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). The primary goal is to accurately classify these genes and establish relationships between them, which supports and predicts clinical diagnoses of the disease.\n\nThe neural network architecture consists of two parallel networks, network 1 and network 2, each with varying numbers of hidden nodes. Through rigorous training and validation processes, it was determined that 10 hidden nodes provided optimal performance. The model was trained using 46 experimental data points, with 32 used for training, 7 for validation, and 7 for testing. This distribution was adjusted to ensure comprehensive coverage and to minimize errors.\n\nPerformance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the R2 value were used to evaluate the model's accuracy. The R2 value, in particular, indicates the strength of the relationship between the outputs and targets, with values closer to 1 signifying a stronger correlation. The model's training involved multiple iterations and epochs, with the best results achieved after 23 epochs using 10 hidden layers.\n\nThe actual and predicted outputs of the neural network training were compared, showing that the model's predictions closely matched the experimental results. This alignment demonstrates the model's effectiveness in classifying genes related to liver cancer. The figures provided in the study illustrate the training state, validation performance, and the relationship between outputs and targets, further validating the model's accuracy and reliability.\n\nIn summary, the model is a classification tool designed to identify and classify genes associated with HCC, utilizing ANNs to achieve high accuracy and reliability in its predictions.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time for the neural network training was quite efficient. Specifically, for an epoch with 9 iterations, the time taken was approximately 0.06 seconds. This demonstrates the model's capability to handle large datasets with a good convergence rate, making it suitable for the analysis of complex biological data, such as those related to liver cancer. The training process was optimized to ensure that the network could be trained effectively within a reasonable time frame, which is crucial for practical applications in clinical diagnostics.",

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the method involved using artificial neural networks (ANNs) to classify candidate genes causing Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) and to establish a relationship between them. The neural network was trained using 46 experimental data points, with 32 used for training, 7 for validation, and 7 for testing. The performance measures, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R2 values, were used to assess the network's effectiveness.\n\nThe training process involved varying the number of hidden layers and nodes to find the architecture that provided the least error.

The network's generalization was measured using testing nodes, and training stopped when generalization ceased to improve. Validation nodes provided an independent measure of network performance during and after training.\n\nThe method was compared with other classification tools, such as Support Vector Machines, and was found to be effective in categorizing gene-expression profiles without requiring genes to be exclusively related to a single cancer type. This allows for organization based on complex gene-expression patterns.\n\nOverall, the evaluation demonstrated that the ANN methodology is efficient for HCC classification and gene signature identification, providing a reliable tool for clinical diagnosis and treatment decision-making.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed several performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of our neural network models. The primary metrics reported are the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the R-squared (R2) value. MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted outputs and the actual targets, providing a clear indication of the model's accuracy. A lower MSE signifies better performance. The R2 value, on the other hand, quantifies the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. An R2 value closer to 1 indicates a stronger linear relationship between the outputs and targets, reflecting higher model accuracy.\n\nThese metrics were calculated for different stages of the model's development, including training, validation, and testing phases. For instance, the R2 value obtained after training was 0.99136, while the R2 value after validation was 0.76678. The overall R2 value, considering all datasets, was 0.93417. These values demonstrate that our experimental results closely align with the neural network's predicted outcomes.\n\nThe use of MSE and R2 values is standard in the literature for evaluating the performance of neural network models. These metrics are widely accepted and provide a comprehensive assessment of model accuracy and generalization capabilities. Additionally, we monitored the training state and error reduction over iterations, which further validated the model's performance. The figures provided in the study, such as the regression plots and performance graphs, visually represent these metrics, making it easier to interpret the model's effectiveness.\n\nIn summary, the reported performance metrics\u2014MSE and R2 values\u2014are representative of current practices in the field. They offer a robust evaluation of our neural network models, ensuring that the results are reliable and comparable to other studies in the literature.",

  "evaluation/confidence": "Evaluation Confidence\n\nThe evaluation of our neural network methodology for identifying hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was conducted using several performance metrics, including the R2 value and Mean Squared Error (MSE). These metrics were calculated for training, validation, and testing datasets to assess the model's performance comprehensively.\n\nThe R2 value, which indicates the relationship between the outputs and targets, was found to be 0.99136 for the training set, 0.76678 for the validation set, and 0.93417 for the overall data.
