  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset utilized in this study comprises several sources to provide a comprehensive analysis of melanoma. The GSE65904 cohort was used, which includes gene expression and survival data for melanoma. Additionally, pan-cancer transcriptome data were obtained from the Xena visual integration and exploration tool. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of the B16F0 and B16F10 cell lines were sourced from the GSE156444 dataset. RNA-seq data for our B16F0 and B16F10 cell lines are provided in the supplemental material. Four melanoma bulk-seq cohorts (GSE35640, GSE78220, GSE91061, and GSE115821) and one melanoma scRNA-seq cohort (GSE120575) with immunotherapy response data were employed to evaluate the efficiency of the MET score in predicting immunotherapy responses. The GSE189889 cohort contained scRNA-seq data of five non-metastatic melanoma (NMM) and four metastatic melanoma (MM) samples. The TCGA-SKCM cohort was also used for immune microenvironment quantification. These datasets collectively provide a robust foundation for analyzing gene expression patterns, survival data, and immunotherapy responses in melanoma.",
  "dataset/splits": "In our study, we utilized several datasets to analyze gene expression and survival data for melanoma. The primary dataset used was the GSE65904 cohort, which includes gene expression and survival data for melanoma patients. Additionally, pan-cancer transcriptome data were obtained from the Xena visual integration and exploration tool.\n\nFor single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, we used the GSE156444 dataset, which includes data from the B16F0 and B16F10 cell lines.

After quality control and data preprocessing, all cells from the nine samples were grouped into 16 clusters.\n\nThe GSE189889 cohort was used to explore the key cellular components involved in the metastasis of melanoma. The data from this cohort were used to delineate and compare cell-cell communication in NMM and MM, providing insights into the evolutionary trajectory from NMM to MM at the single-cell level.\n\nIn summary, our study involved multiple datasets, including bulk-seq and scRNA-seq data, to comprehensively analyze the gene expression patterns and survival data in melanoma.

  "optimization/algorithm": "The study utilized diverse machine-learning algorithms to construct the metastasis score (MET score) for predicting the metastatic potential of melanoma. The specific algorithms employed included univariate Cox regression analysis with a bootstrap algorithm, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis, and multivariate Cox regression analysis with a bootstrap algorithm. These methods are well-established in the field of machine learning and statistics, particularly for survival analysis and feature selection in high-dimensional data.\n\nThe algorithms used are not new but are widely recognized and validated in the scientific community. They were chosen for their robustness and ability to handle complex biological data. The focus of the study was on applying these algorithms to melanoma data rather than developing new machine-learning techniques. Therefore, publishing in a machine-learning journal was not the primary objective. The algorithms were selected for their effectiveness in identifying potential metastatic-related genes that are highly correlated with overall survival, which is crucial for constructing a reliable MET score.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model developed in this study is indeed a meta-predictor, leveraging data from various machine-learning algorithms to construct the metastasis score (MET score). The process involves multiple steps and algorithms to ensure robustness and reliability.\n\nThe construction of the MET score begins with differential expression analysis using bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data. This analysis identifies potential metastatic-related genes. Subsequently, univariate Cox regression analysis with a bootstrap algorithm, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis, and multivariate Cox regression analysis with a bootstrap algorithm are performed. These methods work together to screen and identify genes that are highly correlated with overall survival (OS).\n\nThe bootstrap coefficient for each included potential metastatic-related gene is defined using a specific formula, which incorporates the coefficient and its bootstrap standard deviation. This coefficient is then used to calculate the MET score for each patient, based on the expression levels of the identified genes.\n\nThe training data for these algorithms is derived from multiple sources, including the GSE46517 and GSE189889 datasets for bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data, respectively, and the TCGA-SKCM cohort for gene expression, clinical features, and survival data. External validation is performed using the GSE65904 cohort, ensuring that the training data is independent and the findings are generalizable.\n\nIn summary, the MET score is constructed using a comprehensive approach that integrates data from diverse machine-learning algorithms and validates the results through independent datasets. This meta-predictor approach enhances the reliability and robustness of the MET score in predicting the metastatic potential and prognosis of melanoma.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the machine-learning algorithms employed in our study, data encoding and preprocessing were crucial steps to ensure the accuracy and reliability of our results. Initially, we performed quality control on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, retaining only cells with more than 200 detected genes and less than 20% mitochondrial genes. This step was essential to filter out low-quality cells that could introduce noise into our analyses.\n\nNext, we utilized the Seurat package for data preprocessing. The \"NormalizeData\" function was applied to normalize the data, which helps to account for differences in sequencing depth across cells. Following normalization, the \"FindVariableFeatures\" function identified the most variable genes, which are typically the most informative for downstream analyses. The \"ScaleData\" function was then used to scale the data, ensuring that each gene contributed equally to the principal component analysis (PCA).\n\nTo address batch effects, which can arise from differences in sample preparation or sequencing runs, we employed the Harmony package. This tool effectively integrates data from multiple batches, allowing for more accurate clustering and visualization.\n\nFor visualization, we performed graph-based clustering and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). These techniques helped us to identify and visualize distinct cell clusters within our datasets. The \"FindAllMarkers\" function was used to identify marker genes for each cluster, which were then manually annotated using classical marker genes.\n\nIn addition to scRNA-seq data, we also utilized bulk RNA sequencing (bulk-seq) data. Differential expression analysis between non-metastatic melanoma (NMM) and metastatic melanoma (MM) was performed using the DESeq2 package. The results were visualized using ggplot2 and ComplexHeatmap packages. Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were conducted using the clusterProfiler package to reveal specific pathways enriched in NMM and MM.\n\nFor the construction of the metastasis score (MET score), we employed univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses with a bootstrap algorithm. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was also used to screen potential metastatic-related genes highly correlated with overall survival (OS). The bootstrap coefficient of the included potential metastatic-related genes was defined using a specific formula, and the MET score was calculated based on the expression levels of these genes.\n\nOverall, our data encoding and preprocessing steps were designed to ensure the robustness and reliability of our machine-learning analyses, enabling us to derive meaningful insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying melanoma metastasis.",
  "optimization/parameters": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, the input features for the MET score construction were derived from gene expression data. Specifically, we utilized gene expression profiles from various melanoma cohorts, including bulk-seq and scRNA-seq data. The feature selection process involved several steps to identify potential metastatic-related genes highly correlated with overall survival (OS).\n\nFirst, univariate Cox regression analysis with a bootstrap algorithm was performed to screen for genes associated with OS. This was followed by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis to further refine the selection of genes. Finally, multivariate Cox regression analysis with a bootstrap algorithm was conducted to determine the final set of genes included in the MET score.\n\nThe bootstrap coefficient for each included gene was calculated using the formula: bootstrap coefficient = coefficient / bootstrap standard deviation. This coefficient was then used to weight the expression levels of the selected genes in the MET score formula: MET score = \u03a3 (bootstrap coefficient * expression level of included gene).\n\nTo ensure the robustness of our feature selection process, all analyses were performed using the training set only, avoiding any potential bias from the test set. This rigorous approach allowed us to identify a set of genes that are highly predictive of metastasis and overall survival in melanoma patients.",
  "optimization/fitting": "Not applicable",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several regularization methods to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our models. Specifically, we utilized the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis. This technique is particularly effective in high-dimensional data settings, as it performs both variable selection and regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the model. By incorporating LASSO, we were able to identify the most relevant features associated with melanoma metastasis, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting. Additionally, we employed bootstrap algorithms in both univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses to further validate the stability and reliability of our findings. These methods collectively contributed to the construction of a robust metastasis score (MET score) that accurately predicts the metastatic potential of melanoma.",
  "optimization/config": "Not applicable.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model presented in this study is not a black-box model. It is designed to be interpretable and transparent, providing clear insights into the mechanisms underlying melanoma metastasis.\n\nThe model incorporates a metastasis score (MET score) that is constructed using a combination of machine-learning algorithms, including univariate Cox regression analysis with a bootstrap algorithm, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis, and multivariate Cox regression analysis with a bootstrap algorithm. These methods are used to identify potential metastatic-related genes that are highly correlated with overall survival (OS). The bootstrap coefficient of each included gene is defined, allowing for a clear understanding of the contribution of each gene to the MET score.\n\nThe MET score is calculated using a formula that incorporates the bootstrap coefficients and expression levels of the identified genes. This formula provides a quantitative measure of the metastatic potential of melanoma, which can be used to stratify patients into low or high MET score groups. The survival analysis demonstrates that patients with high MET scores have a worse OS compared to those with low MET scores, indicating the prognostic value of the MET score.\n\nFurthermore, the model includes an immune microenvironment analysis, which uses CIBERSORT to quantify the immune microenvironment in the TCGA-SKCM and GSE65904 cohorts. This analysis provides insights into the anticancer immune status of the two groups based on the tumor immune cycle in seven stages. The model also includes a cell culture and transfection subsection, which describes the experimental procedures used to validate the findings of the study.\n\nIn summary, the model is transparent and interpretable, providing clear insights into the mechanisms underlying melanoma metastasis. The MET score is a quantitative measure of metastatic potential that can be used to stratify patients and guide treatment decisions. The immune microenvironment analysis and experimental validation further enhance the interpretability of the model.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is primarily a classification model, as it stratifies patients into low or high metastasis score groups based on the median metastasis score (MET score). This classification is used to predict the metastatic potential and prognosis of melanoma patients. The model employs various machine-learning algorithms, including univariate Cox regression analysis with a bootstrap algorithm, LASSO regression analysis, and multivariate Cox regression analysis with a bootstrap algorithm, to identify prognostic potential metastatic-related genes. These genes are then used to establish the MET score, which serves as a classifier for metastatic potential. Additionally, the model's performance is validated using survival analysis, demonstrating that patients with high MET scores have worse overall survival compared to those with low MET scores. The MET score is also applied to pan-cancer analysis, showing its consistent prognostic prediction effect across various types of cancer.",

  "evaluation/method": "The method was evaluated using a combination of computational analyses and experimental validations. Initially, the MET score was constructed using bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data through diverse machine-learning algorithms. This involved univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, along with LASSO regression, to identify potential metastatic-related genes highly correlated with overall survival.\n\nTo assess the efficiency of the MET score in predicting immunotherapy responses, four melanoma bulk-seq cohorts (GSE35640, GSE78220, GSE91061, and GSE115821) and one melanoma scRNA-seq cohort (GSE120575) with immunotherapy response data were utilized. These cohorts included samples from patients who had not received prior targeted therapy or immunotherapy before surgery, ensuring that the gene expression patterns were not influenced by anti-tumor drug therapy.\n\nThe accuracy of the MET score was further validated through various in vitro and in vivo assays. In vitro assays included wound healing, invasion, and migration assays using B16F0 and B16F10 cell lines. For in vivo assays, metastasis models were established by injecting B16F0-Luc or B16F10-Luc cells into the tail vein of mice, and the fluorescence intensity of lung metastases was observed using bioluminescence assays. Additionally, subcutaneous xenograft tumor models were created to measure tumor growth and weight.\n\nThe immune microenvironment was quantified using CIBERSORT in the TCGA-SKCM and GSE65904 cohorts, and the anticancer immune status was explored using Tracking of the Tumor Immunophenotype (TIP). The findings suggest that using anti-PD-1 as a postoperative adjuvant treatment can effectively inhibit melanoma metastasis in patients with a low MET score, while combination therapy is recommended for patients with a high MET score.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our study, several performance metrics were reported to assess the efficacy of the MET score in predicting immunotherapy responses and the metastatic potential of melanoma.\n\nFirstly, we utilized survival analysis, specifically the Kaplan-Meier method, to evaluate the overall survival (OS) of patients stratified by their MET scores. This allowed us to demonstrate that patients with high MET scores had worse OS compared to those with low MET scores.\n\nAdditionally, we performed univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses to identify prognostic potential metastatic-related genes and to confirm the MET score as an independent prognostic factor for melanoma. The bootstrap algorithm was employed to enhance the robustness of these regression models.\n\nTo validate the MET score, we conducted subgroup analyses under different clinicopathological conditions, ensuring that the prognostic prediction ability of the MET score was consistent across various scenarios.\n\nFurthermore, we applied the MET score to a pan-cancer analysis, revealing its consistent prognostic prediction effect in various types of cancer, such as kidney chromophobe, head and neck cancer, and lower-grade glioma.\n\nIn the context of single-cell analysis, we used the \"AddModuleScore\" function of the \"Seurat\" package to calculate the MET score at the single-cell level. This enabled us to compare the MET scores of different cell types, particularly angio-TAMs and melanoma cells, highlighting that MM cells exhibited elevated MET scores.\n\nFor experimental validation, we performed wound healing, Transwell migration, and invasion assays to compare the metastatic potential of B16F0 and B16F10 cells. Statistical charts were generated to quantify the differences observed in these assays.\n\nIn vivo assays, including bioluminescence assays and subcutaneous xenograft tumor models, were conducted to assess the metastatic behavior and survival outcomes of mice injected with B16F0-Luc and B16F10-Luc cells. The fluorescence intensity of lung metastases and the survival status of the mice were recorded and analyzed.\n\nOverall, the reported performance metrics are representative of standard practices in the literature for evaluating prognostic scores and metastatic potential in cancer research. These metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of the MET score's predictive power and its potential clinical utility.",

  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our method includes several statistical analyses to ensure the robustness and significance of our findings. We employed various statistical tests such as the student\u2019s t-test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, one-way analysis of variance, log-rank test, and Cox regression analyses. These tests were performed using R 4.1.1, and the statistical significance cut-off value was set at P < 0.05, unless otherwise specified.\n\nFor the MET score, we conducted univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses with a bootstrap algorithm to identify potential metastatic-related genes. The bootstrap coefficient was defined to quantify the contribution of each gene. The MET score was then calculated using the expression levels of these genes, weighted by their bootstrap coefficients. This approach ensures that the MET score is robust and reliable.\n\nIn our experiments, we compared the MET scores between different cell lines and conditions, such as B16F0 and B16F10 cells. The results showed significant differences in MET scores, with B16F10 cells exhibiting higher scores, indicating greater metastatic potential. These differences were statistically significant, as indicated by the P-values in our figures.\n\nAdditionally, we validated our findings in multiple cohorts, including the GSE65904 cohort and the TCGA-SKCM cohort. The MET score was confirmed as an independent prognostic factor for melanoma, and its prognostic prediction ability was consistent across different clinicopathological conditions and various types of cancer in a pan-cancer analysis.\n\nOverall, the performance metrics of our method include confidence intervals and statistical significance tests, ensuring that our claims of superiority over other methods and baselines are well-supported.
