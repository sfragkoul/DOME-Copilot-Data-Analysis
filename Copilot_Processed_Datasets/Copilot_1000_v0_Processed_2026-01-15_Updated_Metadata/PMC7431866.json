  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study is derived from the top 10 countries with the highest number of COVID-19 cases as of May 20, 2020. The specific data points include the estimates of \u03b2 and \u03b3 parameters, which are crucial for the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model. These estimates, along with the absolute value of the percent daily changes in parameter estimates, are presented in tables for specific dates, such as April 21 and 22, 2020, and May 19 and 20, 2020.\n\nThe data used in this study has been previously utilized in other research efforts, including a study by the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) that aimed to estimate the ending dates of the COVID-19 pandemic for different countries. The code authored by Batista in MATLAB, which was used in this study, has also been widely used and rated highly by the community. This code has been downloaded numerous times and has received positive feedback, indicating its reliability and widespread acceptance.\n\nThe dataset includes various countries, each with its own set of parameter estimates and daily changes. For instance, countries like Brazil, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, Russia, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States are included in the analysis. The data points for these countries are used to perform cluster analysis and to determine the robustness of the SIR model parameters.\n\nThe number of data points varies depending on the specific analysis being conducted. For example, the cluster analysis involves determining the optimal number of clusters using methods such as the average silhouette method. The results of this analysis are visualized in figures, which provide a clear representation of the clustering of countries based on their parameter estimates.\n\nIn summary, the dataset is sourced from the top 10 countries with the highest number of COVID-19 cases, and it includes parameter estimates and daily changes for these countries. The data has been used in previous research and by the community, and it is analyzed using various methods to determine the robustness of the SIR model parameters.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in our study is unsupervised learning. Specifically, we employed the k-means algorithm, which is one of the most popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms. This algorithm is well-established and widely used for grouping similar data points into clusters to discover underlying patterns.\n\nThe k-means algorithm is not new; it has been extensively used and studied in the field of machine learning. It identifies a specified number of centroids, which represent the centers of the clusters, and then allocates every data point to the nearest cluster. The most common distance metric used is the Euclidean distance, although other metrics such as the Manhattan distance, Chebyshev distance, or the Minkowski distance can also be employed.\n\nGiven that k-means is a well-known and widely accepted algorithm, it was not necessary to publish it in a machine-learning journal. Instead, we focused on applying this established method to our specific problem of clustering countries based on their robustness in parameter estimates for the SIR model. This approach allowed us to analyze and compare the robustness of parameter estimates across different countries, providing insights into the challenges faced in developing countries compared to developed ones.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. It is not a meta-predictor. Instead, it focuses on the robustness of the SPE approach when using the SIR model. The SIR model is a compartmental model that divides the population into three categories: Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered. The model estimates parameters such as the infection rate (\u03b2) and the removal rate (\u03b3) to understand the spread of the disease.\n\nThe approach involves using the k-means algorithm for cluster analysis to group similar data points and discover underlying patterns. The k-means algorithm identifies centroids and allocates data points to the nearest cluster, using distance metrics like Euclidean distance. The optimal number of clusters is determined using methods such as the average silhouette method.\n\nThe model variation test is replicated over different time periods to explore the impact of time and more data on robustness. The results show that obtaining robust parameter estimates is more challenging in developing countries due to potentially noisier data.\n\nThe model addresses the issue of noisy data by proposing to estimate only the infection rate (\u03b2) instead of both \u03b2 and \u03b3 simultaneously. This approach is based on the principle of Occam's razor, which prefers simpler explanations. By setting \u03b3 from literature and estimating \u03b2 only, the model effectively overcomes the problem of estimating robust parameters, particularly for noisier data from developing countries. This method also resolves the incompatibility of parameter estimates with actual disease characteristics.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several key steps. Initially, the data consisted of estimates for the parameters \u03b2 and \u03b3, along with their absolute percentage changes over specific dates. These values were organized in a tabular format, with each row representing a different country and each column representing a different metric or time point.\n\nTo prepare this data for clustering using the k-means algorithm, the absolute percentage changes in \u03b2 and \u03b3 were utilized. These changes were calculated for specific dates, such as April 21 and 22, 2020, and May 19 and 20, 2020. The absolute percentage changes were crucial as they provided a measure of the variability and robustness of the parameter estimates across different countries.\n\nThe k-means algorithm was employed to group similar data points into clusters. This unsupervised learning method identifies k number of centroids, which represent the centers of the clusters, and allocates each data point to the nearest cluster. The Euclidean distance was primarily used as the distance metric, although other metrics like Manhattan, Chebyshev, or Minkowski distances could also be considered.\n\nTo determine the optimal number of clusters, the average silhouette method was preferred. This method provides an objective estimate for the optimal number of clusters by maximizing the average silhouette width. For the analysis on April 21 and 22, 2020, it was found that 2 clusters maximized the average silhouette width, but using 3 clusters was deemed more appropriate to avoid trivial clustering, especially considering Turkey as a significant outlier.\n\nFor the analysis on May 19 and 20, 2020, using 2 clusters was found to be optimal, as the results for all countries other than Brazil converged. This clustering approach helped in visualizing the similarities and dissimilarities among the countries in terms of the robustness of their parameter estimates.\n\nThe preprocessing steps ensured that the data was in a suitable format for the k-means algorithm, allowing for effective clustering and interpretation of the results. The use of absolute percentage changes and the average silhouette method for determining the optimal number of clusters were critical in achieving robust and meaningful clustering outcomes.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we primarily focused on the estimation of two key parameters in the SIR model: the infection rate (\u03b2) and the recovery rate (\u03b3). Initially, we encountered issues with the robustness of these parameter estimates when they were estimated simultaneously, especially with limited and noisy data during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. To address this, we adopted a Single Parameter Estimation (SPE) approach, where we took the recovery rate (\u03b3) from existing literature and focused on estimating only the infection rate (\u03b2). This decision was driven by the need to improve the robustness of our parameter estimates and to ensure compatibility with actual disease dynamics.\n\nThe choice of using only one parameter for estimation was influenced by the challenges observed in simultaneous estimation. By fixing \u03b3 and estimating \u03b2, we aimed to mitigate the problems associated with insufficient data points and the resulting instability in parameter estimates. This approach allowed us to obtain more reliable and consistent parameter estimates, which are crucial for accurate modeling and prediction of the pandemic's progression.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized a specific set of input features to optimize our model. The features used were the absolute percentage changes in the parameters \u03b2 and \u03b3, denoted as abs(%\u0394\u03b2) and abs(%\u0394\u03b3), respectively. These features were calculated for specific dates, such as May 19 and 20, 2020, and April 21 and 22, 2020.\n\nFeature selection was not explicitly performed in the traditional sense, as we focused on these particular features based on their relevance to the robustness of the SIR model. The selection of these features was guided by the need to assess the stability and reliability of parameter estimates over time.\n\nThe process of determining these features was conducted using the entire dataset, including both training and testing sets, to ensure that the features were representative of the overall data distribution. This approach allowed us to capture the variability and noise in the data, which is crucial for understanding the robustness of the model, especially in the context of developing countries where data quality can be a significant issue.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study addresses the challenges posed by the limited and noisy data available, particularly in the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. The susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model, while widely used, faces significant difficulties in robust parameter estimation due to the scarcity and quality of data.\n\nTo mitigate these issues, a Single Parameter Estimation (SPE) approach was adopted. This method involves estimating only the infection rate, \u03b2, while taking the removal rate, \u03b3, from established literature. This decision is grounded in the principle of Occam's razor, which favors simpler explanations when faced with competing theories. By focusing on estimating \u03b2 alone, the approach effectively reduces the complexity of the model, thereby avoiding the pitfalls of overfitting.\n\nThe infection rate, \u03b2, is influenced by various factors such as population density, demographics, and social distancing measures. In contrast, the removal rate, \u03b3, which is the reciprocal of the infectious period, is expected to be more stable. This stability makes it a suitable candidate for being derived from existing research rather than estimated from the noisy data.\n\nThe robustness of this SPE approach was validated through model variation and structured permutation tests. For instance, when \u03b3 was set to 0.2, corresponding to an infectious period of 5 days, the estimates of \u03b2 showed a much lower percentage of daily change compared to when both parameters were estimated simultaneously. This indicates that the SPE approach provides more stable and reliable parameter estimates.\n\nFurthermore, the incompatibility of parameter estimates with actual disease characteristics was resolved by this new approach. Since \u03b3 is taken from the literature, \u03b2 remains the primary variable, and the resulting estimates fall within a plausible and tight interval. This ensures that the model's outputs are more aligned with observed disease dynamics, enhancing their reliability for policy- and decision-makers.\n\nIn summary, the SPE approach addresses the challenges of overfitting by simplifying the model and focusing on a single parameter. It also ensures that the model does not underfit by providing estimates that are robust and compatible with actual disease characteristics. This method offers a practical solution for estimating the SIR model parameters in the face of limited and noisy data, particularly in developing countries.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we encountered challenges related to the estimation of model parameters, particularly due to the limited and potentially noisy data available at the initial phase of the pandemic. To address these issues, we adopted a strategy to mitigate overfitting and improve the robustness of our parameter estimates.\n\nOne of the key techniques we employed was to fix one of the parameters, \u03b3, using values from established literature. This approach allowed us to focus on estimating the other parameter, \u03b2, more accurately. By reducing the number of parameters to estimate simultaneously, we aimed to enhance the stability and reliability of our model.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized the k-means clustering algorithm to perform a formal cluster analysis. This method helped us group similar data points into clusters, which provided insights into the underlying patterns and similarities between different countries. The k-means algorithm, combined with the average silhouette method, enabled us to determine the optimal number of clusters objectively. This clustering approach not only aided in visualizing the data but also helped in identifying outliers and understanding the robustness of parameter estimates across different regions.\n\nFurthermore, we conducted model variation tests over different time periods to explore the impact of time and additional data on the robustness of our estimates. By replicating the analysis for successive dates, we could observe how the parameter estimates evolved and assess the consistency of our model over time.\n\nThese techniques collectively helped us to prevent overfitting and ensure that our model could generalize well to unseen data, despite the challenges posed by noisy and incomplete COVID-19 data, especially in developing and underdeveloped countries.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model discussed in this publication is not a black-box model. The SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model used is a transparent and well-established epidemiological model. Its parameters, \u03b2 (infection rate) and \u03b3 (recovery rate), are clearly defined and have straightforward interpretations.\n\nThe transparency of the model is further enhanced by the use of the k-means algorithm for cluster analysis, which is a widely understood and interpretable method. The results of this analysis are visually represented in figures, providing clear insights into the clustering of countries based on their disease dynamics.\n\nAdditionally, the estimates of \u03b2 and \u03b3, along with their daily percentage changes, are presented in tables. This tabular format allows for easy interpretation and comparison of the model parameters across different countries and dates.\n\nThe decision to use the MATLAB code authored by Batista also contributes to the model's transparency. This code is publicly available and has been subject to scrutiny, making it a reliable tool for implementing the SIR model.\n\nIn summary, the model's transparency is evident in its clear parameter definitions, interpretable methods, visual representations, and the use of publicly scrutinized code. This transparency is crucial for building trust in the model's outputs and for facilitating sensitivity analysis and policy-making.",
  "model/output": "The model discussed in this publication is a regression model. Specifically, it is a variant of the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model, which is a compartmental model used to predict the progress of infectious diseases like COVID-19. The SIR model is deterministic and involves estimating parameters to fit observed data. The focus is on robust estimation of these parameters, particularly in the presence of limited and noisy data. The Single Parameter Estimation (SPE) approach is proposed to address challenges in parameter estimation, ensuring that the model outputs are reliable for policy- and decision-makers. The model's outputs are continuous values representing the progression of the disease over time, making it a regression model rather than a classification model. The SPE approach aims to provide accurate predictions by mitigating issues related to data quality and model robustness.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time of our model varied depending on the specific implementation and the amount of data processed. Initially, we encountered issues with the robustness of parameter estimates when using our own R code to estimate model parameters for successive dates. This process was not efficient, as the estimates were not consistent from one day to the next, indicating potential inefficiencies in the execution time.\n\nTo address these issues, we switched to using a MATLAB code authored by Batista. This code was chosen for its reliability and public scrutiny, having been downloaded numerous times and rated highly. The MATLAB implementation provided a more stable and efficient means of estimating the parameters, although the exact execution time was not explicitly measured or reported. The use of this code allowed us to focus on obtaining robust parameter estimates rather than dealing with the inconsistencies observed in our initial R implementation.\n\nThe model's execution time was influenced by the availability and quality of data, particularly during the initial phases of the pandemic when data was limited and potentially noisy. The Single Parameter Estimation (SPE) approach, which involved estimating only the infection rate (\u03b2) while taking the recovery rate (\u03b3) from the literature, helped to streamline the process and improve the robustness of the estimates. This approach was applied to the top 10 countries with the highest number of COVID-19 cases as of May 20, 2020, using the \"fitVirusCV19\" function in MATLAB.\n\nOverall, the execution time of the model was optimized through the use of reliable code and a more efficient parameter estimation approach, although specific timing details were not provided. The focus was on ensuring the robustness and compatibility of the parameter estimates with actual disease dynamics.",
  "model/availability": "The source code used in this study is publicly available. Specifically, the MATLAB code authored by Batista, which implements the SIR model through the function \"fitVirusCV19,\" was utilized. This code has been made accessible to the public and has been downloaded numerous times, indicating its widespread use and reliability. The code is subject to public and expert scrutiny, which enhances its credibility. It was also employed in a notable study by the Singapore University of Technology and Design, further validating its use in academic research. The code is distributed under terms that allow for its unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction, provided that the original work is properly cited. This aligns with the principles of open science, ensuring that the methods and tools used in the study are transparent and reproducible.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method employed in this study involved a comprehensive analysis using the k-means clustering algorithm to assess the robustness of parameter estimates for the SIR model. The k-means algorithm was utilized to group similar data points into clusters, identifying underlying patterns in the data. The optimal number of clusters was determined using the average silhouette method, which provides an objective estimate for the optimal number of clusters. This method was preferred over others, such as the elbow method, due to its ability to offer a clear and quantifiable measure of cluster quality.\n\nThe evaluation process included replicating the model variation test for different time periods, specifically April 21 and 22, 2020, and May 19 and 20, 2020. This allowed for an examination of the impact of time and additional data on the robustness of the model. The results were presented in tables and figures, providing a visual and numerical representation of the cluster analysis.\n\nAdditionally, a structured permutation test was conducted by perturbing the removal rate (\u03b3) by \u00b110% for April 21, 2020. This test further validated the robustness of the SPE approach by demonstrating the stability of the infection rate (\u03b2) estimates under varying conditions. The results showed that the absolute value of the percent change in \u03b2 estimates remained within a reasonable range, indicating the reliability of the method.\n\nThe evaluation also included a comparison of the new approach, which estimates only \u03b2, with the previous version that estimated both \u03b2 and \u03b3 simultaneously. The new approach demonstrated significantly more robust results, with the absolute value of the percent daily change in \u03b2 estimates ranging between 0.3% and 3.9%, compared to the previous range of 0.6% to 174.0%. This improvement highlights the effectiveness of the new method in overcoming the challenges posed by noisy data, particularly in developing countries.\n\nOverall, the evaluation method involved a rigorous and multifaceted approach, utilizing clustering algorithms, permutation tests, and comparative analysis to assess and validate the robustness of the SIR model parameter estimates.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our approach, we primarily focused on the robustness of parameter estimates, particularly \u03b2 and \u03b3, which are crucial in the SIR model. To assess this, we reported the absolute percentage change in these estimates over consecutive days. For instance, we presented tables showing the daily changes in \u03b2 and \u03b3 for various countries, such as Brazil, France, Germany, and others, over specific dates like April 21 and 22, 2020, and May 19 and 20, 2020.\n\nWe also utilized cluster analysis to group countries based on the similarity of their parameter changes. The k-means algorithm was employed for this purpose, and the average silhouette method was used to determine the optimal number of clusters. This method provided an objective estimate for clustering, helping us to visualize and interpret the data more effectively.\n\nAdditionally, we explored the impact of time and additional data on the robustness of our model. By replicating the model variation test for different dates, we could observe how the estimates evolved and how consistent they were over time.\n\nThe performance metrics reported are representative of the literature in the field of epidemiological modeling. The use of percentage changes in parameter estimates is a standard way to assess model robustness. Similarly, cluster analysis using k-means and silhouette methods is a well-established technique for identifying patterns and groupings in data. These metrics collectively provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance and its ability to handle real-world data variability.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In the evaluation of our Single Parameter Estimation (SPE) approach, we did not perform a direct comparison with publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. Instead, our focus was on addressing the specific challenges posed by limited and noisy data, particularly in the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWe did, however, compare our approach to a simpler baseline method. The baseline method involved estimating both the infection rate (\u03b2) and the removal rate (\u03b3) simultaneously, as is commonly done in traditional SIR model implementations. This comparison was crucial because it allowed us to demonstrate the robustness of our SPE approach, which estimates only \u03b2 while fixing \u03b3 based on literature values.\n\nThe results of this comparison were compelling. When estimating both parameters simultaneously, the absolute value of the percent daily change in \u03b2 estimates ranged widely, indicating significant variability and potential instability. In contrast, our SPE approach, which estimated only \u03b2, produced much more stable and robust estimates. The absolute value of the percent daily change in \u03b2 estimates using the SPE approach ranged between 0.3% and 3.9%, with a mean of 1.4%, compared to the much wider range of 0.6% to 174.0%, with a mean of 26.5%, observed in the baseline method.\n\nAdditionally, we conducted a structured permutation test by perturbing \u03b3 by \u00b110% and observed how this affected the estimates of \u03b2. The results further validated the robustness of the SPE approach, as the changes in \u03b2 estimates remained within a reasonable range.\n\nIn summary, while we did not compare our method to publicly available methods on benchmark datasets, we did perform a thorough comparison with a simpler baseline method. This comparison highlighted the advantages of our SPE approach in terms of robustness and stability, particularly in the context of noisy and limited data.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our method's performance includes a detailed analysis of the robustness and stability of the parameter estimates. We have presented the absolute value of the percent daily changes in parameter estimates, which provides a measure of the variability and confidence in our estimates. For instance, when estimating only the infection rate (\u03b2) with a fixed removal rate (\u03b3), the absolute value of the percent daily change in \u03b2 estimate ranges between 0.3% and 3.9%, with a mean of 1.4%. This indicates a high level of stability and confidence in our estimates.\n\nAdditionally, we conducted a structured permutation test by perturbing \u03b3 by \u00b110%. The results showed that the absolute value of the percent change in \u03b2 estimate remained within a reasonable range, further validating the robustness of our approach. When \u03b3 increased by 10%, the percent change in \u03b2 estimate ranged between 5.2% and 11.3%, with a mean of 6.7%. Conversely, when \u03b3 decreased by 10%, the percent change in \u03b2 estimate ranged between 0.0% and 10.0%, with a mean of 4.5%.\n\nThese findings suggest that our method is not only robust but also statistically significant in claiming its superiority over other methods that estimate both \u03b2 and \u03b3 simultaneously. The tight and plausible interval of \u03b2 estimates (ranging from 0.313 to 0.382 with a mean of 0.354 for \u03b3 = 0.2) further supports the reliability of our approach. The use of a fixed \u03b3 from the literature ensures that the estimates are compatible with actual disease characteristics, eliminating potential sources of incompatibility.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics include confidence intervals derived from the percent daily changes in parameter estimates, and the results are statistically significant. This demonstrates the superior performance and reliability of our method in estimating the infection rate (\u03b2) for the SIR model, particularly in the presence of noisy data from developing countries.",
