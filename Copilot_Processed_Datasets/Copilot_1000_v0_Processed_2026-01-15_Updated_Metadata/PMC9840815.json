  "dataset/availability": "The data used in this study is publicly available through the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset with the accession number GSE157859. This dataset includes high-throughput RNA sequencing data from COVID-19 patients, encompassing three types of RNA measurements: lncRNA, mRNA, and miRNA. The data covers patients with varying disease severities, including mild, moderate, and severe symptoms, and was collected during different stages of treatment, convalescence, and rehabilitation.\n\nThe data is freely accessible, allowing for unrestricted research re-use and analysis. This accessibility is part of a broader initiative to make COVID-19-related research widely available.

This extensive data collection enables robust analysis and the development of predictive models for COVID-19 severity and treatment stages. The data splits used in the study are validated through cross-validation techniques, specifically Leave One Out Cross Validation (LOOCV) and 10-fold cross-validation, to ensure the reliability and generalizability of the findings.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm discussed in this work is related to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, which is a well-established supervised machine learning algorithm initially designed for binary classification tasks. The primary objective of SVM is to find the best weight vector, which is normal to the hyperplane that separates the given data into two classes. This process involves solving an optimization problem.\n\nThe SVM algorithm used in this study is not new. It is a widely recognized and utilized method in the field of machine learning. The specific implementation involves two different SVMs: one with a polynomial kernel and another with a linear kernel. These kernels are employed to handle non-linear data, making the SVM versatile for various types of datasets.\n\nThe reason this algorithm is discussed in a pathology journal rather than a machine-learning journal is that the focus of this study is on applying machine learning techniques to solve specific problems in the field of pathology, particularly in the context of COVID-19 patient classification. The study aims to predict the severity stage and treatment stage of SARS-CoV-2 patients using different RNA molecules. The SVM algorithm, along with other machine learning models, is used to achieve this goal. The primary contribution of this work lies in the application of these algorithms to a novel dataset and the insights gained from this application, rather than the development of new machine learning algorithms.",
  "optimization/meta": "The study does not employ a meta-predictor. Instead, it utilizes individual machine learning algorithms to predict the severity stage and treatment stage of SARS-CoV-2 patients. The algorithms used include Support Vector Machine (SVM) with polynomial and linear kernels, Na\u00efve Bayes classifier, Decision Tree, Random Forest classifier, K-nearest neighbor classifier (KNN), and Perceptron. Each of these algorithms is applied independently to the selected features derived from lncRNA, miRNA, and mRNA data.\n\nThe features used in the models are selected using methods such as feature importance, mutual information, and identification of differently expressed genes. These features are then individually fed into the seven different machine learning algorithms to determine the best-performing model.\n\nThe study ensures that the training data is independent by using Leave One Out Cross Validation (LOOCV) due to the limited number of samples. Additionally, 10-fold cross-validation is also performed to confirm the outcomes, with the results presented in the supplementary material. This approach helps in validating the models and ensuring that the predictions are robust and reliable.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data used in this study was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset with the accession number GSE157859. This dataset includes measurements of three different types of RNA molecules: lncRNA, mRNA, and miRNA. The data was collected from COVID-19 patients exhibiting mild, moderate, and severe disease symptoms, and it includes longitudinal whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing from peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples taken during various stages of treatment, convalescence, and rehabilitation.\n\nGiven the wide range of data, the first step in preprocessing was feature scaling. Min-max scaling was employed to normalize the data, ensuring that all features were scaled between 0 and 1. This step was crucial to reduce the differences in expression levels across the dataset.\n\nTwo feature selection methods were applied to the scaled data: mutual information and feature importance. Mutual information was used to calculate the dependency between variables, helping to identify the most relevant features. Feature importance, in conjunction with a random forest classifier, was also utilized to select the most significant features. Additionally, differently expressed genes between classes were identified and used as features.\n\nEighteen features were selected using these methods and were individually fed into seven different machine learning algorithms. This number was chosen because it was the minimum number of differently expressed genes identified in the classification of patients into their severity stage using lncRNA data. This uniformity in the number of features ensured consistency across all classifications.\n\nThe selected features were validated by comparing them with features from existing studies and performing Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. The results confirmed that the selected features were highly relevant to COVID-19, its severity, and treatment. The performance of these features was then evaluated using various machine learning models, with the results presented in supplementary tables.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In this study, the number of features used in the model is consistently set to eighteen. This number was chosen because it represents the minimum number of differently expressed genes identified in the classification of patients into their severity stage using lncRNA data. To maintain uniformity across all classifications, this number was fixed, even though other subgroup studies identified a higher number of differently expressed genes.\n\nThe selection of these eighteen features involved two main methods: feature importance and mutual information. Feature importance was determined using a random forest classifier, which helped identify the most relevant features. Mutual information was used to measure the dependency between variables, ensuring that the selected features had a significant relationship with the target variables.\n\nAdditionally, the top eighteen differently expressed genes were also selected and used in the predictions. These genes were validated through a comparison with existing studies and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, which confirmed their relevance to COVID-19, its severity, and treatment.",
  "optimization/features": "In this study, eighteen features are used as input for the machine learning models. Feature selection was indeed performed using two different methods: mutual information and feature importance. These methods were applied to select the most relevant features from the dataset. The selection process was conducted using the training data only, ensuring that the models were validated on unseen data. This approach helps in maintaining the integrity of the validation process and prevents overfitting. The selected features were then used across various classification algorithms to predict the severity and treatment stages of COVID-19 patients.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The study involved a dataset with a significantly larger number of features compared to the number of samples. Specifically, the dataset included 3478 lncRNA, 21,773 mRNAs, and 903 miRNAs, but the number of samples was much smaller. To address the potential issue of overfitting due to the high dimensionality of the data, two feature selection methods were employed: mutual information and feature importance. These methods helped in identifying the most relevant features, reducing the dimensionality of the data and mitigating the risk of overfitting.\n\nTo further ensure the robustness of the models, leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) was used. This technique is particularly useful when the number of samples is limited, as it involves using a single sample as the validation set and the remaining samples as the training set. This process is repeated for each sample in the dataset, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance. Additionally, 10-fold cross-validation was also performed to confirm the outcomes, and the results are presented in the supplementary material.\n\nThe models were validated using accuracy as the primary performance metric. Accuracy was calculated as the ratio of true positives and true negatives to the total number of predictions. This metric provided a clear indication of the models' ability to correctly classify the samples into their respective categories.\n\nIn summary, the study employed feature selection techniques and cross-validation methods to address the challenges posed by the high dimensionality of the data and the limited number of samples. These steps helped in ruling out both overfitting and underfitting, ensuring the reliability and generalizability of the results.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed cross-validation techniques to prevent overfitting. Specifically, we used Leave-One-Out Cross Validation (LOOCV) due to the limited number of samples in our dataset. This method involves using a single observation from the original sample as the validation data, and the remaining observations as the training data. This process is repeated such that each observation in the sample is used once as the validation data. Additionally, we performed 10-fold cross-validation to confirm the outcomes, although these results are presented in the supplementary material. These cross-validation techniques help ensure that our models generalize well to unseen data and mitigate the risk of overfitting.",
  "optimization/config": "Not applicable",
  "model/interpretability": "The models employed in this study encompass a mix of both transparent and black-box approaches. Transparent models, such as decision trees and perceptrons, offer clear interpretability. Decision trees, for instance, operate by asking a series of yes/no questions based on feature values, making it straightforward to trace the decision-making process. The root node and subsequent branches provide a visual representation of how the model arrives at its predictions.\n\nPerceptrons, while simpler, also offer transparency through their linear decision boundary. The function of a perceptron is defined by a threshold, making it easy to understand how inputs are classified based on whether they exceed this threshold.\n\nOn the other hand, models like support vector machines (SVMs), especially those with non-linear kernels, and random forests are considered black-box models. SVMs, particularly with polynomial kernels, can be less interpretable due to the complexity of the hyperplane they create in higher-dimensional space. Random forests, although powerful, aggregate the results of multiple decision trees, making it challenging to interpret the contributions of individual features.\n\nNa\u00efve Bayes classifiers, while probabilistic, are relatively transparent. They assume feature independence given the target class, which simplifies the interpretation of how probabilities are calculated for each class.\n\nK-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifiers are also somewhat interpretable. They classify based on the majority class among the nearest neighbors, using distance measures like Euclidean distance. The number of neighbors (k) and their distances provide insights into the classification process.\n\nIn summary, the study utilizes a combination of interpretable and less interpretable models. Decision trees and perceptrons offer clear interpretability, while SVMs and random forests are more opaque. Na\u00efve Bayes and KNN classifiers fall somewhere in between, providing a balance of interpretability and complexity.",
  "model/output": "The model is a classification model. It is designed to categorize COVID-19 patients into different phenotypes, specifically their severity stage and treatment stage. Various machine learning algorithms were employed for this classification task, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Na\u00efve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Perceptron. The performance of these models was evaluated using accuracy as the primary metric.\n\nThe study utilized different types of RNA molecules\u2014long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA), microRNAs (miRNA), and messenger RNAs (mRNA)\u2014as features for classification. Eighteen features were selected based on different criteria, such as differentially expressed genes, feature importance, and mutual information. These features were then fed into the classification models to predict the phenotypes.\n\nThe results indicated that the Random Forest classifier generally yielded the highest accuracy for most feature selection methods and RNA types. For instance, in the severity stage prediction using lncRNA features selected by feature importance, the Random Forest classifier achieved an accuracy of 0.68. Similarly, in the treatment stage prediction using the same features, the Random Forest classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 0.87.\n\nOther classifiers also showed competitive performance. For example, the Decision Tree classifier performed well in the treatment stage prediction using miRNA features, achieving an accuracy of 0.77. The Na\u00efve Bayes classifier demonstrated strong performance in the severity stage prediction using mRNA features, with an accuracy of 0.76.\n\nCross-validation techniques, such as Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) and 10-fold cross-validation, were used to validate the models. LOOCV was particularly useful given the limited number of samples. The results from these validation methods confirmed the robustness of the classification models.\n\nIn summary, the model is a classification model aimed at predicting the severity and treatment stages of COVID-19 patients using various RNA molecules as features. The Random Forest classifier was found to be particularly effective, but other classifiers also showed promising results. The use of cross-validation ensured the reliability of the model's performance.",

  "model/availability": "The source code and data used in this study are publicly available. They can be retrieved from the GitHub repository at the following URL: https://github.com/pratheebaJ/multiRNA-COVID. The repository contains the necessary code to reproduce the results presented in the publication. The data used in the study is also included in the repository, allowing others to validate and build upon the findings. The availability of this resource supports transparency and reproducibility in research.",
  "evaluation/method": "In our study, the evaluation of the machine learning models was conducted using cross-validation techniques due to the limited number of samples available. Specifically, Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) was primarily used to validate the models. This method involves using a single observation from the original sample as the validation data, and the remaining observations as the training data. This process is repeated such that each observation in the sample is used once as the validation data.\n\nAdditionally, 10-fold cross-validation was also employed to confirm the outcomes obtained from LOOCV. In 10-fold cross-validation, the data is divided into 10 subsets, and the model is trained and validated 10 times, each time using a different subset as the validation data and the remaining 9 subsets as the training data. The results from this cross-validation process are presented in the supplementary material.\n\nThe performance of the models was measured using accuracy, which is defined as the ratio of the sum of true positives and true negatives to the total number of predictions made. This metric provides a comprehensive evaluation of the models' ability to correctly classify the samples into their respective categories.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In this study, the primary performance metric reported is accuracy. Accuracy is defined as the ratio of correctly predicted instances (both true positives and true negatives) to the total number of instances. This metric is used to evaluate the performance of various machine learning models in predicting the severity and treatment stages of SARS-CoV-2 patients.\n\nThe accuracy values are determined using Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV), which is chosen due to the limited number of samples available. Additionally, 10-fold cross-validation is also employed to confirm the outcomes, with the results presented in the supplementary material. The maximum accuracies obtained do not show significant variations between the different cross-validation techniques.\n\nThe reported accuracies are competitive and comparable to those found in the literature. For instance, the highest accuracy achieved in severity stage prediction is 0.87 using lncRNA features with a random forest classifier. Similarly, in treatment stage prediction, lncRNA features also yield the highest accuracy of 0.87 with the same classifier. These results indicate that the selected features and models are effective in predicting the phenotypes of SARS-CoV-2 patients.\n\nThe use of accuracy as the primary metric is justified by the binary classification nature of the tasks (severity stage and treatment stage prediction). However, it is important to note that accuracy alone may not provide a complete picture of model performance, especially in imbalanced datasets. Future work could consider additional metrics such as precision, recall, and the F1 score to provide a more comprehensive evaluation.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In this study, a comparison of different machine learning methods was performed to evaluate their effectiveness in predicting the severity stage and treatment stage of SARS-CoV-2 patients using various RNA molecules. Seven machine learning algorithms were compared: Support Vector Machine (SVM) with polynomial and linear kernels, Na\u00efve Bayes classifier, Decision Tree, Random Forest classifier, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier, and Perceptron. The performance of these algorithms was assessed using three different types of RNA molecules: lncRNA, miRNA, and mRNA.\n\nThe comparison involved using feature selection techniques such as feature importance, mutual information, and differently expressed genes. Eighteen features were selected using each method to ensure uniformity across the classifications. These features were then individually fed into the seven machine learning models.\n\nThe performance of the algorithms was evaluated using accuracy as the primary metric. Leave-One-Out Cross Validation (LOOCV) was used due to the limited number of samples, and 10-fold cross-validation was also performed to confirm the results. The highest accuracies were achieved using the Random Forest classifier with feature importance-selected features, particularly for lncRNA and miRNA.\n\nThe study did not explicitly compare the methods to publicly available benchmarks or simpler baselines. Instead, it focused on evaluating the performance of different machine learning algorithms and feature selection techniques within the context of the specific RNA molecules and the given dataset. The results indicated that miRNA performed better than mRNA and lncRNA in predicting the severity stage, while lncRNA performed best in predicting the treatment stage. This suggests that other RNA molecules, such as miRNA and lncRNA, can provide more accurate predictions than mRNA in certain phenotype predictions.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the machine learning models in this study includes the use of leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) due to the limited number of samples. This method provides a robust estimate of model performance by using a single observation from the original sample as the validation data, and the remaining observations as the training data. This process is repeated such that each observation in the sample is used once as the validation data.\n\nThe performance metrics reported include accuracy, which is calculated as the ratio of true positives and true negatives to the total number of predictions. The highest accuracies achieved in the study are 0.87 for both severity stage and treatment stage predictions, using lncRNA and miRNA with feature importance and the random forest classifier. These results indicate strong performance, but it is important to note that confidence intervals for these metrics are not explicitly provided.\n\nStatistical significance is not explicitly discussed in the context of comparing the methods to each other or to baselines. However, the use of LOOCV and the consistent performance across different RNA molecules and feature selection methods suggest that the results are reliable. The supplementary material includes results from 10-fold cross-validation, which further supports the robustness of the findings. The maximum accuracies do not show significant variations between the different cross-validation techniques, indicating that the model performance is stable and not overly sensitive to the choice of validation method.\n\nIn summary, while confidence intervals are not provided, the use of LOOCV and the consistency of results across different validation techniques and RNA molecules lend confidence to the performance metrics reported. The statistical significance of the comparisons between methods is not explicitly addressed, but the overall robustness of the evaluation process supports the claim that the methods are effective.",
