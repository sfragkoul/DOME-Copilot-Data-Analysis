  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our study is a standard Q-learning algorithm, which falls under the class of reinforcement learning algorithms. This method is well-established and widely used in various fields for decision-making processes.\n\nThe Q-learning algorithm is not new; it has been extensively studied and applied in numerous research areas. The choice to use Q-learning in our work is driven by its effectiveness in handling sequential decision-making problems, which is particularly suitable for modeling the chemotactic navigation of sperm cells.\n\nThe reason this algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that our primary focus is on applying this established method to a specific biological problem\u2014sperm cell chemotaxis. The innovation lies in the application of Q-learning to this biological context rather than in the development of a new machine-learning algorithm. Our work contributes to the understanding of how sperm cells navigate chemical gradients, leveraging the strengths of Q-learning to develop effective navigation strategies.",
  "optimization/meta": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, the data encoding for the reinforcement learning algorithm involved several key steps to ensure effective navigation by the sperm cell model. The state of the reinforcement learning agent was specified by the sign of the change in the local chemical field, denoted as sgn(\u0394c_n), and the current path curvature, \u03ba_n. The change in the local chemical field, \u0394c_n, was determined by comparing the detected chemical field at the current learning step, c_n, with the previous step, c_n-1. This allowed the sperm cell to have a short-term memory of the detected chemical field, which is a feature observed in both bacterial and eukaryotic cells.\n\nThe path curvature, \u03ba_n, was mapped into a set of discrete states. Specifically, \u03ba_n was divided into 2X + 1 discrete states within the interval [\u03ba_0 - X\u03b4\u03ba, \u03ba_0 + X\u03b4\u03ba], where \u03ba_0 is the initial value of \u03ba at the start of the learning process, and \u03b4\u03ba is the difference in \u03ba between two consecutive states. The parameter X was chosen to be sufficiently large to ensure that \u03ba in our simulations did not reach the maximum or minimum value of the considered range.\n\nIn the 3D model, additional parameters were included to account for the more complex navigation environment. The state space of the reinforcement learning agent was expanded to include the torsion of the path, \u03c4_n, along with the sign of the change in the local chemical field and the local curvature. Similar to \u03ba, \u03c4 was mapped into 2X + 1 discrete states within the interval [\u03c4_0 - X\u03b4\u03c4, \u03c4_0 + X\u03b4\u03c4], where \u03c4_0 is the initial value of \u03c4 at the start of the learning process, and \u03b4\u03c4 is the difference in \u03c4 between two consecutive states.\n\nThe action space of the sperm cell included three main actions: adding \u03ba_n and \u03c4_n by \u03b4\u03ba and \u03b4\u03c4, deducting \u03ba_n and \u03c4_n by \u03b4\u03ba and \u03b4\u03c4, and keeping \u03ba_n and \u03c4_n unchanged. These actions allowed the sperm cell to modulate its trajectory in response to the detected chemical field. The reinforcement learning algorithm evaluated the best action to be taken at each learning step to move up the chemical gradient, thereby guiding the sperm cell toward the egg.\n\nThe parameters used in the simulations, such as \u03ba_0, \u03b4\u03ba, \u03b4t, and v, were carefully chosen to ensure realistic and accurate modeling of the sperm cell's navigation behavior. The initial position of the sperm cell, x(t = 0), was also specified to provide a starting point for the simulations. Through this encoding and preprocessing of the data, the reinforcement learning algorithm was able to effectively learn and optimize the navigation strategy of the sperm cell model.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized several key parameters to model the chemotaxis of sperm cells. The primary parameters include the initial curvature (\u03ba0), the change in curvature (\u03b4\u03ba), the time step (\u03b4t), the swimming speed (v), the initial position (x(t = 0)), the binding constant (\u03bb), and the variance of curvature noise (\u03c3\u03ba). These parameters were carefully selected based on biological plausibility and empirical data from previous studies on sperm cell motility.\n\nThe initial curvature (\u03ba0) and the change in curvature (\u03b4\u03ba) are crucial for determining the path of the sperm cell. These values were chosen to reflect the natural bending and flexibility of sperm flagella. The time step (\u03b4t) was selected to ensure that the model captures the dynamic changes in the sperm cell's trajectory over time. The swimming speed (v) was set to match observed velocities of sperm cells in experimental conditions.\n\nThe initial position (x(t = 0)) was chosen to provide a starting point for the simulations, allowing the sperm cell to navigate towards the egg. The binding constant (\u03bb) and the variance of curvature noise (\u03c3\u03ba) were selected to model the stochastic nature of chemotaxis, accounting for the random fluctuations in the chemical signals and the curvature of the sperm cell's path.\n\nThe selection of these parameters was guided by a balance between computational efficiency and biological accuracy. By tuning these parameters, we aimed to achieve a model that not only replicates the observed behavior of sperm cells but also provides insights into the underlying mechanisms of chemotaxis. The chosen values were validated through extensive simulations and comparisons with experimental data, ensuring that the model's predictions are robust and reliable.",
  "optimization/features": "The input features for the reinforcement learning model of sperm chemotaxis include the sign for the change in the local chemical field, the local curvature of the sperm's path, and the torsion of the path in the 3D case. In the 2D model, the state space is specified by the sign for the change in the local chemical field and the local curvature. The action space includes increasing the curvature by a small increment, decreasing it by the same increment, or keeping it unchanged. The model does not explicitly mention feature selection being performed. The features are derived from the physical properties of the sperm's movement and the chemical environment, ensuring that the model learns to navigate based on relevant biological factors. The learning process is designed to adaptively improve the navigation strategy over multiple episodes, utilizing the defined state and action spaces to optimize the sperm's path toward the egg.",
  "optimization/fitting": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed episode learning as a regularization method to prevent overfitting and enhance the navigation performance of the sperm cell model. This approach involves performing multiple learning episodes, where each episode consists of a series of learning steps. By increasing the number of episodes (Ne), the sperm cell's success rate in reaching the egg improves significantly. For instance, in the 2D model, a 100% success rate is achieved at Ne = 10, demonstrating the progressive improvement in chemotaxis strategies through episode learning.\n\nAdditionally, we tested the sensitivity of learning parameters on the success rate, focusing on the success rate at Ne = 1. We performed simulations with different values of \u03b4\u03ba (the change in curvature) and \u03b4t (the time step). The results showed a non-monotonic change in the success rate with increased \u03b4\u03ba, indicating that an optimal range of \u03b4\u03ba exists for maximizing the success rate. Furthermore, a small \u03b4t may not be beneficial for navigation, as it takes time to observe the effect of an action on the detected chemical concentration.\n\nIn the 3D model, the state space and action space of the reinforcement learning algorithm were modified to account for additional parameters, such as the torsion of the path (\u03c4). The action space includes adding, deducting, or keeping \u03ba and \u03c4 unchanged, with the possibility of modulating \u03ba and \u03c4 in phase or out of phase. The overall learning performance in the 3D cases is similar to the 2D cases, with the cell eventually determining an effective navigation strategy to steer its helical trajectory toward the egg.\n\nIn summary, episode learning serves as an effective regularization method in our study, preventing overfitting and improving the navigation performance of the sperm cell model in both 2D and 3D cases. The sensitivity analysis of learning parameters further highlights the importance of selecting appropriate values for \u03b4\u03ba and \u03b4t to optimize the success rate.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters used in our study are reported within the publication. Specifically, parameters such as initial curvature (\u03ba0), curvature change (\u03b4\u03ba), time step (\u03b4t), and velocity (v) are detailed in the context of the experiments described. These parameters are crucial for understanding the reinforcement learning process and the navigation strategies of the sperm cell model.\n\nThe optimization schedule is implicitly described through the learning process, which involves multiple episodes (Ne) and learning steps (Nt). The progressive improvement in chemotaxis strategies over increased episodes is illustrated, showing how the model develops an effective navigation strategy.\n\nRegarding the availability of model files and optimization parameters, the publication does not explicitly mention the provision of these files. However, the detailed description of the parameters and the learning process provides a clear framework for replicating the experiments. The use of standard reinforcement learning techniques and the provision of key parameters should enable researchers to implement similar models.\n\nThe license under which these configurations and parameters are made available is not specified in the publication. Typically, scientific publications allow for the use of described methods and parameters for research purposes, but specific licensing details would need to be confirmed through the publisher or the authors.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a blackbox but rather a transparent one, as it is based on a reinforcement learning algorithm that can be interpreted and understood through its components and parameters.\n\nThe state space of the reinforcement learning agent is clearly defined by the sign for the change in the local chemical field, the local curvature, and the torsion of the path. These states are mapped into discrete intervals, making the model's internal representations interpretable.\n\nThe action space is also well-defined, consisting of actions that modulate the curvature and torsion of the sperm cell's trajectory. These actions include adding, deducting, or keeping the curvature and torsion unchanged, providing a clear understanding of how the model makes decisions.\n\nThe learning process is progressive and can be observed through the changes in the cell's trajectory, relative distance to the egg, and variations in curvature and torsion over increased learning steps. This allows for a clear interpretation of how the model improves its navigation strategy over time.\n\nAdditionally, the model's parameters, such as the binding constant, curvature noise, and other physical constants, are explicitly stated and can be adjusted to observe their effects on the model's behavior. This transparency allows for a deep understanding of the model's inner workings and the underlying biological processes it simulates.\n\nIn summary, the model is transparent and interpretable, with clear definitions of its state and action spaces, progressive learning processes, and explicit parameters that can be adjusted and observed. This transparency is crucial for understanding the model's behavior and its implications for the biological processes it simulates.",
  "model/output": "The model discussed in this publication is a reinforcement learning model designed for simulating sperm chemotaxis. It is primarily a regression model, as it aims to predict continuous outputs, such as the trajectory, relative distance, and curvature of the sperm cell's path over time. The model learns to adjust these continuous variables to navigate towards the egg efficiently.\n\nThe learning process is divided into episodes, each consisting of multiple learning steps. Through these steps, the model accumulates information about the chemical field and develops an effective navigation strategy. The performance of this strategy is evaluated based on how quickly and accurately the sperm cell can reach and orbit around the egg.\n\nThe model's output includes the trajectory of the sperm cell, the relative distance between the sperm cell and the egg, and the variation in path curvature. These outputs are used to assess the effectiveness of the chemotaxis strategy developed by the reinforcement learning algorithm. The model's performance is further improved through episode learning, where the sperm cell's navigation strategy becomes more efficient with increased episodes.\n\nIn summary, the model is a regression model that predicts continuous outputs related to the sperm cell's movement and navigation strategy. The outputs are used to evaluate and improve the model's performance in simulating sperm chemotaxis.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time of the model varied depending on the strategy and conditions used. For the reinforcement learning model, it took approximately 101.9 seconds on average to approach the source within a distance of less than 50 micrometers. This was slightly faster than the stimulus-response model, which took around 134.4 seconds under similar conditions. The time required for the sperm cells to reach the egg was measured in learning steps, with each step lasting 0.5 seconds. The cumulative learning steps increased at a faster rate when noises were present, indicating that more time was needed for the model to converge under noisy conditions. Overall, the model's execution time improved with increased episodes of learning, demonstrating progressive enhancement in chemotaxis strategies.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method for the reinforcement learning approach in sperm chemotaxis involved several key steps and metrics to assess the performance and effectiveness of the navigation strategies.\n\nThe learning process was divided into episodes, with each episode consisting of a set number of learning steps. The model's performance was evaluated over multiple episodes to observe progressive improvements in navigation strategies. This episodic learning approach allowed the model to develop an effective chemotaxis strategy over time.\n\nA typical example of reinforcement learning in a 2D sperm model was illustrated, showing the trajectory of the sperm cell as it navigated towards the egg. The relative distance between the cell and the egg, as well as the path curvature, were monitored over increased learning steps. This provided a visual and quantitative assessment of the model's ability to steer towards the target.\n\nThe success rate of navigation was defined as the proportion of cells that successfully reached the egg within a specified time period. The threshold for success was set at a distance of 50 micrometers or less from the egg, which is consistent with the typical radius of an egg. The success rate improved significantly with increased episodes of learning, demonstrating the model's ability to achieve a 100% success rate over time.\n\nThe sensitivity of learning parameters, such as the change in curvature (\u03b4\u03ba) and the time step (\u03b4t), was also tested. Simulations were performed with different values of these parameters to observe their impact on the success rate. The results showed a non-monotonic change in success rate with increased \u03b4\u03ba, indicating an optimal range for these parameters to achieve the best navigation performance.\n\nThe navigation performance was compared with that of a stimulus-response model proposed by Friedrich and J\u00a8ulicher. Both models exhibited periodic modulations in path curvature and reached the target at similar times, but the reinforcement learning model displayed a more curvy path with larger curvature values.\n\nAdditionally, the impact of noise on navigation performance was evaluated. Simulations were conducted with and without noise to assess how signal and curvature noises affected the sperm cell's trajectory and the time required to reach the egg. The results showed that noise introduced more variability into the trajectory, requiring a longer time to reach the target.\n\nOverall, the evaluation method involved a combination of visual trajectory analysis, quantitative metrics such as success rate and time to target, and sensitivity analysis of learning parameters. This comprehensive approach provided a robust assessment of the reinforcement learning model's effectiveness in sperm chemotaxis.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our reinforcement learning approach for sperm chemotaxis, several key performance metrics are reported to assess the effectiveness and robustness of the navigation strategies.\n\nFirstly, the time required for the sperm cells to approach the egg is measured. Specifically, the time taken to reach a distance of less than 50 micrometers from the egg is recorded. This metric is crucial for comparing the efficiency of different strategies, such as the reinforcement learning model and the stimulus-response model. The results indicate that the reinforcement learning model achieves this goal slightly faster than the stimulus-response model, demonstrating its efficiency.\n\nSecondly, the success rate of navigation is evaluated. This metric is defined as the proportion of cells that successfully reach the egg within a specified time period, set at 25,000 seconds. Success is determined when the cell circles around the egg stably with a radius of 50 micrometers or less. The success rate improves significantly with episode learning, eventually reaching 100% after sufficient episodes. This metric is representative of the model's ability to develop effective chemotaxis strategies over time.\n\nAdditionally, the sensitivity of learning parameters on the success rate is analyzed. Different values of \u03b4\u03ba (curvature change) and \u03b4t (time step) are tested to understand their impact on navigation performance. The success rate follows a non-monotonic change with increased \u03b4\u03ba, highlighting the importance of selecting optimal values for these parameters. This analysis provides guidance for choosing appropriate learning steps to maximize success rates.\n\nThe robustness of the reinforcement learning approach under noise is also assessed. The number of learning steps required for the sperm cells to reach the egg is measured, both with and without noise. The cumulative learning steps required for cells with noise increase at a faster rate, indicating that noise affects the learning process. However, the reinforcement learning algorithm demonstrates robustness by achieving a stable navigation performance even in the presence of noise.\n\nOverall, the reported performance metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the reinforcement learning approach for sperm chemotaxis. These metrics are representative of the literature, focusing on key aspects such as time efficiency, success rate, parameter sensitivity, and robustness under noise. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method in developing successful chemotaxis strategies.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our evaluation, we conducted a comparison between our reinforcement learning approach and a stimulus-response model proposed by Friedrich and J\u00a8ulicher. This comparison was performed to benchmark the effectiveness of the chemotactic navigation strategy obtained through reinforcement learning.\n\nThe stimulus-response model exhibited a smooth, spiral trajectory toward the source, while our reinforcement learning model displayed a curvier path with relatively larger curvature values. Despite these differences in trajectory, both strategies demonstrated roughly periodic modulations of curvature and reached the source in similar times.\n\nTo ensure a fair comparison, we performed 10 sets of simulations with the same initial distance from the source but different initial orientations for each model. This allowed us to assess the robustness and consistency of each strategy under varying conditions.\n\nAdditionally, we compared the success rate of navigation between the two strategies. The reinforcement learning model achieved a slightly faster approach to the source compared to the stimulus-response model. This preliminary comparison indicates that our reinforcement learning approach can capture the salient features of nearly periodic curvature modulation observed in experimental data, providing an effective strategy for sperm chemotaxis.\n\nWhile we did not use publicly available benchmark datasets, our comparison with a well-established stimulus-response model provides a strong validation of our method's performance. The use of different initial orientations and the measurement of success rates further strengthen the reliability of our findings.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the reinforcement learning approach for sperm chemotaxis includes several performance metrics with associated confidence intervals. For instance, the time required for the sperm model to approach the egg using reinforcement learning is reported as 101.9 \u00b1 5 seconds, indicating the mean and standard error of the mean (SEM). This provides a measure of the variability and confidence in the reported time.\n\nSimilarly, the success rate of navigation is evaluated over multiple simulations, with results showing the proportion of cells that successfully reach the egg within a specified time period. For example, at different numbers of episodes (Ne), the success rates are reported as 20/50, 41/50, and 50/50, demonstrating progressive improvement through episode learning. These results are visually represented in scatter plots, which help in understanding the distribution and consistency of the outcomes.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis of learning parameters, such as \u03b4\u03ba and \u03b4t, is also conducted with multiple simulations (100 for each case), and the success rates are presented with different colored bars to represent various \u03b4t values. This analysis shows non-monotonic changes in success rates with increasing \u03b4\u03ba, highlighting the complexity in choosing optimal learning parameters.\n\nStatistical significance is implied through the use of mean and SEM values, which provide a basis for comparing the performance of different strategies. The comparison between the reinforcement learning model and the stimulus-response model shows that the former is slightly faster in reaching the egg, with a reported time of 101.9 \u00b1 5 seconds compared to 134.4 \u00b1 8.4 seconds for the latter. This difference, along with the confidence intervals, suggests that the reinforcement learning approach is statistically superior.\n\nAdditionally, the robustness of the reinforcement learning approach is tested under the influence of signal noise and curvature noise. The cumulative learning steps required for cells to reach the egg are compared with and without noises, showing that while noises increase the learning steps, the algorithm still achieves robust navigation performance. This evaluation further supports the reliability and effectiveness of the reinforcement learning method in realistic conditions.",
