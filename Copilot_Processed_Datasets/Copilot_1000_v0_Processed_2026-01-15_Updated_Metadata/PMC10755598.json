  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was collected from children, with measurements taken by well-trained medical staff. The study involved 259 participants, divided into two groups: 88 children with normal weight and 171 children with obesity. Various physical measurements were taken, including height, weight, waist circumference, and body mass index (BMI). Additionally, laboratory examinations were conducted, including blood tests to measure fasting blood glucose and insulin levels, and analyses of acylcarnitine and organic acids in urine.\n\nThe data collected included anthropometric measurements, laboratory examination results, and metabolite analyses. The anthropometric measurements were taken using standardized procedures, ensuring accuracy and consistency. The laboratory examinations involved blood samples taken after a 12-hour fast, with specific methods used to measure glucose and insulin levels. Metabolite analyses were performed using advanced techniques such as liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry.\n\nThe dataset has not been previously used in other published papers or by the community. The study provides new insights into the relationships between childhood obesity, metabolites, and insulin resistance, contributing to the existing body of knowledge in this field. The data were analyzed using statistical methods and machine learning techniques to identify key metabolites associated with obesity and insulin resistance. The findings highlight the potential of these metabolites in predicting insulin resistance in children, offering implications for the prevention and treatment of childhood obesity and its complications.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in this study is the random forest (RF) model, which falls under the category of ensemble learning algorithms. This model is not new; it is a well-established method in the field of machine learning. The RF model operates by constructing multiple decision trees during the training phase and then making predictions based on the majority vote of these trees. This approach helps to improve the accuracy and robustness of the model by reducing overfitting and increasing generalization.\n\nThe RF model was chosen for its ability to handle complex datasets and provide reliable predictions. It is particularly useful for identifying important variables and assessing their impact on the outcome, which is crucial for understanding the relationships between childhood obesity, metabolites, and insulin resistance (IR).\n\nThe decision to use the RF model in this context, rather than publishing it in a machine-learning journal, is driven by the specific goals of the study. The focus here is on applying established machine-learning techniques to address biological and medical questions, rather than developing new algorithms. The RF model's effectiveness in predicting IR and identifying key metabolites makes it a suitable choice for this research. The implementation of the RF model was carried out using the \"random forest\" package in R, version 3.2.2, ensuring that the analysis was conducted with a well-supported and widely-used tool.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employed in this study is a random forest (RF) model, which is an ensemble learning method. It operates by constructing multiple decision trees during the training phase and makes predictions based on the majority vote of these trees. The RF model was used to predict the importance of metabolites to childhood insulin resistance (IR).\n\nThe RF model utilized data from various metabolites, specifically amino acid metabolites and fatty acid metabolites. The importance of these metabolites was ranked using the RF model. The top three amino acid metabolites identified were glutamine, tyrosine, and alanine. For fatty acid metabolites, the top three were pyruvic-ox-2, ethylmalonic-2, and phenyllactic-2.\n\nThe RF model was implemented using the \"random forest\" package in R, version 3.2.2. The dataset was subjected to 10-fold cross-validation to ensure the robustness of the model. The performance of the model was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The combined efficacy of BMI-SDS and the top three amino acid metabolites in predicting IR reached 80.0% (AUC = 0.800, 95% CI: 0.746, 0.854). For fatty acid metabolites, the AUC of BMI-SDS combined with the top three fatty acid metabolites was 76.6% (AUC = 0.766, 95% CI: 0.709, 0.824). Finally, the combined efficacy of BMI-SDS with the top three amino acid metabolites and the top three fatty acid metabolites in predicting IR reached 80.4% (AUC = 0.804, 95% CI: 0.750, 0.857).\n\nThe training data for the RF model was derived from a study population of children aged between 6 and 14 years old, treated in the department of children's health care and endocrinology. The study excluded individuals with pathological obesity due to genetic diseases, metabolic diseases, and neuroendocrine diseases. The data was collected and analyzed with the approval of the Ethics Committee of Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. The purpose of the study was explained to the parents of the participants, and informed consent was obtained.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure the data was suitable for analysis. Initially, metabolites with a detection rate of less than 30% were excluded to enhance data quality. For metabolites with a skewed distribution, a square root transformation was applied to correct the skewness. This transformation helped in normalizing the data, making it more suitable for statistical analysis.\n\nQuantitative analysis of acylcarnitine was performed using specialized software, which calculated the concentration based on ion peaks and the intensity of internal standards. Organic acids in urine were analyzed using gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS), and the data was processed using GC\u2013MS solution software to obtain semiquantitative results.\n\nStatistical tests, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, were used to assess the normality of the quantitative data. Data conforming to a normal distribution were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) and compared using t-tests. For skewed data, the median (P25, P75) was used for representation, and comparisons were made using the Mann\u2013Whitney U test. Qualitative data were expressed as frequencies (%) and compared using the chi-square test.\n\nFor the machine-learning algorithm, specifically the random forest (RF) model, the data set was prepared with 10-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness. The RF model was implemented using the \"random forest\" package in R. The model's performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), which provided a measure of the model's effectiveness in predicting insulin resistance (IR) in children. The AUC values indicated the combined efficacy of different metabolites in predicting IR, with higher values signifying better predictive performance.",
  "optimization/parameters": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/features": "The study utilized a combination of anthropometric measurements and metabolite data as input features. The anthropometric measurements included body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR). These measurements were used to assess the physical characteristics of the participants.\n\nIn addition to the anthropometric data, the study analyzed 195 metabolites using liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry. Out of these, 111 metabolites with a detection rate higher than 30% were included in the analysis. These metabolites were further categorized into amino acid metabolites and fatty acid metabolites.\n\nFeature selection was performed to identify the most relevant metabolites associated with childhood obesity and insulin resistance (IR). This process involved using statistical methods such as multiple linear regressions, Spearman correlation, and random forest (RF) models. The RF models were particularly useful in ranking the importance of differential metabolites.\n\nThe feature selection process ensured that only the most significant metabolites were considered for further analysis. This step was crucial in reducing the dimensionality of the data and focusing on the key metabolites that had the strongest associations with the outcomes of interest.\n\nThe final set of input features included the top-ranked metabolites from both the amino acid and fatty acid categories, along with the BMI standard deviation score (BMI-SDS). These features were used to build predictive models for IR, with the combined efficacy of BMI-SDS and the top three amino acid metabolites reaching 80.0% in predicting IR. Similarly, the combined efficacy of BMI-SDS and the top three fatty acid metabolites reached 76.6%. The overall combined efficacy of BMI-SDS with the top three amino acid metabolites and the top three fatty acid metabolites in predicting IR was 80.4%.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The study employed several statistical methods to ensure that the models were neither overfitting nor underfitting the data. The number of metabolites analyzed was substantial, but the use of techniques like orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and random forest (RF) models helped in managing the complexity.\n\nTo rule out overfitting, the OPLS-DA model was used to assess the difference in metabolites between the normal weight group and the obese group. This method is effective in handling high-dimensional data by reducing the risk of overfitting. Additionally, the RF model utilized 10-fold cross-validation, which is a robust technique for validating the model's performance and ensuring that it generalizes well to unseen data. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used as a performance index, providing a reliable measure of the model's effectiveness.\n\nTo address underfitting, the study ensured that the models were complex enough to capture the underlying patterns in the data. The RF model, in particular, is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees, which helps in capturing a wide range of patterns and interactions in the data. The inclusion of variable importance in project (VIP) scores and the use of nonparametric tests further ensured that the models were not too simplistic.\n\nThe combination of these methods provided a comprehensive approach to fitting the models, ensuring that they were neither overfitting nor underfitting the data. The results demonstrated the models' ability to distinguish between the normal weight and obese groups effectively, with significant differences in metabolites and reliable predictive performance.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our models. One of the key methods used was the orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) model. This model helps in assessing the differences in metabolites between groups by focusing on the relevant information and reducing the risk of overfitting.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized the random forest (RF) model, which is an ensemble learning method. This approach builds multiple decision trees during the training period and identifies classes based on the majority vote in the ensemble. The RF model's inherent structure helps in reducing overfitting by averaging the results of many trees, thereby providing a more stable and generalizable prediction.\n\nFurthermore, we performed 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of our models. This technique involves dividing the dataset into 10 subsets, training the model on 9 subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated 10 times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. Cross-validation helps in assessing the model's performance on unseen data and ensures that the results are not due to overfitting.\n\nIn summary, we implemented OPLS-DA, RF models, and 10-fold cross-validation to prevent overfitting and enhance the reliability of our findings.",
  "optimization/config": "Not applicable.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a black box; it is designed to provide insights into the relationships between childhood obesity, insulin resistance (IR), and specific metabolites. The random forest (RF) model, in particular, offers a level of transparency by ranking the importance of different metabolites. This ranking allows for the identification of key metabolites that are significantly associated with IR and obesity.\n\nFor instance, the RF model highlighted that among amino acid metabolites, glutamine, tyrosine, and alanine were particularly important. Similarly, in the category of fatty acid metabolites, pyruvic-ox-2, ethylmalonic-2, and phenyllactic-2 were identified as crucial. These rankings provide clear examples of how specific metabolites contribute to the model's predictions, making it more interpretable.\n\nAdditionally, the use of multiple linear regression and correlation analyses further enhances the transparency of the model. These statistical methods help to explore and confirm the relationships between childhood obesity, IR, and the identified metabolites. By combining these approaches, the study not only predicts the risk of IR but also offers a deeper understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in this study is primarily a classification model, specifically designed to predict the risk of insulin resistance (IR) in children. The random forest (RF) model was used to rank the importance of differential metabolites and to predict IR. The model's performance was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) of the relative operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The AUC values indicate the effectiveness of the model in distinguishing between children with and without IR. For instance, the combined efficacy of BMI-SDS and the top three amino acid metabolites in predicting IR reached an AUC of 80.0%, while the combined efficacy of BMI-SDS and the top three fatty acid metabolites reached an AUC of 76.6%. Additionally, the combined efficacy of BMI-SDS with the top three amino acid metabolites and the top three fatty acid metabolites in predicting IR reached an AUC of 80.4%. These results demonstrate the model's ability to classify children based on their risk of IR.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time for the model was not explicitly mentioned. However, the random forest (RF) model was implemented using the \"random forest\" package in R, version 3.2.2. The data set was adopted with 10-fold cross-validation, which is a computationally intensive process. The specific time taken for the model to run would depend on various factors such as the computational resources available, the size of the dataset, and the complexity of the model. Given the use of 10-fold cross-validation, it is reasonable to assume that the execution time was significant, but the exact duration is not specified.",
  "model/availability": "Not applicable.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method employed in this study involved a combination of statistical analyses and machine learning techniques to assess the associations between childhood obesity, metabolites, and insulin resistance (IR). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were used to evaluate the normality of quantitative data, guiding the choice of appropriate statistical tests for comparison between groups. For normally distributed data, t-tests were used, while the Mann\u2013Whitney U test was applied to skewed data. Qualitative data were analyzed using chi-square tests.\n\nTo identify differential metabolites between normal weight and obese groups, an orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) model was utilized. This model helped in visualizing and assessing the differences in metabolites between the two groups. Metabolites with a detection rate of less than 30% were excluded from the analysis. Square root transformation was performed on the metabolite data to correct for skewed distributions.\n\nMultiple linear regressions were conducted to explore the relationships between childhood obesity and various metabolites, with obesity as the independent variable and metabolites as dependent variables. Spearman correlation analysis was used to examine the associations between metabolites and IR among children. Significant univariate correlation analysis coefficients led to partial correlation analyses, adjusting for age, gender, and BMI.\n\nThe random forest (RF) model was applied to predict the importance of metabolites to childhood IR. This ensemble learning model builds multiple decision trees during training and identifies classes based on majority voting. The RF model was implemented using the \u201crandom forest\u201d package in R, with a 10-fold cross-validation approach.

An AUC value less than 0.05 based on two-tailed test results was considered statistically significant.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed several performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of our models. For the random forest (RF) models used to predict insulin resistance (IR), we primarily reported the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The AUC provides a single scalar value that represents the ability of the model to distinguish between classes, with higher values indicating better performance. Specifically, we reported AUC values for different combinations of metabolites and BMI-SDS to predict IR. For instance, the combined efficacy of BMI-SDS and the top three amino acid metabolites reached an AUC of 80.0%, while the combination of BMI-SDS and the top three fatty acid metabolites achieved an AUC of 76.6%. Additionally, the combined efficacy of BMI-SDS with the top three amino acid metabolites and the top three fatty acid metabolites in predicting IR reached an AUC of 80.4%.\n\nThese metrics are widely used in the literature for evaluating predictive models, particularly in the context of metabolic and health-related studies. The AUC is a robust metric that provides a comprehensive evaluation of model performance across all classification thresholds. By reporting AUC values, we ensure that our results are comparable to other studies in the field, allowing for a meaningful assessment of our model's predictive power.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "Not applicable. The study focused on analyzing metabolites and their associations with childhood obesity and insulin resistance (IR). It did not involve the development or evaluation of new methods or models that would require comparison to publicly available methods or simpler baselines on benchmark datasets. Instead, the study utilized established statistical and machine learning techniques, such as orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), random forest (RF) models, and various statistical tests, to analyze the data and draw conclusions about the relationships between metabolites, obesity, and IR. The performance of these techniques was evaluated within the context of the study's specific objectives and datasets, rather than through comparison to other methods or baselines.",
