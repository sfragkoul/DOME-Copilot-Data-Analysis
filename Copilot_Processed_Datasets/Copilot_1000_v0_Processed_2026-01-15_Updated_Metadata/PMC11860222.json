  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study consists of urine samples collected from patients with prostate cancer. The samples were obtained from two cohorts: a retrospective cohort and a prospective cohort. The retrospective cohort included urine samples from patients treated at collaborating hospitals in the US and Europe, primarily consisting of Caucasian patients. These samples were collected between July 2004 and November 2014, with follow-up through June 2015. The prospective cohort included samples from Chinese patients, collected between November 2014 and June 2018, with follow-up through March 2022.\n\nIn the retrospective cohort, a total of 571 urine samples were initially received, but 158 were excluded due to various reasons such as lack of pathology reports, diagnostic uncertainty, or insufficient gene expression data. This resulted in 413 samples being used for analysis. In the prospective cohort, 278 samples were collected, with 35 excluded for similar reasons, leaving 243 samples for analysis.\n\nThe urine samples were processed to extract RNA, and the expression levels of various genes were quantified using real-time qRT-PCR. The samples were collected without prior digital rectal examination to avoid affecting gene expression. Patient clinicopathological information was also obtained, and all samples were de-identified to protect patient privacy.\n\nThe data from these cohorts were used to develop and validate a 25-gene PLNM-Score classifier, which aims to accurately detect prostate cancer lymph node metastasis (PLNM) through a non-invasive urine test. The retrospective cohort served as the training set for developing the classifier, while the prospective cohort was used for validation. The classifier's performance was assessed using statistical methods, including univariate and multivariate discriminant analysis, and compared with existing clinical tools like the MSKCC nomogram score.",
  "dataset/splits": "The study utilized two primary data splits: a retrospective development cohort and a prospective validation cohort. The retrospective cohort consisted of 413 patients, with 20 of them having pelvic lymph node metastasis (PLNM) as diagnosed by pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND). The median number of lymph nodes dissected in this cohort was 6. The prospective cohort included 243 patients, with 76 of them developing distant metastasis during the median 6-year follow-up. The distribution of data points in each cohort reflects the different patient populations and clinical settings, with the retrospective cohort primarily consisting of Caucasian patients from the US and Europe, and the prospective cohort consisting of Chinese patients. This distribution allowed for a robust validation of the 25-Gene PLNM-Score across different ethnic groups and clinical contexts.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets used in this study were split into a retrospective cohort and a prospective cohort. The retrospective cohort, referred to as the IND-CHTN Cohort, consisted of 413 patients. This cohort was used as the training set to develop the 25-Gene PLNM-Score classifier. The prospective cohort, known as the Multi-Hospital Cohort, included 243 patients and served as the validation set to assess the performance of the classifier.\n\nThe training and test sets were independent. The retrospective cohort was composed of archived urine sediments collected from patients in the US and Europe, predominantly Caucasian. In contrast, the prospective cohort included fresh urine samples from Chinese patients. This geographical and demographic diversity helped ensure the independence of the datasets and the robustness of the classifier across different patient populations.\n\nTo enforce the independence of the datasets, the retrospective cohort was retrospectively collected from sample archives, while the prospective cohort involved prospectively and consecutively collected pre-biopsy urine samples. This approach minimized the risk of overlap between the two cohorts.\n\nThe distribution of the datasets compares favorably to previously published machine learning datasets in the context of prostate cancer research. The retrospective cohort had a median follow-up of 8 years, during which biochemical recurrence was assessed every 3 months. The prospective cohort had a median follow-up of 6 years, with imaging tests performed every 3 months to monitor the development of distant metastasis. These rigorous follow-up protocols ensured comprehensive data collection and accurate assessment of patient outcomes.\n\nThe retrospective cohort included 20 patients with PLNM out of 413, while the prospective cohort had 35 patients with PLNM out of 243. The median number of lymph nodes dissected was 6 in the retrospective cohort and 13 in the prospective cohort. These differences in the number of PLNM cases and lymph nodes dissected reflect the real-world variability in clinical practice and enhance the generalizability of the findings.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data underlying the article will be shared upon reasonable request to the corresponding author. This approach ensures that the data is accessible for verification and further research while maintaining control over its distribution. The corresponding authors for this study are Chang Zou and Jenny L. Persson. Interested parties can contact them to request access to the data. This method of data sharing allows for transparency and reproducibility of the research findings while adhering to ethical and legal considerations.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used is a random forest algorithm. This algorithm is not new, as it is a well-established method in the field of machine learning. The choice to use this algorithm was driven by its effectiveness in assembling selected features/variables into a classifier, which is crucial for distinguishing between pelvic lymph node metastasis (PLNM) and non-PLNM cases with high accuracy.\n\nThe random forest algorithm was selected for its robustness and ability to handle complex datasets, making it suitable for the task of developing a urine gene panel-based classifier. The parameters of the random forest, including mtry and nodesize, were further tuned using a grid search to optimize the accuracy of the classifier. This process ensured that the final algorithm, named the 25-Gene PLNM-Score (25 G PLNM-Score), was highly accurate and reliable for PLNM diagnosis.\n\nThe decision to use an established algorithm like random forest, rather than developing a new one, was likely influenced by the need for proven reliability and efficiency. Publishing in a machine-learning journal was not the primary focus of this study, as the main objective was to develop and validate a clinical tool for detecting PLNM in prostate cancer patients. The study's findings demonstrate the practical application of the random forest algorithm in a medical context, highlighting its potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model developed in this study is not a meta-predictor. It does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it relies on a single machine-learning method: a random forest algorithm. This algorithm was used to screen various combinations of prostate-specific candidate genes to form classifiers for distinguishing pelvic lymph node metastasis (PLNM) and non-PLNM. The gene expression levels in urine cell sediments were quantified by real-time qRT-PCR, and these levels were used directly by the random forest algorithm to calculate a classification score. The training data used for developing the algorithm was from a multi-center retrospective urine cohort, ensuring that the data was independent and specifically tailored for this purpose. The final algorithm, named the 25-Gene PLNM-Score, was validated in an independent prospective multi-hospital cohort, further confirming its accuracy and reliability.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several key steps. Initially, gene expression levels were quantified using real-time qRT-PCR in urine cell pellets collected without prior digital rectal examination. The cycle threshold (Ct) values of the genes were normalized using a housekeeping gene, beta-actin, to obtain CtS values. These CtS values were then used as input features for the random forest algorithm. The algorithm calculated a classification score for each patient, which was dichotomized using a cutoff value of 0 to classify patients as having pelvic lymph node metastasis (PLNM) or not. The size of the random forest was determined by the number of patients in the cohort, using more than half of the patient number for each tree. Bootstrap sampling was employed to randomly select subsets of genes from the training data to develop each tree in the forest. This process ensured that the algorithm could robustly distinguish between PLNM and non-PLNM cases. The classification score was then compared with the clinical diagnosis from pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) to assess the accuracy of the algorithm. This method allowed for the identification of the gene combination with the highest accuracy, leading to the development of the 25-Gene PLNM-Score.",
  "optimization/parameters": "The model utilizes a 25-gene panel, meaning 25 parameters are used. The selection of these parameters involved a screening process using a random forest machine learning algorithm. Various combinations of prostate-specific candidate genes were evaluated to identify the combination that provided the highest accuracy in distinguishing between pelvic lymph node metastasis (PLNM) and non-PLNM. The parameters, including mtry and nodesize, were further tuned through a grid search to optimize the accuracy of the algorithm. This process ensured that the selected genes and their respective parameters formed the most effective classifier for the diagnosis of PLNM.",
  "optimization/features": "The input features for the developed algorithm consist of the expression levels of 25 specific genes. These genes were selected through a rigorous process involving a random forest machine learning algorithm applied to various combinations of prostate-specific candidate genes. The feature selection was performed using the training set only, ensuring that the model's performance is evaluated on unseen data. This approach helps in identifying the most relevant genes that contribute significantly to distinguishing between PLNM and non-PLNM cases. The final set of 25 genes includes HIF1A, FGFR1, BIRC5, AMACR, CRISP3, FN1, HPN, MYO6, PSCA, PMP22, GOLM1, LMTK2, EZH2, GSTP1, PCA3, VEGFA, CST3, PTEN, PIP5K1A, CDK1, TMPRSS2, ANXA3, CCNA1, CCND1, and KLK3. These genes were found to exhibit the highest accuracy in the classification task, making them crucial for the 25-Gene PLNM-Score.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study utilized a random forest machine learning algorithm to develop a classifier for distinguishing between patients with pelvic lymph node metastasis (PLNM) and those without (non-PLNM). The algorithm was trained on a multi-center retrospective urine cohort, which included 413 patients, with 20 of them diagnosed with PLNM. The gene expression levels of various prostate-specific candidate genes were quantified using real-time qRT-PCR in urine cell pellets.\n\nTo address the potential issue of overfitting, given the relatively small number of PLNM cases compared to the number of genes, several strategies were implemented. First, a grid search was conducted to optimize the random forest parameters, including mtry (the number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split) and nodesize (the minimum size of terminal nodes). This process helped to fine-tune the model and reduce the risk of overfitting. Additionally, 10-fold cross-validation was performed to calculate the mean squared error of the classification algorithm with decreasing numbers of genes. Genes with the lowest 10% Gini Index were excluded in each iteration, ensuring that only the most relevant genes contributed to the final model. This iterative process helped to identify the optimal combination of genes, resulting in a 25-Gene Score algorithm with the highest accuracy.\n\nTo rule out underfitting, the diagnostic performance of the 25-Gene PLNM-Score was thoroughly evaluated. The score was dichotomized using a cutoff value to classify samples as PLNM or non-PLNM, and this classification was compared with the clinical diagnosis obtained through pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND). The diagnostic performance was assessed using univariate and multivariate discriminant analyses, which included measures such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and their respective 95% confidence intervals. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to further validate the model's performance. The high sensitivity (90%) and specificity (100%) observed in the retrospective cohort, along with an AUC of 0.93, indicated that the model was not underfitting the data.\n\nThe 25-Gene PLNM-Score was further validated in an independent prospective multi-hospital cohort consisting of 243 patients, with 35 diagnosed with PLNM. The same algorithm and classification cutoff value were used, and the results showed similarly high accuracy, with a sensitivity of 94%, specificity of 92%, and an AUC of 0.93. This validation step confirmed that the model generalizes well to new data, further supporting that underfitting was not a concern.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In the development of the 25-Gene PLNM-Score, several techniques were employed to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of the classifier. One of the key methods used was 10-fold cross-validation. This technique involves dividing the dataset into 10 subsets, training the model on 9 of these subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated 10 times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. By doing so, the model's performance is evaluated across different subsets of the data, reducing the risk of overfitting to any particular subset.\n\nAdditionally, feature selection was performed using the Gini Index. Genes with the lowest 10% Gini Index were excluded in each iteration, ensuring that only the most relevant features were included in the final model. This step helps in reducing the complexity of the model and prevents it from becoming too tailored to the training data, thereby improving its generalizability.\n\nThe random forest algorithm itself is inherently designed to reduce overfitting. It does this by creating multiple decision trees during training and outputting the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. This ensemble method helps to average out the errors made by individual trees, leading to a more robust and generalizable model.\n\nFurthermore, the parameters of the random forest, such as mtry (the number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split) and nodesize (the minimum size of terminal nodes), were tuned using a grid search. This optimization process helps in finding the best combination of parameters that minimize overfitting while maximizing the model's accuracy.\n\nThese techniques collectively ensure that the 25-Gene PLNM-Score is a reliable and accurate tool for distinguishing PLNM and non-PLNM, with a reduced risk of overfitting.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization schedule used in our study are detailed within the publication. Specifically, the random forest parameters, including mtry and nodesize, were tuned using a grid search to optimize the accuracy of the 25-Gene PLNM-Score algorithm. These details are provided in the methods section, where the development and validation of the 25-Gene PLNM-Score are described.\n\nThe model files and optimization parameters are not explicitly provided in the publication.

  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in this study is not a blackbox. The 25-Gene PLNM-Score algorithm is based on a random forest machine learning approach, which inherently provides some level of interpretability. The random forest algorithm combines multiple decision trees, each of which can be individually interpreted to understand how specific features (in this case, gene expressions) contribute to the final prediction.\n\nThe 25-Gene PLNM-Score specifically uses the RNA expression levels of 25 genes, including HIF1A, FGFR1, BIRC5, AMACR, CRISP3, FN1, HPN, MYO6, PSCA, PMP22, GOLM1, LMTK2, EZH2, GSTP1, PCA3, VEGFA, CST3, PTEN, PIP5K1A, CDK1, TMPRSS2, ANXA3, CCNA1, CCND1, and KLK3. These genes were selected through a screening process that evaluated various combinations to identify the most accurate predictors of pelvic lymph node metastasis (PLNM).\n\nThe random forest model allows for the assessment of feature importance, which indicates the contribution of each gene to the overall prediction. This means that it is possible to understand which genes are most influential in distinguishing between PLNM and non-PLNM cases. Additionally, the parameters of the random forest, such as mtry (the number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split) and nodesize (the minimum size of terminal nodes), were tuned to optimize the model's accuracy. This tuning process further enhances the model's interpretability by ensuring that the most relevant features are used in the decision-making process.\n\nThe diagnostic performance of the 25-Gene PLNM-Score was evaluated using measures such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. The model's high accuracy, with sensitivity and specificity both above 90%, and an area under the curve (AUC) exceeding 0.9, demonstrates its reliability and interpretability. The model's ability to spare a significant number of unnecessary pelvic lymph node dissections (PLND) while maintaining a low rate of missed PLNM cases further supports its clinical utility and interpretability.",
  "model/output": "The model developed is a classification model. It utilizes a random forest machine learning algorithm to distinguish between patients with pelvic lymph node metastasis (PLNM) and those without (non-PLNM). The algorithm generates a classification score based on the expression levels of 25 specific genes, which is then dichotomized using a cutoff value of 0 to categorize patients as either PLNM (score \u2265 0) or non-PLNM (score < 0). This classification is crucial for diagnosing PLNM in urine samples, providing high accuracy in distinguishing between the two groups. The model's performance was evaluated using measures such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and the area under the curve (AUC), demonstrating its effectiveness as a diagnostic tool.",

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the 25-Gene PLNM-Score involved several rigorous steps to ensure its accuracy and reliability.

The diagnostic performance was evaluated using univariate and multivariate discriminant analyses, which included measures such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and their respective 95% confidence intervals. Additionally, the rates of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative were calculated.\n\nThe receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted, and the area under the curve (AUC) with its 95% confidence interval was determined. The diagnostic performance of the 25-Gene PLNM-Score was also assessed in high-risk patients within both the retrospective and prospective cohorts. Univariate and multivariate discriminant analyses were conducted to compare its diagnostic performance with other established methods, such as the ISUP/Gleason grade, cancer stage, and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) nomogram score.\n\nKaplan-Meier plots were used to analyze biochemical recurrence-free survival and distant metastasis-free survival, stratified by the 25-Gene PLNM-Score, Gleason grade, cancer stage, and the MSKCC score. Log-rank P values were calculated using SPSS to assess the statistical significance of these survival analyses. This comprehensive evaluation ensured that the 25-Gene PLNM-Score is a robust and accurate tool for distinguishing PLNM and non-PLNM in prostate cancer patients.",
  "evaluation/measure": "The performance of the 25-Gene PLNM-Score was evaluated using several key metrics to ensure a comprehensive assessment of its diagnostic accuracy. These metrics include sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and their respective 95% confidence intervals. Additionally, the rates of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative were calculated to provide a detailed understanding of the test's performance.\n\nThe receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted, and the area under the curve (AUC) with its 95% confidence interval was calculated. The AUC is a crucial metric as it summarizes the overall ability of the test to discriminate between PLNM and non-PLNM cases. An AUC of 0.93 was reported, indicating a high level of accuracy.\n\nThe diagnostic performance was further assessed using univariate and multivariate discriminant analyses. These analyses help in understanding how well the 25-Gene PLNM-Score performs individually and in combination with other clinical factors. The sensitivity and specificity were found to be above 90%, which is notably higher than many existing methods.\n\nThe performance of the 25-Gene PLNM-Score was also compared with established clinical parameters such as ISUP/Gleason grade, cancer stage, and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) nomogram score. The comparison showed that the 25-Gene PLNM-Score outperformed these parameters, both individually and in combination, highlighting its superior diagnostic power.\n\nIn summary, the reported metrics provide a robust evaluation of the 25-Gene PLNM-Score's performance. The high sensitivity, specificity, and AUC, along with the comparison to existing methods, demonstrate that this test is a significant advancement in the diagnosis of PLNM.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "The evaluation of the 25-Gene PLNM-Score involved a comprehensive comparison with existing methods to assess its diagnostic performance. The score was compared with established clinicopathological parameters such as ISUP/Gleason grade and cancer stage, which showed extremely low specificity and AUC. When combined with the 25-Gene PLNM-Score in multivariate discriminant analysis, the accuracy significantly increased, with sensitivity and AUC reaching 100%.\n\nAdditionally, the 25-Gene PLNM-Score was compared with the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) nomogram score, a widely used tool in clinical practice. The MSKCC score had a low specificity and AUC, whereas the 25-Gene PLNM-Score demonstrated high sensitivity, specificity, and AUC in both retrospective and prospective cohorts. This direct comparison highlighted the superior diagnostic power of the 25-Gene PLNM-Score.\n\nThe study also considered the performance of various imaging tools, such as MRI, CT scan, PSMA PET/CT, and mpMRI, which have shown limited accuracy in detecting PLNM. The 25-Gene PLNM-Score outperformed these imaging methods, showing consistently high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity above 90% and an AUC exceeding 0.9 in two independent multi-center studies.\n\nFurthermore, the 25-Gene PLNM-Score was evaluated in high-risk patients within the retrospective and prospective cohorts. Univariate and multivariate discriminant analyses were conducted to compare its diagnostic performance with ISUP/Gleason grade, cancer stage, and the MSKCC nomogram score. The results confirmed the 25-Gene PLNM-Score's superior ability to stratify patients accurately, providing better clinical guidance for treatment decision-making.\n\nIn summary, the 25-Gene PLNM-Score was rigorously compared with simpler baselines and publicly available methods, demonstrating its robustness and accuracy in distinguishing PLNM and non-PLNM. This comprehensive evaluation underscores the potential of the 25-Gene PLNM-Score as a more accurate and reliable diagnostic tool compared to existing methods.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the 25 G PLNM-Score includes several performance metrics, all of which have associated confidence intervals. For instance, in the retrospective cohort, the sensitivity is reported as 90% with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 77\u2013103%, and the specificity is 100% with a 95% CI of 100\u2013100%. The area under the curve (AUC) is 0.93 with a 95% CI of 0.85\u20131.01. Similarly, in the prospective cohort, the sensitivity is 94% (95% CI: 87\u2013102%), specificity is 92% (95% CI: 89\u201396%), and AUC is 0.93 (95% CI: 0.87\u20130.99). These confidence intervals provide a measure of the reliability of the estimates.\n\nThe results demonstrate statistical significance, particularly when comparing the 25 G PLNM-Score with other methods. For example, the MSKCC score shows much lower specificity and AUC in the prospective cohort, with a specificity of 17% (95% CI: 12\u201322%) and an AUC of 0.73. This stark contrast highlights the superior performance of the 25 G PLNM-Score. Additionally, the combination of the 25 G PLNM-Score with ISUP/Gleason grade and cancer stage in multivariate discriminant analysis achieves perfect sensitivity and AUC, further validating its effectiveness.\n\nThe statistical analyses, including univariate and multivariate discriminant analyses, support the claim that the 25 G PLNM-Score is superior to existing methods. The consistent high performance across different cohorts and the significant differences in metrics compared to other tools indicate that the method is robust and reliable for clinical use.",
