  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset for this study was sourced from participants identified in a cognitive disorders\u2019 clinic through a medical records review, focusing on prior neuropsychological testing to fit the ADNI criteria for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or probable mild Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Additionally, community presentations on memory and aging were conducted to recruit cognitively unimpaired (CU) volunteers. Confirmation of group assignment was made using the ADNI classification battery, which included the Mini Mental Status Examination, the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale, and the Wechsler Memory Scale \u2013 Revised Logical Memory II.\n\nThe study initially included 121 participants, but data from one individual was excluded due to incomplete practice trials of the motor task. Therefore, 120 subjects were used for analyses with neuropsychological data. However, neuroimaging data were not available for 17 participants due to excessive artifact or brain atrophy, resulting in 104 participants for CART analyses with neuroimaging data.\n\nThe dataset includes a mix of previously used and novel data. The motor task used in this study has been validated against clinical activities of daily living measures in amnestic MCI patients and has been published previously. The neuropsychological tests and MRI procedures are standard and have been used in various studies within the community. The regression tree analyses and random forest models were carried out using established statistical packages in R, ensuring reproducibility and comparability with other studies.",
  "dataset/splits": "Two separate regression tree models were used to predict motor task ISD. The primary set of models included cognitively unimpaired (CU), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and probable mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects. A second set of models used only CU and MCI subjects.\n\nThe minimum terminal node size was set to seven to optimize the estimated ISD. Thirty cross-validations were performed on each model to determine the optimal complexity parameter, ensuring the most reliable model. The mean squared error (MSE) values for each terminal node were used to estimate overall model fit, with values approaching zero indicating better model fit.\n\nThe distribution of data points in each split was not explicitly detailed, but the models were designed to handle a large number of predictor variables, allowing for an empirical assessment of their predictive power. The regression tree analyses were carried out using R with specific packages to generate and visualize the models.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "Not applicable",
  "dataset/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in this study is decision trees, specifically Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis. This method is not new; it has been employed in various disciplines, including dermatology, cardiology, and oncology. The choice of CART analysis was driven by its intuitive and visually interpretable outputs, which are particularly useful for clinical interpretations. This algorithm is well-suited for handling a large number of independent variables and identifying those that best characterize the outcome of interest.\n\nThe decision to use CART analysis in this context was motivated by its ability to provide straightforward insights into the relationships between predictor variables and the dependent variable. While CART is a established method, its application in studies of aging, neurodegenerative disease, and cognition is less common. This study aims to highlight the utility of CART analysis in these areas, particularly for neuroimaging and cognitive research.\n\nThe random forest algorithm, another popular machine-learning approach in biomedical research, was also considered. However, CART was preferred for its ease of interpretation through graphical representations, which can facilitate a better conceptual understanding of how predictor variables relate to the dependent variable. The random forest algorithm, while powerful, relies more on numeric quantification of variable importance, which may not be as intuitive for clinical interpretations.\n\nThe study did not introduce a novel machine-learning algorithm. Instead, it applied an existing method in a novel context to gain insights into motor learning and its association with gray matter volume measures and neuropsychological test scores. The focus was on leveraging the strengths of CART analysis to provide clear and interpretable results, which can inform future research and clinical practices.",
  "optimization/meta": "The study employed two separate regression tree models to predict motor task ISD, one utilizing volumetric MRI data and the other using neuropsychological variables. These models were constructed using classification and regression tree (CART) analysis, which is a machine learning approach that allows for the empirical assessment of a large number of predictor variables to arrive at a final predictive model. The CART models did not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input; instead, they directly utilized the neuropsychological and volumetric MRI measures.\n\nIn addition to the CART models, random forest regression models were also carried out for comparative purposes. The random forest algorithm is another machine learning approach that utilizes multiple regression or classification trees to arrive at a final set of predictor variables. The random forest models were used to validate the findings from the CART models, and they yielded similar results, indicating that the predictor variables used in both models were congruent.\n\nThe study ensured that the training data for the models was independent. This was achieved by using cross-validation techniques, where the data was split into training and testing sets multiple times to ensure that the models were not overfitting to the training data. Specifically, thirty cross-validations were performed on each model to arrive at an optimal complexity parameter that would represent the most reliable model. This process helped to ensure that the models were generalizable to new data and that the training data was independent.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure the data was suitable for analysis. Initially, age-adjusted intrasubject standard deviation (ISD) values were derived using a generalized linear model with a gamma distribution and a logarithmic link. This transformation was necessary because the raw ISD values were significantly right-skewed. The Spearman correlation was employed to assess the association between neuropsychological variables and age-adjusted ISD, as well as to determine the correlation between age, years of education, and motor task ISD. The Mann-Whitney test was used to examine sex differences in motor task ISD. These preprocessing steps ensured that the data was appropriately scaled and that potential confounding variables were accounted for. The regression tree analyses were then carried out using R with the 'rpart' and 'rattle' packages, and random forest regression models were also conducted for comparative purposes. The resulting models provided insights into the neural and cognitive mechanisms underlying motor task variability.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In the optimization process, a large number of predictor variables were considered. Specifically, all available neuropsychological and volumetric MRI measures were included in their respective models. This approach allowed for an empirical assessment to identify the most relevant predictors. The models were built using an agnostic unsupervised approach, meaning no a priori associations were specified among the variables. This method ensured that the selection of predictor variables was data-driven and based on their ability to optimally split the sample. The final models included a subset of these variables that best predicted the dependent variable, which in this case was age-adjusted motor task intra-subject standard deviation (ISD). The exact number of parameters used in the final models varied, as the regression tree analyses iteratively split the data until no further optimal divisions could be made. This process resulted in terminal nodes containing the final predicted values for the dependent variable.",
  "optimization/features": "In the optimization process, two separate regression tree models were employed to predict motor task intrasubject standard deviation (ISD). The first model utilized volumetric MRI data, while the second model incorporated neuropsychological variables. For both models, an agnostic unsupervised approach was adopted, meaning no prior associations were specified among the variables included in the models.\n\nAll available neuropsychological and volumetric MRI measures were entered into their respective models. This approach allowed for an empirically-based subset of predictor variables to be identified, which could then be used to conceptualize the cognitive and neural mechanisms associated with motor task ISD.\n\nThe regression tree analyses were advantageous as they allowed for the empirical assessment of a large number of predictor variables, specifically 20 or more, to arrive at a final predictive model. This method does not impose any distributional assumptions on the dependent variable, eliminating the need for transformations and allowing the data to be interpreted on its original scale of measurement.\n\nThe feature selection process was integrated into the model-building procedure itself. The regression tree algorithm iteratively evaluates each predictor variable's ability to optimally split the sample, continuing this process until the sample can no longer be optimally divided. This results in a subset of the most relevant features being selected for the final model.\n\nThe minimum terminal node size was set to seven to optimize the estimated ISD, and thirty cross-validations were performed on each model to arrive at an optimal complexity parameter. This ensured that the models were reliable and provided stable estimates of the ISD.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The study employed classification and regression tree (CART) analysis to predict motor task intrasubject standard deviation (ISD) using a large number of predictor variables, specifically volumetric gray matter measures and neuropsychological test scores. This approach is advantageous because it can handle a high number of independent variables, allowing for the empirical assessment of their predictive power without imposing distributional assumptions on the dependent variable.\n\nTo address the potential issue of overfitting, given the large number of parameters relative to the number of training points, several strategies were implemented. First, the minimum terminal node size was set to seven, which helps to ensure that each split in the tree is based on a sufficient number of observations, reducing the risk of overfitting to noise in the data. Second, thirty cross-validations were performed on each model to arrive at an optimal complexity parameter. This process helps to identify the most reliable model by balancing model complexity and generalization performance. Additionally, the mean squared error (MSE) values for each terminal node were used to provide an estimate of overall model fit, with lower MSE values indicating better model performance.\n\nTo mitigate underfitting, an agnostic unsupervised approach was used when building the CART models, where no a priori associations were specified among the variables. This allowed for a comprehensive exploration of the data, ensuring that all available neuropsychological and volumetric MRI measures were considered. Furthermore, the use of regression tree analyses, which do not require transformations of the data, allowed the models to be interpreted on their original scale of measurement, preserving the natural relationships within the data.\n\nThe study also included random forest regression models for comparative purposes, which utilize multiple regression trees to arrive at a final set of predictor variables. The congruence between the CART and random forest models in terms of the predictor variables used further supports the robustness of the findings, indicating that the models are not overly simplistic or complex. Overall, these methods ensured that the models were neither overfitted nor underfitted, providing reliable and interpretable results.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our models. One key method used was cross-validation. Specifically, we performed thirty cross-validations for each model to determine the optimal complexity parameter. This process helped in identifying the most reliable model by evaluating how well the model generalizes to new data.\n\nAdditionally, we set a minimum terminal node size of seven for each regression tree. This constraint helps in preventing the model from becoming too complex and overfitting the training data. By ensuring that each terminal node contains a sufficient number of participants, we aimed to create a more generalizable model.\n\nFurthermore, the use of regression tree analyses inherently provides a form of regularization. These analyses do not impose any distributional assumptions on the dependent variable, allowing the data to be interpreted on its original scale of measurement. This approach helps in avoiding overfitting by focusing on the most significant splits that optimally divide the sample.\n\nIn summary, our study utilized cross-validation, minimum terminal node size constraints, and the inherent properties of regression tree analyses to prevent overfitting and ensure the reliability of our predictive models.",
  "optimization/config": "Not applicable.",
  "model/interpretability": "The models used in this study are not black-box models. Instead, they are designed to be transparent and interpretable. The primary models employed are Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analyses, which are known for their intuitive and visually interpretable outputs. These models provide a clear, step-by-step breakdown of how different predictor variables influence the dependent variable, making it easier to understand the relationships between the variables.\n\nFor instance, the regression tree plots generated from the CART models visually represent the splitting process, showing which independent variables and cutoff values were used at each split. This allows for a straightforward interpretation of how specific neuropsychological tests and volumetric gray matter measures contribute to predicting motor task variability. Each node in the tree represents a subgroup created by a split, and the terminal nodes contain the final predicted values for the dependent variable, along with the number of participants included in each split.\n\nAdditionally, the random forest models, which were used for comparative purposes, provide numeric quantification of variable importance. While these models are somewhat less intuitive than the CART models, they still offer insights into which variables are most influential in predicting the outcome. For example, the random forest model for neuropsychological variables highlighted tests like RBANS List Learning and RBANS Semantic Fluency as having the highest importance values, indicating their significant role in predicting motor task variability.\n\nOverall, the use of CART and random forest models in this study ensures that the results are not only statistically robust but also easily interpretable, providing clear examples of how different cognitive and neural mechanisms are associated with motor task learning.",
  "model/output": "The models employed in this study are regression models, specifically regression tree models. These models were used to predict age-adjusted motor task intra-subject standard deviation (ISD). Two separate regression tree models were utilized: one with volumetric MRI data and another with neuropsychological variables. The primary set of models included cognitively unimpaired (CU), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and probable mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects, while a secondary set focused solely on CU and MCI subjects. The regression trees allowed for the empirical assessment of a large number of predictor variables, enabling the identification of key factors that influence motor task ISD. The models did not impose any distributional assumptions on the dependent variable, allowing for interpretation on the original scale of measurement. Additionally, random forest regression models were conducted for comparative purposes, yielding results that closely paralleled those of the regression tree models. The mean squared error (MSE) values for each terminal node were used to estimate overall model fit, with lower values indicating better performance. The models provided stable estimates of ISD, demonstrating their effectiveness in predicting motor task variability based on both volumetric and neuropsychological measures.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "The source code for the regression tree and random forest analyses is provided as a Supplemental File. This file includes R code with comments, allowing others to replicate the analyses. The code utilizes specific packages in R, such as \u2018rpart\u2019 and \u2018randomForest\u2019, to perform the regression tree and random forest analyses, respectively. The \u2018rattle\u2019 package was also used to generate regression tree plots, although due to image quality issues, the plots were recreated using Microsoft Publisher. The Supplemental File serves as a resource for those interested in understanding or replicating the methods used in this study.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of our method involved several rigorous statistical analyses to ensure the robustness and reliability of our findings. We employed classification and regression tree (CART) analyses to derive constellations of volumetric gray matter and neuropsychological variables that best predicted age-adjusted motor task intra-subject standard deviation (ISD). These regression tree analyses are advantageous because they allow for the empirical assessment of a large number of predictor variables, without imposing any distributional assumptions on the dependent variable. This approach eliminates the need for transformations and allows for the data to be interpreted on its original scale of measurement.\n\nThe empirical assessment employed by regression trees begins with an evaluation of each predictor variable\u2019s ability to optimally split the sample at a particular value. Each split results in two branches with nodes representing the subgroups created by a split. The splitting process is continued iteratively for each node until the sample can no longer be optimally divided by any of the predictor variables. The resulting plot contains nodes and branches that show which independent variables and cutoff values were used at a particular split. Within each node, the number of participants included from the split as well as the predicted value for the dependent variable are also shown.\n\nFor this study, two separate regression tree models were used to predict motor task ISD, one with volumetric MRI data and one with neuropsychological variables. The primary set of CART models included cognitively unimpaired (CU), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and probable mild Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) subjects, while a second set used only CU and MCI subjects. For each regression tree, the minimum terminal node size was set to seven to optimize the estimated ISD. Thirty cross-validations were performed on each model to arrive at an optimal complexity parameter that would represent the most reliable model. The mean squared error (MSE) values for each terminal node were used to provide an estimate of overall model fit. While there is no defined MSE cutoff for interpreting model fit, the general convention is that MSE values approaching zero indicate better model fit.\n\nAdditionally, receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analyses using the raw and age-adjusted ISD values from each of the four models were conducted to determine how well the MCI and probable mild AD cases could be differentiated from the CU cases. Four ROC analyses were carried out: CU vs. MCI+AD; CU vs. MCI, CU vs. AD, and MCI vs. AD. The diagnostic accuracy of the derived area under the curve (AUC) values were interpreted using the following scheme: 0.70 \u2013 0.79 = acceptable, 0.80 \u2013 0.89 = excellent, \u22650.90 = outstanding. These analyses provided further validation of our method's ability to differentiate between different cognitive states.",
  "evaluation/measure": "The performance measures reported in this study focus on the diagnostic accuracy of motor task intrasubject standard deviation (ISD) in differentiating between clinical groups. The primary metric used is the area under the curve (AUC) from receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analyses. These analyses were conducted to assess how well raw and age-adjusted ISD values could distinguish between cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals, those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and those with probable mild Alzheimer's disease (AD).\n\nThe AUC values were interpreted using a standard scheme: 0.70\u20130.79 as acceptable, 0.80\u20130.89 as excellent, and \u22650.90 as outstanding. The ROC analyses were performed for four comparisons: CU vs. MCI+AD, CU vs. MCI, CU vs. AD, and MCI vs. AD. Both raw and age-adjusted ISD values were evaluated.\n\nFor raw ISD values, the AUCs ranged from 0.57 to 0.72, with the CU vs. MCI comparison showing the highest sensitivity at 89%. When age-adjusted ISD values were used, the AUCs ranged from 0.56 to 0.77, with the CU vs. AD comparison yielding the highest diagnostic accuracy at 0.77. These metrics indicate that motor task ISD, particularly when age-adjusted, can provide acceptable diagnostic accuracy in differentiating between CU and AD groups.\n\nAdditionally, sensitivity and specificity were reported for each comparison. Sensitivity refers to the true positive rate, while specificity refers to the true negative rate. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of the diagnostic performance of motor task ISD.\n\nThe use of AUC, sensitivity, and specificity is representative of standard practices in the literature for evaluating diagnostic tests. These metrics allow for a clear assessment of the test's ability to correctly identify individuals with and without the condition of interest. The focus on motor task ISD is novel, as it considers variability across multiple trials rather than average performance, which may offer more sensitive detection of early cognitive decline.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "For the \"Methods Comparison\" subsection, we conducted a comparative analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. We performed random forest regression models alongside our primary regression tree analyses. These random forest models were applied to both neuropsychological and volumetric measures, providing a benchmark for comparison. This allowed us to assess the relative performance and robustness of our regression tree models against an established, alternative method.\n\nAdditionally, we ensured that our models were compared against simpler baselines to understand the added value of our more complex approaches. For instance, we used mean squared error (MSE) values to estimate overall model fit, which helped in comparing the performance of different models. While there is no defined MSE cutoff for interpreting model fit, lower MSE values indicate better model performance, and our approach aimed to minimize these errors through cross-validation and optimal complexity parameters.\n\nWe also performed receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analyses using both raw and age-adjusted ISD values from our models. These analyses helped in determining how well our models could differentiate between clinical groups, such as cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and probable mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). The diagnostic accuracy of the derived area under the curve (AUC) values was interpreted using standard schemes, providing a clear metric for comparison.\n\nIn summary, our methods comparison involved using random forest regression as a benchmark and evaluating simpler baselines through MSE and ROC analyses. This comprehensive approach ensured that our regression tree models were rigorously tested and validated against alternative methods and baselines.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our models included several performance metrics with associated confidence intervals. For instance, the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analyses provided area under the curve (AUC) values with 95% confidence intervals, which are crucial for understanding the diagnostic accuracy of our models. These AUC values were interpreted using a standard scheme: 0.70 \u2013 0.79 as acceptable, 0.80 \u2013 0.89 as excellent, and \u22650.90 as outstanding. This approach ensures that our claims about the models' performance are backed by statistically significant results.\n\nIn addition to AUC values, we also reported sensitivity and specificity with their respective 95% confidence intervals for different clinical status comparisons. This detailed reporting allows for a comprehensive assessment of the models' performance across various metrics.\n\nStatistical significance was a key consideration in our analyses. For example, we used the Mann-Whitney test to assess sex differences in motor task ISD and found no significant differences. Similarly, Spearman correlation was used to evaluate the association between neuropsychological variables and age-adjusted ISD, with all significant correlations ranging from \u22120.41 to 0.24. These statistical tests provide a robust foundation for claiming the superiority of our methods over baselines.\n\nFurthermore, the regression tree models were validated using cross-validation techniques. We performed 30 cross-validations on each model to determine the optimal complexity parameter, ensuring that the models were reliable and generalizable. The mean squared error (MSE) values for each terminal node were used to estimate overall model fit, with values approaching zero indicating better model performance.\n\nThe congruence between the CART and random forest models further supports the reliability of our findings. Both models identified similar predictor variables, such as the supramarginal gyrus and hippocampus for volumetric measures, and RBANS List Learning and Semantic Fluency for neuropsychological variables. This consistency across different modeling approaches strengthens our confidence in the results.\n\nOverall, the inclusion of confidence intervals, statistically significant results, and rigorous validation techniques ensures that our claims about the models' performance are well-supported and reliable.",
