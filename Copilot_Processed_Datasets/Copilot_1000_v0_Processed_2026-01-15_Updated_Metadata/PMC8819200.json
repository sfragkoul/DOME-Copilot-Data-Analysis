  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study consists of ECG signals collected from 37 depression patients and 37 healthy subjects. All participants were free from heart disease, hypertension, and cerebral infarction. The depression patients were inpatients recruited from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Jining Medical College in Shandong, China. The healthy subjects were recruited from Shandong University and had no history of mental disorders or drug abuse. Data collection was conducted in a controlled environment, free from noise and electromagnetic interference, with subjects lying flat and relaxed. Each subject's ECG signal was recorded for 5.5 minutes using a multifunctional physiology experiment instrument with a sampling rate of 1 kHz. The signals were preprocessed to remove noise and standardized for consistency. This dataset is unique to this study and has not been used in previous papers or by the community. The inter-patient data classification standard was employed, where the training and test sets come from different patient data, aligning with actual clinical environments.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset used in this study consists of ECG signals from 37 depression patients and 37 healthy controls. The data was split into training and test sets using an inter-patient data classification standard, ensuring that the training and test sets come from different individuals. This approach helps in evaluating the model's performance in a more realistic clinical environment.\n\nFor the experiments, 29 individuals were randomly selected to form the training set, while the remaining 8 individuals constituted the test set. This process was repeated 10 times with different random selections to ensure robustness. The average of these 10 experiments was used as the final evaluation result.\n\nThe ECG signals were segmented into different durations: 3 seconds, 4 seconds, 5 seconds, and 6 seconds. For example, when using 5-second segments, the training set contained 4000 ECG segments, and the test set contained 1060 ECG segments. The number of segments from depression patients and healthy controls was equal in both sets. This segmentation approach ensures that the model can handle varying lengths of ECG data, which is crucial for real-time clinical applications.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets used in this study were split using an inter-patient data classification standard, which is more aligned with real-world clinical environments. This approach ensures that the training and test sets are independent, coming from different patients. This method was enforced by randomly selecting 29 individuals for the training set and the remaining 8 for the test set. This process was repeated 10 times with different random selections, and the average of these 10 experiments was used as the final evaluation result.\n\nThe distribution of the datasets in this study is notable for its focus on ensuring that the training and test sets are entirely independent. This is a departure from some previously published machine learning datasets, which often use intra-patient splits where both training and test data come from the same patients. By using inter-patient splits, the study aims to better simulate the real-world scenario where a model trained on known patient data is tested on new, unseen patient data. This approach helps to ensure that the model's performance is more generalizable and robust.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in our study is Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, we employed a one-dimensional CNN tailored for processing ECG signals. This choice was driven by the need to handle the unique dimensionality of ECG data, which differs from image data typically processed by two-dimensional CNNs.\n\nThe CNN architecture we developed is not entirely novel but is adapted for the specific task of depression recognition using ECG signals. It consists of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, with rectified linear units (ReLU) as the activation function. The network is designed to automatically learn features from ECG segments, avoiding the need for manual feature extraction.\n\nThe decision to use a CNN in this context is rooted in its effectiveness in feature extraction and classification tasks, particularly when dealing with sequential data like ECG signals. The use of a one-dimensional convolution kernel of size 16 was found to be more effective for our purposes compared to smaller kernels commonly used in other studies. This larger kernel size allows the network to better capture the overall changes in the ECG signals associated with depression, a persistent state rather than a single heartbeat event.\n\nThe reason this algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that the focus of our work is on the application of machine learning to the specific problem of depression recognition using ECG signals. The innovation lies in the adaptation of the CNN architecture to this particular medical application, rather than in the development of a new machine-learning algorithm per se. Our contributions are more aligned with the interdisciplinary field of biomedical engineering and clinical research, where the practical application and validation of existing machine-learning techniques are of primary importance.",
  "optimization/meta": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, the data encoding and preprocessing steps were crucial for ensuring the quality and consistency of the ECG signals used for depression recognition. The raw ECG signals were initially collected using a multifunctional physiology experiment instrument with a sampling rate of 1 kHz. These signals often contained various types of noise, including electromyogram (EMG) interference, power frequency interference, and baseline drift. To address these issues, we employed a series of filtering techniques.\n\nFirst, a Butterworth low-pass filter was applied to remove high-frequency noise above 80 Hz. This step was essential for eliminating EMG interference, which can significantly affect the quality of the ECG signals. Next, a notch filter was used to remove 50 Hz power frequency interference, a common issue in electrical recordings. Finally, a median filter with a window size of 109 was utilized to eliminate baseline drift, ensuring a stable signal baseline.\n\nTo further standardize the ECG signals, we resampled all signals to a common sampling rate of 360 Hz. This step was important for maintaining consistency across different recordings. Additionally, we applied z-score standardization to normalize the amplitude of the ECG signals, which helped in reducing variability and improving the performance of the machine-learning algorithm.\n\nAfter filtering and standardization, we deleted 50 sampling points before and after the ECG signals to eliminate any influence of time delay introduced during the filtering process. This preprocessing step ensured that the signals were clean and ready for segmentation and classification.\n\nThe preprocessed ECG signals were then divided into segments of varying durations (3 s, 4 s, 5 s, and 6 s) for further analysis. These segments were used as input for our one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN), which was designed to automatically learn and extract features from the ECG data. The use of preprocessed signals as direct input to the CNN allowed us to avoid the complexities of manual feature extraction, thereby enhancing the robustness and accuracy of our depression recognition model.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we employed a one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to analyze ECG segments for depression recognition. The model architecture consists of two convolutional layers, two max-pooling layers, and one fully connected layer. The specific parameters of the model are detailed in a summary table, which outlines the output shape and kernel size for each layer.\n\nThe selection of the model parameters was guided by the need to balance computational efficiency and classification performance. We conducted experiments with different numbers of convolutional layers, ranging from 5 to 13 layers. The results indicated that while increasing the number of layers slightly improved accuracy, it significantly increased training time. For instance, the 11-layer CNN model achieved the highest accuracy of 94.91%, but it took 7285.258 seconds to train, which is 22.8 times longer than the 5-layer CNN model. Considering the trade-off between performance and computational cost, we recommend the 5-layer CNN model for related applications. This model achieved an accuracy of 93.96%, sensitivity of 89.43%, specificity of 98.49%, and positive productivity of 98.34%, making it a practical choice for real-time depression recognition using ECG signals.\n\nThe convolutional layers use a kernel size of 16, which was chosen based on experimental comparisons. This size was found to be more effective for capturing the overall changes in ECG signals associated with depression, as opposed to smaller kernel sizes commonly used in heart disease classification. The activation function for the convolutional layers is the rectified linear unit (ReLU), and the fully connected layer uses the Softmax function to output the classification results. The model was trained using the cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer, with a learning rate of 0.01 and 100 epochs.",
  "optimization/features": "Not applicable. The method described does not involve manual feature extraction or selection. Instead, it uses raw ECG signals as input for a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN automatically learns and extracts relevant features from the ECG segments, eliminating the need for manual feature selection. This approach allows the model to utilize more comprehensive information directly from the ECG data.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study utilized a 5-layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to analyze 5-second ECG segments. The model's architecture was chosen to balance computational efficiency and performance, as evidenced by its high accuracy and relatively short training time compared to deeper networks.\n\nThe number of parameters in the 5-layer CNN is substantial, but it is not excessively large relative to the number of training points. The training set consisted of 4000 ECG segments, which provided a sufficient number of data points to train the model effectively. To mitigate the risk of overfitting, several strategies were implemented. First, the model's convergence speed was fast, with the accuracy rate reaching 95% at the 8th epoch and the loss value dropping below 0.01 after the 81st epoch, indicating stable learning. Additionally, the use of an inter-patient data classification standard, where the training and test sets came from different patients, helped to ensure that the model generalized well to unseen data. This approach is more aligned with real-world clinical environments, reducing the likelihood of overfitting to specific patient characteristics.\n\nTo address underfitting, the model's performance was evaluated using multiple metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and positive productivity. The 5-layer CNN achieved high scores in all these metrics, particularly with a sensitivity of 89.43% and a specificity of 98.49%, demonstrating that the model was capable of capturing the necessary patterns in the data without being too simplistic. Furthermore, the comparison with other network architectures showed that increasing the number of layers beyond 5 did not significantly improve performance but did increase training time substantially. This indicates that the 5-layer CNN strikes an optimal balance, avoiding both overfitting and underfitting.",
  "optimization/regularization": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is a one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is inherently a black-box model. This means that while the CNN can effectively learn and classify features from ECG signals, the internal decision-making process is not easily interpretable. The CNN automatically extracts features from the raw ECG data through its convolutional and pooling layers, but the specific features it focuses on are not explicitly defined or easily understood.\n\nThe use of larger convolution kernels in the CNN allows it to better capture overall changes in the ECG signals, which is beneficial for identifying depression. However, this also contributes to the model's black-box nature, as the exact patterns or features that the larger kernels are detecting are not transparent.\n\nThe model's architecture includes convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and a fully connected layer with activation functions. The convolutional layers use rectified linear units (ReLU) as the activation function, and the fully connected layer uses the Softmax function to output the classification results. The cross-entropy function is used as the loss function during training, and the Adam optimizer is employed to update the model's weights.\n\nWhile the model achieves high diagnostic performance with an accuracy of 93.96%, sensitivity of 89.43%, specificity of 98.49%, and positive productivity of 98.34%, the lack of interpretability is a limitation. The model's decisions are based on complex interactions between its layers and weights, making it difficult to provide clear examples of how it arrives at its classifications. This black-box nature is a common characteristic of deep learning models, including CNNs.",
  "model/output": "The model is a classification model. It is designed to distinguish between depression patients and normal controls using ECG signals. The output of the model is a classification into one of two categories: normal or depression. This is achieved through a fully-connected layer with a Softmax activation function, which provides the probability distributions for the two classes. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and positive productivity, which are typical for classification tasks. The ultimate goal is to identify depression from ECG signals, making it a classification problem rather than a regression problem.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time of the model varied depending on the number of convolutional layers used. For a five-layer CNN model, the training time was significantly shorter compared to an 11-layer CNN model. Specifically, the 11-layer CNN, while achieving a slightly higher accuracy of 94.94%, took 22.8 times longer to train than the five-layer CNN. This increase in training time did not correspond to a significant improvement in classification performance, making the five-layer CNN more recommended for related applications due to its balance of accuracy and computational efficiency. The model's convergence was notably fast, with the accuracy rate reaching 95% at the 8th epoch and the loss value dropping below 0.01 after the 81st epoch, remaining stable thereafter.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the proposed method involved a rigorous process designed to ensure its effectiveness and reliability. The study utilized an inter-patient data classification standard, which is more aligned with real-world clinical scenarios. This approach involved dividing the dataset such that the training and test sets came from different patients, ensuring that the model's performance could be generalized to new, unseen data.\n\nThe evaluation process included experiments with ECG segments of varying durations: 3 seconds, 4 seconds, 5 seconds, and 6 seconds. This was done to determine the optimal segment length for accurate depression recognition. The 5-second ECG segment was found to provide the best balance between classification performance and practicality, achieving an accuracy of 93.96%, sensitivity of 89.43%, specificity of 98.49%, and positive productivity of 98.34%.\n\nTo ensure the robustness of the results, 10 independent experiments were conducted. In each experiment, 29 subjects were randomly selected for the training set, and the remaining 8 subjects were used for the test set. The average of these 10 test results was taken as the final evaluation metric. This method helped to mitigate the variability that could arise from a single experiment and provided a more reliable assessment of the model's performance.\n\nAdditionally, the study compared the performance of different CNN architectures with varying numbers of convolutional layers. This comparison revealed that while deeper networks could achieve slightly higher accuracy, they also required significantly more training time. The 5-layer CNN was chosen as the optimal architecture due to its balance between performance and efficiency, making it suitable for real-time applications.\n\nThe evaluation metrics used included accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and positive productivity. These metrics were calculated based on the confusion matrix, which provided a detailed breakdown of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. This comprehensive evaluation approach ensured that the method's performance was thoroughly assessed and validated.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed a comprehensive set of performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of our depression recognition method using ECG signals. The primary metrics we reported include accuracy, positive productivity, sensitivity, and specificity. These metrics are widely recognized and used in the literature for evaluating classification models, ensuring that our results are comparable with other studies in the field.\n\nAccuracy measures the proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined. It provides a general indication of the model's performance. Positive productivity, also known as precision, focuses on the proportion of true positive results among all positive results predicted by the model. This metric is crucial for understanding the reliability of positive predictions.\n\nSensitivity, or recall, assesses the proportion of actual positive cases that are correctly identified by the model. It is particularly important in medical diagnostics where missing a positive case can have serious consequences. Specificity, on the other hand, measures the proportion of true negative results among all actual negative cases. High specificity indicates that the model is effective in correctly identifying negative cases, which is essential for reducing false alarms.\n\nThese metrics collectively provide a robust evaluation of our model's performance. Accuracy gives an overall sense of the model's effectiveness, while sensitivity and specificity offer insights into its performance in identifying positive and negative cases, respectively. Positive productivity ensures that the positive predictions made by the model are reliable. This set of metrics is representative of the standards used in the literature, allowing for meaningful comparisons with other studies in the field of depression recognition using ECG signals.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our evaluation, we conducted a thorough comparison of our proposed method with existing approaches in the field of ECG-based depression recognition. We did not use publicly available benchmark datasets, but we compared our method with recent studies that also focused on depression recognition using ECG signals.\n\nOur method was compared with several existing approaches, as detailed in Table 5. These comparisons included various studies that used different features and classifiers, such as logistic regression, Bayesian networks, support vector machines (SVM), and neuro-fuzzy networks. The performance metrics used for comparison included accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and positive productivity.\n\nWe found that our proposed method, which uses a 5-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) with 5-second ECG segments, achieved the highest accuracy of 93.96%. This performance surpassed other methods that relied on manually extracted features from heart rate variability (HRV) sequences. For instance, Kuang et al. achieved an accuracy of 86.4%, while Xing et al. reported an accuracy of 89.66%. Our method also demonstrated superior sensitivity and specificity, indicating its effectiveness in reducing false positives and accurately identifying depression cases.\n\nAdditionally, we compared different network architectures to analyze the influence of network depth on classification results. Table 4 shows the performance of CNN models with varying numbers of convolutional layers. While an 11-layer CNN achieved the highest accuracy of 94.91%, the 5-layer CNN was recommended for practical applications due to its balanced performance and shorter training time. This comparison highlights the trade-off between model complexity and computational efficiency.\n\nIn summary, our evaluation included a detailed comparison with existing methods and simpler baselines, demonstrating the superiority of our proposed approach in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. This comprehensive analysis underscores the potential of our method as a reliable tool for depression recognition using ECG signals.",
