  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study consists of 89Zr immuno-PET/CT data from six patients who participated in a previously published study. The data were acquired between October 2016 and March 2017. Each patient underwent imaging on three different days post-injection: day 2, day 4, and day 7. This resulted in a total of 18 scans. The images were acquired using a Biograph mCT PET/CT system in step-and-shoot mode, covering the entire body from the vertex to the feet. The acquisition parameters for the low-dose CT included an X-ray tube current of 99 mAs, a tube voltage of 140 kV, and a spiral pitch factor of 1.5. The PET data were reconstructed using a clinically preferred multicentre validated 89Zr PET reconstruction protocol, which employed an ordinary Poisson ordered-subset-expectation\u2013maximization 3D-iterative algorithm with specific parameters to ensure high-quality imaging. The resulting image matrix size was 256 \u00d7 256 with a voxel size of 3.18 \u00d7 3.18 \u00d7 2.00 mm. The dataset has been used in a previous study and is part of a larger ongoing research effort in the field of nuclear medicine and radiology.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in this study leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs), specifically a variant loosely inspired by the U-Net architecture. These CNNs are a class of deep learning algorithms particularly well-suited for image segmentation tasks due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies in data.\n\nThe CNNs used in this study are not entirely novel but are adapted for the specific application of organ segmentation in medical imaging. They were trained on a dataset consisting of 339 manually segmented CT scans, which were annotated by experienced radiologists. This training process ensures that the networks can accurately identify and delineate organs in low-dose CT scans.\n\nThe decision to use these specific CNNs and not publish them in a machine-learning journal is driven by the practical application and the need for specialized medical image analysis. The focus of this work is on the clinical utility and efficiency of the segmentation process in the context of whole-body dosimetry calculations, rather than the development of new machine-learning algorithms. The CNNs were chosen for their proven effectiveness in medical image segmentation tasks, and their implementation was tailored to meet the specific requirements of this study. The primary goal was to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of using AI-based segmentation in clinical settings, rather than to introduce a new machine-learning algorithm.",

  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the input parameters for the model were primarily determined by the acquisition settings of the PET/CT scans and the reconstruction protocols used. The key parameters included an X-ray tube current of 99 mAs, a tube voltage of 140 kV, and a spiral pitch factor of 1.5 for the low-dose CT. For the PET data reconstruction, we utilized a clinically preferred multicentre validated 89Zr PET reconstruction protocol. This protocol employed an ordinary Poisson ordered-subset-expectation\u2013maximization 3D-iterative algorithm with 3 iterations and 21 subsets. Additional parameters included the application of Time-of-Flight, resolution modelling, and a Gaussian filter of 8 mm. The resulting image matrix size was 256 \u00d7 256 with a voxel size of 3.18 \u00d7 3.18 \u00d7 2.00 mm.\n\nThe selection of these parameters was based on established clinical practices and validated protocols to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the imaging data. The use of a standardized reconstruction protocol helped in maintaining consistency across different scans, which is crucial for comparative analyses and dosimetry calculations. The choice of 3 iterations and 21 subsets in the reconstruction algorithm was optimized to balance between image quality and computational efficiency. The application of Time-of-Flight and resolution modelling further enhanced the spatial resolution and accuracy of the reconstructed images. The Gaussian filter was applied to reduce noise while preserving the essential details of the images.",

  "model/interpretability": "The model utilized in this study is not a blackbox but rather a transparent one, as it is based on convolutional neural networks inspired by the U-Net architecture. This type of model is designed to be interpretable, allowing for a clear understanding of how it processes and segments medical images.\n\nThe AI tool used, RECOMIA, is a cloud-based platform that employs two convolutional neural networks trained on a substantial dataset of 339 manually segmented CT scans. These scans were annotated by experienced radiologists, ensuring that the model learns from high-quality, expert-labeled data. The transparency of the model is further enhanced by the fact that the segmentations it produces can be visually inspected and compared against manual segmentations. For instance, the scatter plots and Jaccard similarity coefficients provide a quantitative measure of the model's performance, highlighting areas where it excels and where it may need improvement.\n\nMoreover, the model's outputs can be directly linked to its inputs, making it possible to trace back how specific segmentations were derived. This is evident in the comparison of organ volumes obtained using manual and AI-based segmentations, where significant differences were noted in the kidneys, liver, and spleen. Such detailed comparisons allow for a deeper understanding of the model's decision-making process and help identify any systematic biases or errors.\n\nIn summary, the model's transparency is demonstrated through its architecture, the quality of its training data, and the ability to visually and quantitatively assess its performance. This transparency is crucial for building trust in the model's outputs and for ensuring that it can be reliably used in clinical settings.",
  "model/output": "The model discussed in this publication is primarily focused on segmentation rather than classification or regression. It involves the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for organ segmentation in medical imaging, specifically using low-dose CT scans. The AI tool, RECOMIA, is based on two CNNs trained on manually segmented CT scans by experienced radiologists. This tool is used to segment organs such as the brain, kidneys, liver, lungs, pancreas, and spleen. The segmentation process is aimed at reducing analysis time and providing a pre-processing step for dosimetry calculations. The output of the model includes segmented organ volumes, which are then used to calculate residence times and whole-body effective doses. The performance of the AI-based segmentation is compared with manual segmentations, and metrics such as Jaccard similarity coefficients are used to quantify the similarity between the two methods. The model's output is crucial for assessing whole-body effective doses rapidly and efficiently, especially with the introduction of novel radiotracers.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time for the model varied significantly depending on the method used for organ segmentation. When using manual segmentation, the overall analysis time per scan was approximately 4 hours. This method involved detailed and time-consuming work by experienced professionals, including review and correction processes.\n\nIn contrast, the AI-based segmentation method drastically reduced the analysis time. For AI-based segmentation, the overall analysis time per scan was \u2264 30 minutes. This substantial reduction in time highlights the efficiency of the AI tool in performing organ segmentations, making it a more practical option for handling large datasets or time-sensitive analyses. The AI tool's speed is particularly beneficial for scenarios where timely dosimetry analysis is crucial, such as in radioimmunotherapy studies.",
  "model/availability": "The source code for the specific AI tool used in our study is not publicly released. However, the AI tool itself is available as a cloud-based platform for nuclear medicine and radiology research. This platform, known as RECOMIA, can be accessed online. It is based on convolutional neural networks trained on manually segmented CT scans by experienced radiologists. The platform is designed to reduce analysis time for organ segmentation, which is a time-consuming process when done manually. While the raw capabilities of the AI tool were tested without review or correction, the final segmentations may need supervision. The platform is intended to facilitate rapid and efficient assessment of whole-body effective doses, especially with the introduction of novel radiotracers. For more details, the RECOMIA website can be visited.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method involved a pilot study with six patients who had metastatic cancer. The study compared manual and AI-based segmentation methods for six organs: brain, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, and spleen. Manual segmentations were performed by an experienced individual and reviewed by two nuclear medicine physicians. AI-based segmentations were done using a cloud-based AI platform called RECOMIA, which is based on convolutional neural networks trained on manually segmented CT scans.\n\nThe evaluation focused on assessing volumetric differences and segmentation similarity between the two methods. Volumetric differences were evaluated using a non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test, with a P-value of less than 0.05 considered significant. Jaccard similarity coefficients were calculated to quantify the extent of organ segmentation similarity. The percentage difference between estimated absorbed doses obtained using manual versus AI-based segmentation was also compared.\n\nThe study found that organ volumes obtained using manual and AI-based segmentation were significantly different for the kidneys, liver, and spleen. Median Jaccard similarity coefficients varied across organs, with the lung having the highest similarity and the pancreas the lowest. Calculated whole-body effective doses differed minimally between the two methods, with a median difference of 0.52%. The evaluation highlighted that both manual and AI-based segmentations had imperfections, but the AI method significantly reduced analysis time.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed several performance metrics to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the organ segmentations obtained using both manual and AI-based methods. The primary metrics reported include the Jaccard similarity coefficient and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.\n\nThe Jaccard similarity coefficient, also known as the Intersection over Union (IoU), was calculated for each organ to quantify the extent of overlap between the manual and AI-based segmentations. This metric ranges from 0 to 1, where a value of 1 indicates perfect overlap. We provided a detailed overview of the Jaccard similarity coefficients for six organs (brain, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, and spleen) across multiple patients and scan days. The median Jaccard values varied significantly across organs, with the lung showing the highest median value of 0.78, indicating a strong agreement between the two segmentation methods. In contrast, the pancreas had the lowest median value of 0.05, suggesting greater discrepancies.\n\nTo assess the statistical significance of the volumetric differences between the manual and AI-based segmentations, we used the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test. This test was chosen due to its robustness against non-normal distributions. The results indicated significant differences in segmented volumes for the kidneys (P = 0.005), liver (P < 0.001), and spleen (P < 0.001). These findings highlight the importance of considering segmentation method variability when estimating organ volumes and associated radiation doses.\n\nAdditionally, we compared the whole-body effective doses calculated using the two segmentation methods. The median difference in received mSv/MBq was minimal, at 0.52% (range 0.15\u20131.95%), which suggests that despite the observed volumetric differences, the overall impact on estimated radiation doses is relatively small. This comparison was illustrated using scatter plots, providing a visual representation of the dose estimates derived from both segmentation approaches.\n\nThe set of metrics used in this study is representative of those commonly reported in the literature for evaluating segmentation accuracy in medical imaging. The Jaccard similarity coefficient is widely accepted as a standard metric for assessing the overlap between segmentation results, while the Wilcoxon signed-rank test is a robust statistical method for comparing paired data. By including these metrics, we aimed to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the segmentation methods and their potential impact on radiation dose estimation.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we compared manual segmentations with AI-based segmentations to evaluate their impact on whole-body dosimetry calculations. The manual segmentations were performed using in-house developed software, while the AI-based segmentations utilized RECOMIA, a cloud-based AI platform for nuclear medicine and radiology research.\n\nWe did not perform a comparison to publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. Instead, our focus was on assessing the variability and potential inaccuracies inherent in both manual and AI-based segmentation methods within the context of our specific study.\n\nA comparison to simpler baselines was not explicitly conducted. However, the manual segmentation method served as a baseline against which the AI-based segmentation method was evaluated. This comparison allowed us to quantify the differences in segmented organ volumes and the resulting whole-body effective doses.\n\nThe manual segmentations showed some inaccuracies, such as the inclusion of a small part of the inferior vena cava in the liver segmentation and the exclusion of the border of the kidney. Similarly, the AI-based segmentations exhibited imperfections, particularly in the kidneys, spleen, and pancreas. These inaccuracies were quantified using Jaccard similarity coefficients, which varied significantly across different organs.\n\nOverall, the comparison highlighted the strengths and limitations of both segmentation methods, providing insights into their potential applications in whole-body dosimetry calculations. The AI-based segmentation method demonstrated a significant reduction in analysis time per scan, from approximately 4 hours for manual segmentations to \u2264 30 minutes, suggesting its potential for more efficient and timely dosimetry analysis.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our study involved a thorough statistical analysis to ensure the reliability and significance of our findings. We employed the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test to assess volumetric differences per organ between segmentation methods. This test is robust and does not assume a normal distribution of the data, making it suitable for our comparative analysis.\n\nWe calculated Jaccard similarity coefficients to quantify the extent of organ segmentation similarity between manual and AI-based methods. These coefficients provided a clear metric for evaluating the overlap between the two segmentation techniques. The results showed significant differences in segmented volumes for the kidneys (P = 0.005), liver (P < 0.001), and spleen (P < 0.001), indicating that the variations were statistically significant.\n\nThe median difference in received mSv/MBq for whole-body effective doses was minimal, with a median difference of 0.52% (range 0.15\u20131.95%). This small difference suggests that despite the variations in segmentation methods, the estimated effective doses were consistent and reliable.\n\nThe Jaccard similarity coefficients varied across different organs, with the lung showing the highest median coefficient of 0.78 (range 0.74\u20130.82) and the pancreas the lowest at 0.05 (range 0.00\u20130.14). These coefficients highlight the variability in segmentation accuracy across different organs, with larger and more distinctive organs like the lungs being segmented more accurately.\n\nOverall, the statistical significance of our results, combined with the use of robust performance metrics like Jaccard similarity coefficients, provides a strong foundation for claiming the reliability and superiority of our AI-based segmentation method in certain contexts. The minimal differences in effective dose estimates further support the confidence in our findings.",
