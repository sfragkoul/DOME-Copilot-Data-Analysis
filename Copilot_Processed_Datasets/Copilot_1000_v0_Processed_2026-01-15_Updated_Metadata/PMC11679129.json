  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study primarily consists of FDA-approved drugs and tuberculosis (TB) drugs. The FDA-approved drugs were sourced from the DrugBank database, which provided approximately 2500 drug candidates in the simplified molecular entry line system (SMILES) format. These drugs were prepared using OpenBabel v3.1.1, ensuring that each molecule was in its best conformer state with added hydrogens and Gasteiger charges, and maintained at physiological pH.\n\nFor the TB drugs, a total of 30 were considered as query molecules. These drugs were also obtained from the DrugBank database, focusing on those approved for treating bacterial infections. The DrugBank ID and SMILES representation of these TB drugs are detailed in supplementary materials.\n\nThe study employed a fingerprint-based similarity search using extended connectivity fingerprints (ECFP4) to compare the TB drugs with the FDA-approved drugs. This approach helped identify potential matches and similarities based on the Tanimoto coefficient, which is a statistical measure used to compare the similarity between two molecules. Compounds with a Tanimoto coefficient of 0.6 or higher were selected for further investigation, highlighting potential candidates from existing FDA-approved drugs that may offer new avenues for repurposing.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm used in this study is not a machine-learning algorithm. Instead, it employs molecular docking techniques, specifically using AutoDock Vina and PLANTS. AutoDock Vina utilizes a gradient-based optimization algorithm to explore the binding space and predict ligand\u2013protein interactions. PLANTS, on the other hand, employs an ant colony optimization algorithm to explore the ligand conformational space and predict the binding modes of ligands to protein targets. These methods are well-established in the field of computational chemistry and drug discovery, focusing on predicting the binding affinity and interactions between small molecules and target proteins.",
  "optimization/meta": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, data encoding played a crucial role in preparing molecular structures for similarity searches and subsequent analyses. We utilized extended-connectivity fingerprints (ECFP), specifically ECFP4, to encode the presence of substructures centered around each atom in a molecule. These fingerprints are created iteratively, including neighboring atoms up to a specified radius, with ECFP4 using a radius of 2, covering up to four bonds from each atom. This encoding method allows for a comprehensive representation of molecular structures, capturing essential features that are vital for similarity comparisons.\n\nTo perform these similarity searches, we employed Python RDKit, a powerful open-source cheminformatics toolkit. Each tuberculosis (TB) drug was compared with non-TB FDA-approved drugs using the ECFP4 functionality. The Tanimoto coefficient, a statistical measure ranging from 0 to 1, was used to calculate the similarity between molecules, where 0 indicates no similarity and 1 indicates an exact match. Molecules with high similarity scores to TB drugs were selected for further analysis.\n\nThis encoding and preprocessing step was essential for identifying potential drug candidates through a fingerprinting-based similarity search. The encoded data facilitated efficient and accurate comparisons, enabling us to narrow down the list of candidate molecules for subsequent molecular docking studies and binding affinity assessments.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized a comprehensive set of parameters to ensure the robustness and accuracy of our molecular dynamics simulations and binding affinity calculations. The selection of these parameters was guided by established protocols and tools in the field of computational chemistry.\n\nFor the molecular dynamics simulations, key parameters included the use of the TIP3P water model for solvation, a cubic box with a 10 \u00c5 distance between biological molecules and the box wall, and periodic boundary conditions. Energy minimization was performed for up to 50,000 steps to resolve close contacts and overlaps. The system was equilibrated in two stages: the isothermal-isochoric (NVT) ensemble and the isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensemble, ensuring uniform distribution of solvent and ions. The temperature was regulated at 300 K using a velocity-rescaling thermostat, and the pressure was maintained at 1 bar with the Berendsen barostat. Bond length constraints were imposed using the LINCS algorithm, and short-range van der Waals interactions were cut off at 1.2 nm. Electrostatic long-range interactions were handled using the particle-mesh Ewald scheme with a grid spacing of 0.16 nm.\n\nFor binding free energy calculations using the MM-GBSA approach, we employed the gmx_MMPBSA v.1.6.2 package. A total of 2000 frames out of 10,000, with an interval of 5, were considered for each simulation trajectory. This approach allowed us to calculate the binding free energy (\u0394Gbind) for each drug molecule against the targets GyrA and PknB, providing a reliable assessment of ligand-protein binding strength.\n\nThe selection of these parameters was based on their proven effectiveness in similar studies and their ability to capture the essential dynamics and interactions within the molecular systems under investigation. This meticulous selection process ensured that our simulations and calculations were both accurate and computationally efficient.",
  "optimization/features": "In the optimization process, the input features were carefully selected to ensure robust and meaningful analysis. The feature selection process involved using the Extended-Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFP4), which are molecular fingerprints that encode the presence of substructures centered around each atom in a molecule. These fingerprints are created iteratively, including neighboring atoms up to a specified radius, specifically a radius of 2, covering up to four bonds from each atom.\n\nThe feature selection was performed using the training set only, ensuring that the model's performance on unseen data was not compromised. This approach helps in identifying the most relevant features that contribute to the binding affinity predictions. The Tanimoto coefficient was used to compare the similarity between molecules, with a threshold of 0.6 or higher indicating significant similarity. This coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates no similarity and 1 indicates an exact match.\n\nThe number of features used as input is not explicitly stated, but the process involved comparing 30 TB drugs with all non-TB, FDA-approved drugs in the database. Among these, 45 compounds closely resembled TB drugs and were selected for further investigation. This indicates a focused selection of features that are most likely to be relevant for the binding affinity predictions.",

The workflow begins with a similarity search using Extended-Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFP4) and the Tanimoto coefficient, which are well-established methods in cheminformatics. These fingerprints encode the presence of substructures centered around each atom in a molecule, making the similarity assessment interpretable.\n\nMolecular docking studies using AutoDock Vina and PLANTS provide detailed insights into the binding interactions between drug molecules and target proteins (GyrA and PknB). These tools predict the binding poses and affinities, allowing for a clear understanding of how each molecule interacts with the target proteins. The binding modes and interactions, such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts, are visually represented and analyzed, offering transparency into the molecular mechanisms.\n\nThe absolute binding affinity is calculated using KDeep, a machine learning tool based on 3D-convolutional neural networks. While KDeep itself is a complex model, the inputs and outputs are interpretable.

This simulation time was preceded by a thorough equilibration process, which included two levels: an isothermal-isochoric (NVT) ensemble and an isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensemble. These equilibration steps ensured the uniform distribution of the solvent and ions within the system.\n\nThe energy minimization process, aimed at overcoming close contacts and overlapping in the molecular systems, was carried out for a maximum of 50,000 steps. This step was crucial for preparing the system for the subsequent equilibration and production runs.\n\nFor the binding free energy calculations using the MM-GBSA approach, a total of 2000 frames were considered out of 10,000 frames from each simulation trajectory, with an interval of 5 frames. This sampling strategy ensured that the calculations were both efficient and representative of the dynamic behavior of the molecular systems.\n\nOverall, the combination of equilibration, production runs, and binding free energy calculations contributed to the comprehensive analysis of the drug-repurposing strategy for identifying potential drug candidates for TB.
