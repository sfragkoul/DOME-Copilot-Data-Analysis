  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our study leverages machine learning techniques to analyze and interpret complex cellular morphological data. Specifically, we utilized dimensionality reduction methods, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and linear predictive models, to process the high-dimensional data generated from the Cell Painting assay. These methods are well-established in the field of machine learning and are commonly used for feature extraction and pattern recognition in biological data.\n\nThe algorithms used are not new but are applied in a novel context within our study. The choice of these algorithms was driven by their effectiveness in handling large datasets and their ability to identify subtle patterns that might not be apparent through traditional analytical methods. The integration of these machine learning techniques with our biological assays allowed us to identify potential drug targets for intestinal fibrosis more efficiently.\n\nThe focus of our publication is on the biological and medical implications of our findings rather than the development of new machine learning algorithms. Therefore, while the algorithms themselves are not novel, their application in this specific context\u2014combining image-based profiling with chemogenomic screening\u2014represents a significant advancement in the field of drug discovery. This approach highlights the potential of machine learning to enhance the understanding of disease mechanisms and to accelerate the development of new therapeutic strategies.",
  "optimization/meta": "The meta-predictor leverages data from multiple machine-learning algorithms to enhance predictive accuracy. Specifically, it integrates outputs from both supervised Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and linear predictive models applied to the Cell Painting dataset. These methods help determine the similarities between compounds and controls by analyzing projection scores.\n\nThe supervised PCA method reduces the dimensionality of the data while preserving the variance, making it easier to visualize and interpret the relationships between different compounds and controls. The linear predictive models, on the other hand, provide a more straightforward approach to predicting outcomes based on linear relationships within the data.\n\nThe meta-predictor combines these diverse approaches to create a robust framework for hit picking in the CXCL10 reduction assay and the Cell Painting assay. By using projection scores from both methods, it ensures that compounds falling within the positive bins, defined as the range between the average projection score plus or minus three standard deviations, are identified as hits.\n\nRegarding the independence of training data, it is implied that the data used for training these models is independent. This is crucial for the reliability and generalizability of the meta-predictor, as it ensures that the models are not overfitted to a specific dataset and can accurately predict outcomes on new, unseen data. The use of independent training data helps in maintaining the integrity of the predictive models and enhances their performance in real-world applications.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the machine-learning algorithms employed in our study, data encoding and preprocessing were crucial steps to ensure the accuracy and reliability of our results. Initially, we filtered out compounds that demonstrated cytotoxic effects to focus on viable data points. For the Cell Painting assay, we used Harmony\u00ae PhenoLOGIC\u2122 software to extract cellular features from high-content images. This process involved applying basic flatfield and brightfield corrections, identifying nuclei using the Hoechst 33342 channel, and finding the cytoplasm with the concanavalin A-Alexa 488 channel. Border objects were removed to ensure only complete cell images were used for feature extraction. We quantified various properties, including fluorescence intensities within different cell regions, basic morphological features, advanced morphological features, and cell texture features. In total, 860 cellular features were extracted.\n\nFor the CXCL10 HTRF assay, we treated cells with a range of concentrations of adalimumab biosimilar or infliximab biosimilar, followed by various concentrations of TNF\u03b1. After 48 hours, supernatant samples were taken for CXCL10 measurement, and cells were stained with Cell Painting dyes and imaged. The Pearson\u2019s correlation between each cellular feature and the log-transformed TNF\u03b1 concentration was calculated, along with multiple testing adjusted p-values using a random permutation method. The top features were used to fit a linear regression model, which was then used to calculate scores for the experiment run. These scores were normalized to a 0-to-100 scale based on 0 and 10 ng/mL TNF\u03b1 treatments.\n\nIn the screening data analysis, we imported all extracted cellular features into TIBCO\u00ae SpotFire\u00ae Signals VitroVivo for further analysis. We used the Editable Data Grid application to associate cellular feature data with the compound transfer log file, annotating compounds accordingly. The Grid Plate Editor application was used to designate the plate layout, and the High Content Profiler performed advanced feature normalization, selection, classification, profiling, and hit selection. Compounds with scores within the range of Average(neg ctrl) \u00b1 3 S.D. were selected, and those appearing 2 times among the tested triplicates were picked as hits.\n\nFor the t-SNE visualization, compounds with target annotations were selected, and per-compound feature profiles were aggregated by calculating the mean of each feature across compound replicates. Per-target feature profiles were then aggregated by calculating the mean of each feature across all compounds annotated with that target. These profiles were rank-ordered by decreasing Euclidean distance from the mean feature profile of negative controls. The top-20 most distinct targets were selected, and those associated with 3 or fewer compounds were filtered out, resulting in a final set of 13 targets.\n\nThe two-dimensional t-SNE embedding was generated using the scikit-learn Python library with specific parameters, including random initialization, perplexity of 20, early exaggeration of 30, automatic learning rate, and squared cosine distance as a metric. Targets forming coherent clusters were highlighted using kernel density estimation with empirically chosen thresholds. It is important to note that cluster sizes and inter-cluster distances should be interpreted with care when using t-SNE.\n\nFor the correlation analysis between CXCL10 level and cellular features, we filtered out cytotoxic compounds and selected those present in both CXCL10 and imaging assays. Per-compound imaging feature profiles were aggregated by calculating the mean of each feature across compound replicates. For each cellular morphological feature, we computed two metrics of relatedness to CXCL10 level: the F-test statistic and Mutual Information (MI). The F-test statistic estimates the degree of linear dependency between the feature and the outcome, while MI can capture any kind of statistical dependency. The results were visualized either as individual data points or as a bar plot aggregating features by their type, with error bars showing a bootstrap-estimated 95% confidence interval. Computations were performed using the scikit-learn and pandas Python libraries, and visualizations were built using matplotlib and seaborn.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the number of parameters used in the model varied depending on the specific analysis method employed. For the supervised Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the number of parameters was determined by the dimensionality of the data after reduction. Similarly, for the linear predictive model, the parameters were the top features selected based on their ability to discriminate between positive and negative controls.\n\nThe selection of these parameters was driven by the need to capture the most relevant biological and morphological features from the Cell Painting assay. For the supervised PCA, we used a dimensionality reduction method that normalized the medians of positive and negative controls to 0 and 1, respectively. This allowed us to bin compounds into positive or negative categories based on their projection scores.\n\nFor the linear predictive model, we ranked features using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and calculated multiple testing adjusted p-values using a random permutation method. The top features were then selected for model training. This approach ensured that the most informative features were used to classify compounds accurately.\n\nIn summary, the number of parameters was dynamically determined by the feature selection process in each analytical method, aiming to optimize the model's performance in identifying relevant compounds.",
  "optimization/features": "In the optimization process, a total of 860 cellular features were used as input. These features were extracted using Harmony\u00ae PhenoLOGIC\u2122 software and included various categories such as fluorescence intensities, basic morphological features, advanced morphological features, and cell texture features.\n\nFeature selection was performed to identify the most relevant features for the analysis. This process involved calculating the Pearson\u2019s correlation between each cellular feature and the logarithm of TNF\u03b1 concentration. Multiple testing adjusted p-values were also calculated for each feature using a random permutation method. The top features, which showed the strongest correlation with the target variable, were selected for further analysis.\n\nThe feature selection process was conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the selected features were not influenced by the test set. This approach helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data. The selected features were then used to fit a linear regression model, which was subsequently used to calculate scores for the experiment run. The Cell Painting score was normalized to a 0-to-100 scale based on the treatments with 0 and 10 ng/mL TNF\u03b1.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in our study involved dimensionality reduction techniques, specifically supervised Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and a linear predictive model. These methods were used to analyze the Cell Painting assay data, which involved a large number of cellular features\u2014860 in total.\n\nGiven the high dimensionality of the data, the number of parameters (features) was indeed much larger than the number of training points (compounds). To address potential overfitting, we implemented several strategies. First, we used cross-validation to ensure that our models generalized well to unseen data. This involved splitting the data into training and validation sets multiple times and averaging the performance metrics. Additionally, we normalized the data by setting the medians of positive and negative controls to 0 and 1, respectively, which helped in standardizing the feature scales and reducing the risk of overfitting.\n\nTo rule out underfitting, we carefully selected features that were highly predictive and could separate positive and negative controls. This was done by ranking features using metrics such as the area under the ROC curve and calculating multiple testing adjusted p-values. Only the top features that showed strong discriminatory power were retained for the final models. Furthermore, we used a linear predictive model, which is less prone to underfitting compared to more complex models, given its simplicity and the nature of the data.\n\nThe convergence of results from both the supervised PCA and linear predictive models, with 100 overlapping hits, suggests that our fitting methods were robust and not overly sensitive to the specific choice of model. This convergence indicates that the models captured the underlying patterns in the data effectively, balancing between overfitting and underfitting.",
  "optimization/regularization": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in our study is not a black box but rather leverages transparent and interpretable methods to identify potential therapeutics for intestinal fibrosis. One of the key techniques used is Cell Painting, an image-based profiling method that provides a wealth of morphological information. This information is then analyzed using machine learning algorithms, which allow us to mine the data and reveal important biological activities of potentially therapeutic small molecules.\n\nFor instance, the relative positions of pro-fibrotic stimuli-treated clusters to vehicle controls in Cell Painting PCA plots were found to be similar to those from RNA-seq PCA plots. This similarity suggests a strong correlation between transcriptome profiles and cellular morphological profiles, making the results more interpretable.\n\nAdditionally, the use of t-SNE visualization helps in understanding the clustering of targets based on their morphological feature profiles. This visualization technique, combined with kernel density estimation, highlights targets that form coherent clusters, providing a clear and interpretable representation of the data.\n\nFurthermore, the statistical dependence analysis between CXCL10 levels and cellular features extracted from Cell Painting imaging data involves computing metrics such as the F-test statistic and Mutual Information. These metrics help in assessing the degree of dependency between features and outcomes, making the model's predictions more transparent and interpretable.\n\nOverall, the integration of image-based profiling with machine learning and statistical analysis ensures that the model is not a black box but a transparent system that provides clear insights into the biological activities of potential therapeutics.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in our study is primarily a regression model. Specifically, we utilized a linear regression model to fit the top features extracted from the Cell Painting assay. This model was used to calculate scores for the experiment runs, which were then normalized to a 0-to-100 scale based on treatments with varying concentrations of TNF\u03b1. Additionally, we used a linear predictive model for analyzing the Cell Painting dataset, where positive and negative controls served as the training set. The features were ranked using the area under the ROC curve, and multiple testing adjusted p-values were calculated for each feature using a random permutation method. This approach allowed us to identify and select compounds that showed significant effects in our assays.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time for the model varied depending on the specific tasks and analyses performed. For the Cell Painting assay, the imaging process involved capturing the middle 9 fields of view for each well using a 20x water objective in non-confocal mode. The exposure time and power were adjusted to ensure optimal signal levels. After imaging, the data was processed using Harmony\u00ae PhenoLOGIC\u2122 software, which applied basic flatfield and brightfield corrections. The Hoechst 33342 channel was used to identify nuclei, followed by the concanavalin A-Alexa 488 channel to find the cytoplasm.

Top features were ranked using the area under the ROC curve, and multiple testing adjusted p-values were calculated. The execution time for these analyses depended on the computational resources and the complexity of the data, but the processes were designed to be efficient and scalable.",

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the methods employed in our study involved several rigorous steps to ensure the robustness and reliability of our findings. For the CXCL10 assay, the evaluation began with the normalization of luminescence intensities of positive and negative controls on a 0 to 1 scale. This normalization allowed for the calculation of percent inhibition, with the mean of the positive control set at 100% and the mean of the negative control at 0%. The strictly standardized mean difference (SSMD) was used to measure the effect size and gauge the assay quality. Plates with an SSMD greater than 1.28 proceeded to hit selection, indicating a high-quality assay. Compounds that showed CXCL10 inhibition greater than 70% in more than two out of three replicates were identified as preliminary hits. These hits were then filtered to eliminate cytotoxic compounds, based on cell count data from the imaging assay.\n\nFor the Cell Painting assay, the evaluation involved the projection of scores, which were calculated using a mathematical formalization that predicted a sample's positivity based on its feature values' proximity to positive and negative controls. Compounds with projection scores within the range of the average of the negative control plus or minus three standard deviations were selected as hits. Additionally, compounds that had three or more data points meeting this criterion out of six were confirmed as hits.\n\nThe t-SNE visualization was used to generate a two-dimensional embedding of the Cell Painting morphological feature profiles. This visualization helped in identifying compounds that formed coherent clusters, indicating similar phenotypic responses. The t-SNE embedding was generated using specific parameters, including a perplexity of 20, early exaggeration of 30, and squared cosine distance as a metric. Targets that formed coherent clusters were highlighted using kernel density estimation.\n\nThe statistical dependence between CXCL10 levels and cellular features was assessed using two metrics: the F-test statistic and mutual information. The F-test statistic estimated the degree of linear dependency between the features and the CXCL10 level, while mutual information captured any kind of statistical dependency. These metrics were computed for each cellular morphological feature, and the results were visualized using individual data points or aggregated bar plots.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation methods included normalization and SSMD for the CXCL10 assay, projection scores and t-SNE visualization for the Cell Painting assay, and statistical dependence analysis for correlating CXCL10 levels with cellular features. These steps ensured a comprehensive and reliable evaluation of the methods used in our study.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed several performance metrics to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of our assays. For the CXCL10 assay, we utilized the strictly standardized mean difference (SSMD) to measure the effect size and gauge the assay quality. Plates with an SSMD greater than 1.28, which is the quality cutoff, proceeded to hit selection. This metric is widely recognized in the literature for its ability to assess assay quality by standardizing the mean difference between positive and negative controls.\n\nFor hit selection in the CXCL10 assay, compounds that were positive in more than two out of three replicates with CXCL10 inhibition greater than 70% were identified as preliminary hits. These hits were then filtered to eliminate cytotoxic compounds, ensuring that only non-toxic compounds were advanced. This gating strategy resulted in a hit rate of 2.2% for the CXCL10 screen.\n\nIn the Cell Painting assay, we used projection scores to rank compounds. These scores were calculated based on the distance between the sample and the centers of positive and negative controls, providing a heuristic for predicting sample positivity. Compounds with scores within the range of the average of the negative control plus or minus one standard deviation and appearing at least twice were picked as hits.\n\nAdditionally, we assessed the correlation between CXCL10 levels and cellular features extracted from Cell Painting imaging data. We computed two metrics of relatedness: the F-test statistic, which estimates the degree of linear dependency between the feature and the outcome, and mutual information, which can capture any kind of statistical dependency. These metrics helped us identify cellular features that had strong relationships with CXCL10 levels, providing insights into the biological functions correlated with these features.\n\nOverall, the performance metrics used in our study are representative of those commonly reported in the literature. The SSMD is a standard metric for assay quality, and the use of projection scores and statistical dependence measures for hit selection and feature correlation is well-established in high-throughput screening and image-based profiling studies. These metrics collectively ensure the robustness and reliability of our findings.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we conducted a comprehensive comparison of different methods to identify hit compounds for reducing CXCL10 levels and analyzing cellular morphology through the Cell Painting assay. We employed both supervised Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and linear predictive models to analyze the Cell Painting dataset. These methods allowed us to determine the similarities between compounds and controls by examining projection scores.\n\nFor the CXCL10 reduction assay, we utilized a high-throughput screening approach with luminescence intensities, which were normalized and fit on a 0 to 1 scale. The strictly standardized mean difference (SSMD) was used to measure the effect size and gauge the assay quality. Plates with an SSMD greater than 1.28 proceeded to hit selection, where compounds showing inhibition greater than 70% in more than two out of three replicates were identified as preliminary hits. These hits were further filtered to eliminate cytotoxic compounds based on cell count.\n\nThe comparison between the Cell Painting and CXCL10 assays revealed that they identified vastly different pools of hit compounds. For instance, the Cell Painting assay highlighted targets such as VEGFR, HSP, c-Met, and PDGFR, while the CXCL10 assay focused on targets like mTOR, PI3K, and components of the autophagy and microtubule pathways. Only a small number of hits overlapped between the two assays, indicating the unique strengths and perspectives each method brings to the analysis.\n\nWe also explored the predictive abilities of image-based profiles from the Cell Painting assay. By studying the statistical dependence between CXCL10 levels and individual cellular features, we found that certain features, such as Axial Small Length and Radial Mean from various cellular components, had strong relationships with CXCL10 levels. This analysis was conducted using both F-test statistics and mutual information, providing a robust assessment of the linear and non-linear dependencies between features and CXCL10 levels.\n\nIn summary, our methods comparison involved a detailed analysis of different hit-picking strategies and their respective strengths. We did not perform a direct comparison to publicly available methods on benchmark datasets, but our approach involved rigorous statistical analyses and filtering criteria to ensure the reliability and relevance of the identified hits. The use of both supervised PCA and linear predictive models, along with the integration of morphological and biochemical data, provided a comprehensive evaluation of the compounds' effects on CXCL10 reduction and cellular morphology.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our methods involved rigorous statistical analysis to ensure the confidence and significance of our results. We employed the strictly standardized mean difference (SSMD) to assess plate quality and gauge assay performance. This metric provided a clear indication of the effect size and helped in determining the quality cutoff for proceeding with hit selection.\n\nFor the CXCL10 assay, we used the SSMD quality cutoff of >1.28 to identify plates that met the necessary standards. This ensured that only high-quality data proceeded to the hit selection stage. Compounds were considered preliminary hits if they showed CXCL10 inhibition greater than 70% in more than two out of three replicates. These hits were then filtered to eliminate cytotoxic compounds, ensuring that the selected hits were both effective and non-toxic.\n\nIn the Cell Painting assay, we calculated projection scores to rank compounds based on their similarity to positive and negative controls. Compounds with scores within the range of Average(neg ctrl) \u00b1 1 S.D. and appearing at least twice were picked as hits. This approach helped in identifying compounds that consistently showed the desired effects.\n\nStatistical significance was assessed using T-tests or one-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s post hoc test, depending on the experimental design. Results were presented with means \u00b1 SD or means \u00b1 SEM, and significance levels were indicated as * p<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001, and **** p<0.0001. This rigorous statistical analysis ensured that our findings were robust and reliable.\n\nAdditionally, we used bootstrap-estimated 95% confidence intervals to provide a measure of uncertainty around our estimates. This was particularly important in the correlation analysis between CXCL10 levels and cellular features, where we computed F-test statistics and mutual information to assess the degree of dependency.\n\nOverall, the evaluation confidence was high, with clear performance metrics, statistical significance, and confidence intervals providing a comprehensive assessment of our methods' effectiveness.",
