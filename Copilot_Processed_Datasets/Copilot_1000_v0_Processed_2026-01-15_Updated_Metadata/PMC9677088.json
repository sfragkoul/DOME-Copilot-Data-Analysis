  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was derived from participants enrolled in the FAITH! Trial, a community-based clinical trial focused on cardiovascular health. Specifically, the data comes from the Heart Health + study, an ancillary study of the FAITH! Trial. A total of 63 participants out of 85 from the FAITH! Trial were successfully enrolled in the Heart Health + study, with 54 participants completing both an ECG and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) between February and April 2022.\n\nThe participants were African-American adults who owned smartphones, had basic internet skills, and at least weekly internet and email access. They were recruited from partnering churches in Rochester and Minneapolis, Minnesota. The dataset includes cardiovascular testing results, such as standard 12-lead ECGs and limited TTEs, which were analyzed using previously published AI algorithms. The AI-ECG predictions generated included age, sex, and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).\n\nThe data used in this study has not been previously published or used by the community in the same context. The study represents a novel application of AI-enhanced ECG data for cardiovascular disease screening in an under-resourced African-American cohort. The dataset is unique in its focus on community-based participatory research and the use of AI for health equity in cardiovascular health.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in this study is convolutional neural networks. These networks are a type of deep learning algorithm that has been widely used in various medical imaging applications, including electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis.\n\nThe specific convolutional neural networks employed in this research were previously published and are embedded in the electronic medical record system via an AI-ECG Dashboard. These algorithms have been developed and validated in prior studies, focusing on predicting age, sex, and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from standard 12-lead ECGs.\n\nGiven that the algorithms are not new but have been adapted for use in this specific community-based study, they were not published in a machine-learning journal. Instead, the focus of this publication is on the application and validation of these algorithms in a community-based, African-American cohort to assess their reliability and potential utility in screening for cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The study aims to evaluate the performance of these AI-ECG algorithms in a real-world setting, particularly in under-resourced populations, to provide valuable screening resources and appropriate referrals for early detection of highly-morbid CVD.",
  "optimization/meta": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure the electrocardiogram (ECG) data was suitable for analysis. The ECGs were acquired using a standard, digital, 10-second 12-lead ECG protocol. These ECGs were then analyzed using previously published convolutional neural networks embedded in the electronic medical record system via an AI-ECG Dashboard. The ECG data, including the date, acquisition location, and rhythm, were extracted from the MUSE system. The rhythm, ECG characteristics, and echocardiographic findings, including left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), were adjudicated by a technologist under cardiologist supervision.\n\nThe AI-ECG prediction probabilities were generated for age, sex, and decreased LVEF. Decreased LVEF in our cohort was defined as a value below 50%, which is slightly more lenient than the national/international definition of reduced LVEF below 40%. The LVEF was visually estimated from the transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) images. The ECGs were analyzed using convolutional neural networks, which are a type of deep learning algorithm particularly effective for image and signal processing tasks. These networks were trained to recognize patterns in the ECG data that correlate with the desired predictions, such as age, sex, and LVEF.\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using R version 4.1.2. Patient demographic variables were summarized as totals with percentages for categorical variables and means with standard deviations for continuous variables. The diagnostic accuracy of the AI-ECG to detect decreased LVEF and predict participant sex was quantified using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC). Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for decreased LVEF and sex prediction using specific cut-offs for AI-ECG predicted probabilities. The correlation between actual age and AI-ECG predicted age was assessed using Pearson correlation coefficients.",
  "optimization/parameters": "Not applicable",
  "optimization/features": "The study utilized electrocardiogram (ECG) data as the primary input for the artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. Specifically, the ECGs were standard, digital, 10-second 12-lead recordings. The features extracted from these ECGs included rhythm, characteristics, and other relevant data points. The AI-ECG Dashboard, embedded in the electronic medical record system, analyzed these ECGs using convolutional neural networks to generate prediction probabilities for age, sex, and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).\n\nFeature selection was not explicitly mentioned as a separate process in the study. However, the use of convolutional neural networks implies that the model likely learned to identify and weigh the most relevant features from the raw ECG data during the training phase. This approach leverages the network's ability to automatically extract and prioritize important features from the input data, rather than relying on manual feature selection.\n\nThe training and validation of the AI algorithms were performed using previously published models, which suggests that the feature extraction and selection processes were likely conducted using the training sets from those original studies. This ensures that the models are robust and generalizable to new data, including the community-based cohort studied here. The focus was on evaluating the performance of these pre-existing AI-ECG algorithms in a specific population, rather than developing new features or selection methods.",

  "optimization/regularization": "Not applicable",
  "optimization/config": "Not applicable.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model utilized in our study is based on convolutional neural networks, which are inherently complex and often considered black-box models. These networks are designed to learn and make decisions based on patterns in data, but the internal workings and the specific features they use to make predictions are not easily interpretable by humans. This complexity allows the model to capture intricate relationships within the data, but it also means that the decision-making process is not transparent.\n\nHowever, the model's performance metrics provide some level of interpretability. For instance, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for predicting decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 0.892, indicating strong discriminative ability. Similarly, the AUC for predicting participant sex was 0.944, demonstrating high accuracy in this task. These metrics give us confidence in the model's reliability, even if the internal mechanisms are not fully transparent.\n\nAdditionally, the strong correlation (R = 0.769) between the actual age and the AI-ECG predicted age suggests that the model is effectively capturing relevant age-related features from the ECG data. This correlation provides some insight into the model's ability to generalize and make accurate predictions based on the input data.\n\nWhile the model itself is not transparent, the use of well-established statistical methods for evaluating its performance helps to provide a clearer understanding of its capabilities and limitations. The sensitivity and specificity values for decreased LVEF and sex prediction further support the model's effectiveness, even if the underlying decision-making process remains opaque.",
  "model/output": "The model in question is primarily a classification model, but it also includes regression components. Specifically, it classifies decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and predicts participant sex, both of which are classification tasks. Additionally, it predicts age, which is a regression task. The model's performance was evaluated using metrics appropriate for both classification and regression, such as area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and correlation coefficients.\n\nThe AI-ECG model demonstrated excellent performance in detecting decreased LVEF, with an AUC of 0.892, sensitivity of 50%, and specificity of 96%. For predicting participant sex, the model achieved an AUC of 0.944, with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 77.8%. The model's age predictions showed a strong correlation with actual ages, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.769 and an average prediction error of 0.024 years.\n\nThese results indicate that the model is reliable for both classification and regression tasks in a community-based, African-American cohort. The model's ability to accurately predict age, sex, and decreased LVEF suggests its potential utility in community-based screening for cardiovascular disease, particularly in under-resourced populations.",

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method involved assessing the diagnostic accuracy of AI-enhanced electrocardiograms (AI-ECGs) for detecting decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and predicting participant sex. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to quantify this accuracy. For decreased LVEF, the AI-ECG demonstrated excellent performance with an AUC of 0.892. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated using a cut-off of AI-ECG predicted probability greater than 0.256, resulting in a sensitivity of 50% and a specificity of 96%.\n\nFor predicting participant sex, the AI-ECG also showed strong performance with an AUC of 0.944. Sensitivity and specificity were determined using a cut-off of AI-ECG predicted probability greater than 0.48, yielding a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 77.8%.\n\nAdditionally, the correlation between actual age and AI-ECG predicted age was assessed using Pearson correlation coefficients. The AI-ECG predicted mean age was 55 years, with a strong correlation to actual age (R = 0.769; p < 0.001). This indicates that the AI-ECG algorithms reliably predicted age within the cohort.\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using R version 4.1.2. The evaluation included a diverse group of participants, with a mean age of 55 years and 66.7% being female, reflecting the broader study population. The results suggest that the AI-ECG algorithms are effective in predicting age, sex, and decreased LVEF in a community-based, African-American cohort.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we evaluated the performance of AI-enhanced electrocardiography (AI-ECG) using several key metrics to ensure a comprehensive assessment. The primary metrics reported include the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity.\n\nFor the prediction of participant sex, the AI-ECG demonstrated an AUC of 0.944, indicating strong discriminative ability. The sensitivity was 100%, meaning that all true positive cases were correctly identified, and the specificity was 77.8%, reflecting the proportion of true negative cases correctly identified.\n\nIn the detection of decreased Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF), the AI-ECG showed an AUC of 0.892, which also signifies robust performance. The sensitivity for this metric was 50%, and the specificity was 96%, highlighting the model's effectiveness in correctly identifying both positive and negative cases.\n\nAdditionally, we assessed the correlation between actual age and AI-ECG predicted age using the Pearson correlation coefficient, which was 0.769, indicating a strong positive correlation. This metric is crucial for evaluating the accuracy of age prediction by the AI-ECG.\n\nThese performance metrics are representative of those commonly reported in the literature for similar AI models in cardiovascular health. The inclusion of AUC, sensitivity, and specificity provides a well-rounded view of the model's diagnostic accuracy, while the correlation coefficient offers insights into the model's predictive power for age estimation. Together, these metrics ensure that our evaluation is thorough and aligned with standard practices in the field.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "Not applicable.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the AI-ECG algorithms in this study includes several performance metrics with associated confidence intervals, providing a clear indication of the reliability and statistical significance of the results.\n\nThe area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for detecting decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was reported as 0.892 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.708 to 1. This wide range suggests some variability in the performance, but the lower bound still indicates strong discriminatory power. The sensitivity for detecting decreased LVEF was 50% (95% CI: 9.5%-90.5%), and the specificity was 96% (95% CI: 86.8%-98.9%). These metrics, along with their confidence intervals, provide a comprehensive view of the algorithm's performance and its potential variability.\n\nFor predicting participant sex, the AUC was 0.944 (95% CI: 0.891-0.998), demonstrating excellent performance. The sensitivity was 100% (95% CI: 82.4%-100.0%), and the specificity was 77.8% (95% CI: 61.9%-88.3%). These high values, coupled with narrow confidence intervals, indicate strong and reliable performance in sex prediction.\n\nThe correlation between actual age and AI-ECG predicted age was assessed using Pearson correlation coefficients, resulting in a strong correlation (R = 0.769; p < 0.001). The p-value indicates that the correlation is statistically significant, reinforcing the reliability of the age prediction model.\n\nOverall, the inclusion of confidence intervals and statistically significant p-values in the performance metrics provides a robust evaluation of the AI-ECG algorithms. This ensures that the claims of superior performance and reliability are well-supported by the data.",
