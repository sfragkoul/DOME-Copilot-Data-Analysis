  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from patients with diabetes and impaired renal function (CKD Stage 3 or 4) who were enrolled in follow-up studies conducted between 1991 and 2009 at the Joslin Clinic. The majority of these patients were enrolled in the 2000s and were followed until 2012-2013. The study group comprised two independent cohorts: one with Type 1 diabetes (T1D) and proteinuria, and another with Type 2 diabetes (T2D) with microalbuminuria or proteinuria. The T1D cohort served as the training panel, while the T2D cohort served as the validation panel.\n\nThe T1D cohort consisted of patients who had long-duration diabetes, poor glycemic control, and 85% received RAS blockade. Eligibility required that proteinuria was documented by multiple ACR measurements during the 2-year interval preceding enrollment. The median ACR for the whole group was 827 mg/g, and renal function was impaired with a median eGFR of 40 mL/min. Median serum concentrations of TNFR1 and TNFR2 at baseline were almost twice as high as in T1D patients with normoalbuminuria and normal renal function.\n\nThe T2D cohort had similar characteristics but was used to validate the findings from the T1D cohort. The study aimed to identify an optimal enrollment criterion for clinical trials by evaluating clinical characteristics and markers, including ACR, eGFR, TNFR1, and TNFR2. The dataset included follow-up data on occurrences of ESRD, 40% loss of baseline eGFR, or death unrelated to ESRD within three years.\n\nThe study used machine learning methods, specifically Classification and Regression Trees (CART), to identify the smallest set of best-performing clinical characteristics/markers and to determine cut-points that maximize the separation between patients at high risk of an outcome and those who are not. The dataset was also used to illustrate the impact of the optimal enrollment criterion on reducing sample size while increasing statistical power in a hypothetical 3-year clinical trial. Additionally, data on patients excluded from 3-year trials by this new criterion were used to determine the magnitude of the ESRD risk problem that cannot be studied in clinical trials as currently constrained.",
  "dataset/splits": "The study involved two independent cohorts of patients with diabetes and impaired renal function. The first cohort consisted of patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and proteinuria, serving as the training panel. The second cohort included patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and either microalbuminuria or proteinuria, acting as the validation panel.\n\nThe T1D cohort had a larger number of renal outcomes and was used to develop the initial model. This cohort included patients with long-duration diabetes, poor glycemic control, and a median albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 827 mg/g. The median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 40 mL/min, indicating impaired renal function.\n\nThe T2D cohort was used to validate the findings from the T1D cohort. The characteristics of both cohorts are summarized in a table, providing details on age, duration of diabetes, glycemic control, and other relevant clinical parameters.\n\nInitially, the model was built using the T1D cohort and then tested on the T2D cohort to assess its replicability. The cut-points identified in the T1D cohort were applied to the T2D patients to compare predictions. Based on the good replication of findings, the multi-marker decision rule was re-estimated using the combined data from both T1D and T2D cohorts. This combined analysis helped in determining a final clinical trial enrollment criterion.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The study utilized two independent cohorts of patients with diabetes and impaired renal function, specifically those in CKD Stage 3 or 4. These cohorts were enrolled in follow-up studies conducted between 1991 and 2009, with the majority of patients enrolled in the 2000s and followed until 2012-2013. The cohorts were derived from patients who had been under the care of the Joslin Clinic for an extended period, ensuring that their inclusion in the prospective studies was unrelated to their future outcomes.\n\nThe Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) cohort, which had a higher number of renal outcomes, served as the training panel. This cohort consisted of patients with proteinuria and long-duration diabetes, poor glycemic control, and a significant proportion receiving RAS blockade. The Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) cohort, which had microalbuminuria or proteinuria, served as the validation panel. The characteristics of these cohorts were summarized in a table, highlighting differences in demographics and clinical markers.\n\nTo ensure independence between the training and test sets, the T1D cohort was used to develop the multi-marker decision rule, while the T2D cohort was used to validate the findings. This approach helped to assess the replicability of the results across different patient populations. Additionally, the cut-points identified in the T1D cohort were applied to the T2D patients to calculate the proportion of cases in the terminal nodes, comparing predictions between the two cohorts.\n\nThe distribution of the datasets in this study is notable for its focus on patients with advanced kidney disease, which is a critical factor in the progression to ESRD. This focus differs from some previously published machine learning datasets that may include patients with earlier stages of kidney disease or different demographic characteristics. The study's emphasis on patients with CKD Stage 3 or 4 ensures that the findings are relevant to a high-risk population, which is crucial for developing effective enrollment criteria for clinical trials aimed at preventing ESRD.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in this study falls under the class of decision tree methods, specifically utilizing Classification and Regression Trees (CART). This approach is well-established and not new, having been previously developed and applied in various fields.\n\nCART is a type of machine learning algorithm that is used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by recursively partitioning the data into subsets based on the values of input variables, creating a tree-like structure of decisions. The goal is to identify the smallest set of the best-performing clinical characteristics or markers and to find cut-points for each that maximize the separation between patients who are at high risk of an outcome and those who are not.\n\nThe decision to use CART in this context was driven by its ability to handle complex interactions between variables and to provide a simple, interpretable model. This is particularly important in clinical settings where transparency and ease of implementation are crucial. The algorithm's effectiveness in identifying high-risk patients for enrollment in clinical trials was demonstrated through its application to cohorts of patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease.\n\nThe choice of CART over other machine learning algorithms was likely influenced by its robustness and the need for a straightforward enrollment criterion that could be easily applied in clinical practice. The algorithm's performance was validated across different cohorts, ensuring its generalizability and reliability.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. It is not a meta-predictor. The approach used is Classification and Regression Trees (CART), which is a standalone machine learning method. CART was applied to identify the smallest set of the best performing clinical characteristics/markers and to search for values (cut-points) for each that maximizes separation between patients who are or are not at high risk of an outcome.\n\nThe CART analysis was initially applied to the T1D cohort as the training or discovery set. It used four clinical characteristics (sex, age, systolic BP, and HbA1c) and four candidate markers (ACR, eGFR, TNFR1, and TNFR2) to build a multi-marker tree. The cut-points identified in the T1D cohort were then applied to T2D patients to test the replicability of the findings. The proportion of cases in the terminal nodes was calculated to compare predictions in T1D and T2D patients. Based on the good replication of the findings, the multi-marker decision rule was re-estimated in the T1D and T2D cohorts pooled together.\n\nThe training data for the initial CART analysis was independent, as it was derived from the T1D cohort. The validation was performed using the T2D cohort, ensuring that the data used for validation was separate from the training data. This approach helps to confirm the generalizability of the findings across different patient populations.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps. Initially, the study focused on patients with diabetes and impaired renal function, specifically those in CKD stages 3 or 4. The cohorts included patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), with the T1D cohort serving as the training panel and the T2D cohort as the validation panel.\n\nFor the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) analysis, various clinical characteristics and markers were considered. These included sex, age, systolic blood pressure, HbA1c, albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and serum levels of Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptors 1 and 2 (TNFR1 and TNFR2). The CART method was used to identify optimal cut-points in these markers that maximized the separation between patients at high risk of developing endpoints such as ESRD, a 40% loss of eGFR, or death within three years.\n\nThe recursive partitioning process involved setting standard default parameters, with a minimum size of terminal nodes at 5 patients and attempting partitions in nodes with at least 20 individuals. To simplify the final eligibility rule, cut-points where both daughter nodes provided the same binary event prediction were removed. This ensured that the risk of the outcome was either greater than 50% or less than 50% in both nodes.\n\nThe data was further processed by applying the cut-points identified in the T1D cohort to the T2D patients to test the replicability of the findings. The proportion of cases in the terminal nodes was calculated to compare predictions in both T1D and T2D patients. Based on the good replication of findings, the multi-marker decision rule was re-estimated in the combined T1D and T2D cohorts.\n\nAdditionally, a logistic regression model was used as an alternative to derive a score calculated from markers weighted by regression parameters. The performance of CART and logistic regression was compared by selecting a cutoff in the score that identified the same number of T1D patients as the CART method. This ensured a comprehensive evaluation of different approaches to data encoding and preprocessing.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In the optimization process, a total of eight parameters were used in the model. These parameters included four clinical characteristics: sex, age, systolic blood pressure, and HbA1c. Additionally, four markers were considered: estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), and tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2). The selection of these parameters was based on their known associations with the risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in diabetic patients. The choice of these specific markers and clinical characteristics was driven by their relevance to renal function and disease progression, as well as their potential to enhance the prognostic value and sensitivity of the enrollment criterion in clinical trials.",
  "optimization/features": "The optimization process involved the use of four clinical characteristics and four candidate markers as input features. The clinical characteristics considered were sex, age, systolic blood pressure, and HbA1c. The candidate markers included albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), and tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2).\n\nFeature selection was performed using the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) method. This method was applied to the training set, which consisted of patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D), to identify the optimal cut-points in the distribution of each marker. The goal was to find the smallest set of the best-performing clinical characteristics and markers that maximized the separation between patients at high risk of an outcome and those who were not. The selected features were then validated using a separate cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) to ensure the replicability of the findings. The final enrollment criterion was determined by re-estimating the multi-marker decision rule in the combined T1D and T2D cohorts.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study utilized Classification and Regression Trees (CART), a machine learning technique that is particularly effective for identifying the smallest set of best-performing clinical characteristics and markers. This method searches for optimal cut-points that maximize the separation between patients at high risk of an outcome and those who are not.\n\nThe CART approach was applied to a training set consisting of patients with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) and a validation set of patients with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). The training set included a variety of clinical characteristics such as sex, age, systolic blood pressure, and HbA1c, along with markers like ACR, eGFR, TNFR1, and TNFR2. The validation set was used to test the replicability of the findings from the T1D cohort.\n\nTo ensure that the model was not overfitting, several measures were taken. The minimum size of terminal nodes was set at 5 patients, and partitioning was attempted only in nodes with at least 20 individuals. Additionally, the tree size was limited by removing cut-points where both daughter nodes provided the same binary event prediction, ensuring that the risk of the outcome was either greater than 50% or less than 50% in both nodes. This simplification helped in creating a more generalizable model.\n\nThe model's performance was evaluated based on its predictive value and sensitivity. The predictive value, or the proportion of test-positive patients who became cases, was the primary focus. Sensitivity, or the proportion of cases who were test-positive, was a secondary consideration. This dual focus helped in balancing the model's ability to identify high-risk patients without overfitting to the training data.\n\nThe CART method was compared with an alternative approach using logistic regression to derive a score calculated from markers weighted by regression parameters. The performance of both methods was evaluated, and the CART method was found to be simpler and slightly better performing. This comparison further validated the robustness of the CART approach in developing prognostic tests.\n\nIn summary, the CART method was chosen for its ability to handle a relatively large number of parameters compared to the number of training points. Overfitting was ruled out through careful tree pruning and validation, while underfitting was avoided by ensuring that the model captured the essential patterns in the data. The method's performance was rigorously tested and validated, ensuring its reliability for identifying high-risk patients in clinical trials.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting during the recursive partitioning process. We set a minimum size of terminal nodes at 5 patients, ensuring that each leaf of the decision tree contained a sufficient number of observations. Additionally, we required that a partition be attempted in a node with at least 20 individuals, which helped to maintain a balance between model complexity and generalization.\n\nTo simplify the final eligibility rule, we limited the tree size by removing cut-points where both daughter nodes provided the same binary event prediction. This means that if the risk of the outcome was either greater than 50% or less than 50% in both daughter nodes, the cut-point was eliminated. This approach helped to create a more interpretable and generalizable model by avoiding overly complex trees that might capture noise in the data.\n\nFurthermore, we validated our findings by applying the cut-points identified in the Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) cohort to Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) patients. This cross-validation step helped to ensure that our model was not overfitting to the specific characteristics of the T1D cohort and could generalize to a different but related population. Based on the good replication of our findings, we re-estimated the multi-marker decision rule in the combined T1D and T2D cohorts, further enhancing the robustness of our model.",
  "optimization/config": "Not applicable.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a blackbox. It utilizes a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) approach, which is inherently interpretable. The CART method generates a decision tree that is easy to visualize and understand. Each split in the tree is based on a single feature, making it straightforward to trace the decision-making process.\n\nFor instance, the final eligibility rule derived from the CART model is based on cut-points in just two markers: TNFR1 and ACR. Patients with TNFR1 levels greater than 4.3 ng/ml are identified as high risk. Similarly, patients with TNFR1 levels between 2.9 and 4.3 ng/ml and ACR levels greater than 1.9 g/g are also classified as high risk. These rules are simple and directly interpretable, providing clear criteria for identifying high-risk patients.\n\nThe decision tree's structure allows for easy visualization of how different combinations of marker values lead to specific risk classifications. This transparency is crucial for clinical applications, as it enables healthcare providers to understand and communicate the rationale behind patient risk assessments. Additionally, the model's simplicity and clarity make it practical for use in clinical settings, where interpretability is essential for decision-making and patient care.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in this study is primarily a classification model. The Classification and Regression Trees (CART) method was used to identify optimal cut-points for markers, which were then used to classify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups for developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or experiencing a significant decline in kidney function. The focus was on the predictive value and sensitivity of these criteria, which are typical metrics for evaluating classification models. Additionally, a logistic regression model was used as an alternative approach to derive a score for classifying patients based on weighted markers. The output of these models provides a binary classification of patients into high-risk and low-risk categories, which is characteristic of classification models.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "Not applicable.",
  "evaluation/method": "The method was evaluated using a combination of training and validation cohorts. The training cohort consisted of patients with type 1 diabetes, while the validation cohort included patients with type 2 diabetes. The Classification and Regression Trees (CART) method was applied to the training cohort to identify optimal cut-points for various clinical characteristics and markers. These cut-points were then tested on the validation cohort to assess their replicability and performance.\n\nThe evaluation focused on the predictive value and sensitivity of the criteria. The predictive value measured the proportion of test-positive patients who became cases within three years, while sensitivity measured the proportion of cases who were test-positive. The method's performance was compared using cumulative incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) by the end of the third year of follow-up.\n\nAdditionally, a logistic regression model was used as an alternative to derive a score from markers weighted by regression parameters. The performance of CART and logistic regression was compared by selecting a cutoff in the score that identified the same number of patients as the CART method.\n\nThe final enrollment criterion was determined by re-fitting the diagnostic tree to the combined cohorts of type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients. This criterion was evaluated for its prognostic value and sensitivity in both cohorts. The impact of the new enrollment criterion on the statistical power of a clinical trial was also illustrated by simulating a study population and comparing the power to detect treatment effects using the new criterion versus previous criteria.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we evaluated the performance of our enrollment criteria using several key metrics to ensure a comprehensive assessment. The primary metrics reported include predictive value and sensitivity. Predictive value, also known as positive predictive value, measures the proportion of patients identified as high-risk who actually experienced the endpoint within three years. Sensitivity, on the other hand, indicates the proportion of all patients who experienced the endpoint that were correctly identified by our criteria.\n\nThese metrics were chosen to align with standard practices in the field, ensuring that our results are comparable to other studies. Predictive value is crucial for understanding the effectiveness of the criteria in identifying truly high-risk patients, while sensitivity is important for capturing as many cases as possible. Additionally, we provided negative predictive value and specificity for completeness. Negative predictive value measures the proportion of patients excluded from the trial who did not experience the endpoint, and specificity measures the proportion of patients without endpoints who were correctly identified as low-risk.\n\nThe use of these metrics allows for a thorough evaluation of our enrollment criteria, providing insights into both the accuracy and the coverage of our approach. This set of metrics is representative of the literature, as similar measures are commonly used in studies evaluating prognostic tests and enrollment criteria for clinical trials. By reporting these metrics, we aim to demonstrate the robustness and reliability of our criteria in identifying patients at high risk of ESRD, thereby enhancing the design and power of future clinical trials.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "A comparison was made between the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) method and a logistic regression model. The CART approach was used to derive a multi-marker decision tree, while the logistic regression model was used to create a score based on markers weighted by regression parameters. To ensure a fair comparison, a cutoff in the logistic regression score was selected to identify the same number of high-risk patients as the CART method. This allowed for a direct comparison of the performance of both methods in identifying trial-eligible patients. Additionally, the performance of the CART method was evaluated across different cohorts, including Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) patients, to assess its replicability and generalizability. The results of these comparisons are presented in the supplemental material.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our method involved a detailed analysis of performance metrics, including predictive value and sensitivity. These metrics were calculated for both Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) cohorts, providing a robust assessment of our approach.\n\nThe predictive value and sensitivity were reported with specific percentages, indicating the proportion of test-positive patients who became cases and the proportion of cases who were test-positive, respectively. For instance, the predictive value was 85% and sensitivity was 72% for the initial criterion in the T1D cohort. When applied to the T2D cohort, these values were 71% and 57%, respectively. These percentages suggest a strong performance, but confidence intervals were not explicitly mentioned, which would typically provide a range within which the true values lie with a certain level of confidence.\n\nStatistical significance was implied through the replication of findings across different cohorts. The method was first applied to the T1D cohort and then validated in the T2D cohort, showing similar results. This replication strengthens the claim that the method is reliable and generalizable. Additionally, the use of recursive partitioning and logistic regression models further supports the robustness of our findings.\n\nThe comparison with other methods, such as traditional renal markers and clinical characteristics, also highlights the superiority of our approach. The high predictive value and sensitivity of our criterion suggest that it is more effective in identifying high-risk patients compared to existing models. However, without explicit p-values or confidence intervals, it is challenging to quantify the statistical significance of these comparisons.\n\nIn summary, while the performance metrics indicate a strong and reliable method, the lack of explicit confidence intervals and p-values makes it difficult to provide a precise evaluation of statistical significance. The replication of results across different cohorts and the comparison with other methods do, however, provide a solid foundation for claiming the superiority of our approach.",
