  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in our study is the random forest algorithm. This algorithm was employed to evaluate the predictive power of validated proteins in distinguishing between different types of thyroid nodules and to establish a clinical predictive model.\n\nThe random forest algorithm is not new; it is a well-established ensemble learning method used for classification and regression tasks. It operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.\n\nThe reason this algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that our primary focus was on identifying potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) rather than developing new machine-learning techniques. We utilized the random forest algorithm as a tool to analyze and validate our proteomic data, which is a common practice in biomedical research. The application of this algorithm in our study was to enhance the understanding of PTMC and to provide insights into potential biomarkers, rather than to contribute to the field of machine learning.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employs a meta-predictor approach, integrating results from multiple machine-learning algorithms to enhance predictive performance. Specifically, the model utilizes a random forest strategy to sort and select target proteins based on their characteristics. This process involves receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis, where the area under the curve (AUC) serves as a key indicator of model performance.\n\nThe meta-predictor leverages several machine-learning methods, including partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) and logistic regression. The PLS-DA is used to identify proteins with a variable importance in projection (VIP) greater than 1, which are considered meaningful for sample discrimination. Logistic regression, with specific parameters such as solver='liblinear' and class weight='balanced', is employed as the classifier. Additionally, leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation is applied to select candidate biomarkers, ensuring robust model training and evaluation.\n\nThe training data for the meta-predictor is derived from a validation set of 20 pairs of specimens, which were detected using parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). This ensures that the training data is independent and not contaminated by the test data, maintaining the integrity of the model's predictive capabilities. The use of independent training data is crucial for validating the model's performance and generalizability.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps. Initially, protein extraction and trypsin digestion were performed on the samples. The resulting peptides were then labeled using tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling kits, which allowed for the quantification of proteins across multiple samples. The labeled peptides were analyzed using liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS), and the data were processed using the MaxQuant search engine. This involved aligning the tandem mass spectra with the human Swiss-Prot database, setting parameters for precursor and fragment ion mass tolerances, and specifying modifications such as carbamidomethyl on Cys and oxidation on Met. The false discovery rate was set at less than 1%, ensuring the reliability of the identified peptides. Following this, the data were further processed using Skyline software for parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) validation. The target proteins were sorted by their characteristics and applied to receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used as an indicator of the model's predictive ability, with values ranging from 0.5 to 1. Partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) was performed using SIMCA software, and proteins with a variable importance in projection (VIP) greater than 1 were considered meaningful for sample discrimination. Leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation was applied to select candidate biomarkers, and logistic regression was chosen as the classifier with specific parameters to ensure balanced classification.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the number of parameters used in the model varied depending on the specific analysis being conducted. For the machine learning-random forest experiment, the target proteins in the two comparison groups were sorted by their characteristics and then selected for the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used as an intuitive indicator of the model's predictive ability, with values ranging from 0.5 to 1.\n\nFor the partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA), proteins with a predictive variable importance in projection (VIP pred) larger than 1 were considered meaningful for sample discrimination. This step helped in selecting the most relevant parameters for the model.\n\nAdditionally, leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation was applied to select candidate biomarkers, ensuring that the model's performance was robust and generalizable. The samples were trained and evaluated in a leave-one-out manner using the scikit-learn Python package. Logistic regression was chosen as the classifier with specific solver and class weight parameters to handle the data effectively.\n\nThe selection of parameters was guided by the need to achieve a balance between model complexity and predictive performance. The use of ROC analysis, VIP scores, and LOO cross-validation helped in identifying the most relevant proteins and ensuring that the model was both accurate and reliable.",
  "optimization/features": "In the optimization process, the input features were derived from the characteristics of target proteins in two comparison groups. Feature selection was performed using the training set only. The proteins were sorted by their characteristics and then selected and applied to the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used as an intuitive indicator of the model's predictive ability. Additionally, partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) was employed using SIMCA software, where proteins with a predictive variable importance in projection (VIP pred) larger than 1 were considered meaningful for sample discrimination. Further leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation was applied to select candidate biomarkers. The samples were trained and evaluated in a leave-one-out manner using the scikit-learn Python package. Logistic regression was chosen as the classifier with solver = 'liblinear' and class weight = 'balanced'. The number of features used as input is not explicitly stated, but the process involved selecting proteins based on their characteristics and their importance in projection, ensuring that only the most relevant features were used in the model.",

Additionally, the partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) was conducted using SIMCA software, version 14.0, where proteins with a predictive variable importance in projection (VIP pred) greater than 1 were considered meaningful for sample discrimination.\n\nThe leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation method was applied using the scikit-learn Python package to select candidate biomarkers. The ROC analysis details, including the area under the curve (AUC) values, are also discussed, highlighting the model's predictive ability.\n\nRegarding the availability of model files and optimization parameters, the relative data are available upon request from the corresponding authors.

  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a black box. It utilizes machine learning techniques that provide interpretability through various means. For instance, the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis and the area under the curve (AUC) values offer clear insights into the model's predictive performance. An AUC value closer to 1 indicates a better classifier, making it easy to understand the model's effectiveness.\n\nAdditionally, the use of partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) with variable importance in projection (VIP) scores greater than 1 helps identify proteins that are meaningful for sample discrimination. This approach allows for the selection of candidate biomarkers in a transparent manner.\n\nThe leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation method further enhances the interpretability by evaluating the model's performance in a systematic way, ensuring that each sample is used for both training and validation. This process provides a clear understanding of how well the model generalizes to new data.\n\nMoreover, the logistic regression classifier used in the study, with specified parameters like 'solver = 'liblinear'' and 'class weight = 'balanced'', offers transparency in how the model makes predictions. The coefficients of the logistic regression model can be examined to understand the contribution of each feature to the final prediction.\n\nIn summary, the model's interpretability is achieved through the use of ROC analysis, AUC values, PLS-DA with VIP scores, LOO cross-validation, and the transparency of the logistic regression classifier. These methods collectively ensure that the model's decisions are understandable and can be justified based on the data.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in our study is primarily used for classification tasks. We utilized machine learning techniques, specifically logistic regression, to distinguish between different groups, such as tumor versus normal tissues and patients with lymph node metastases (N1) versus those without (N0). The logistic regression classifier was configured with the solver 'liblinear' and class weight 'balanced' to handle the classification effectively.\n\nThe performance of the model was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The AUC values for the top-performing proteins in distinguishing between tumor and normal tissues were greater than 0.9, indicating strong predictive ability. For example, proteins such as PDLIM4, ANXA1, PKM, NPC2, and LMNA showed excellent discriminatory power.\n\nAdditionally, we constructed a nomogram using a set of five proteins (FN1, IDH2, VDAC1, FABP4, and TG) to predict the prognosis of thyroid cancer patients. The nomogram's predictive accuracy was assessed using the concordance index (C-index), which was found to be 0.685, suggesting good predictive performance.\n\nOverall, the model's output is focused on classification and prediction, providing valuable insights into the diagnostic and prognostic markers for papillary thyroid microcarcinoma.",

Leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation was applied to select candidate biomarkers, ensuring that each sample was used once as a validation set while the remaining samples formed the training set.\n\nLogistic regression was chosen as the classifier, with specific parameters set to 'solver = 'liblinear'' and 'class weight = 'balanced''. This approach helped in evaluating the predictive power of the validated proteins in distinguishing between different conditions, such as tumor versus normal nodules and patients with versus without lymph node metastases.\n\nAdditionally, the prognostic validity of the model was assessed using mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data and corresponding clinical information from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Cox regression and the Kaplan\u2013Meier method were applied to analyze the association between target proteins, clinicopathologic features, and prognosis. A nomogram was generated using the RMS package, and its discriminant ability was determined using the concordance index (C-index). Calibration curves were evaluated to map the probabilities predicted by the nomogram to the observed occurrences.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our study, several performance metrics were reported to assess the predictive power of the identified biomarkers. For distinguishing between tumor and normal nodules, the area under the curve (AUC) was used as a primary metric. The AUC values for the top five proteins\u2014PDLIM4, ANXA1, PKM, NPC2, and LMNA\u2014were all greater than 0.9, indicating excellent predictive performance. Additionally, a combination of PDLIM4 and ANXA1 achieved an AUC of 1.00, demonstrating perfect discrimination between benign and malignant nodules.\n\nFor predicting lymph node metastases, the AUC for FN1 was reported as 0.690, suggesting a moderate level of predictive accuracy. This metric is commonly used in the literature to evaluate the performance of biomarkers in distinguishing between different clinical outcomes.\n\nFurthermore, the prognostic value of the identified proteins was evaluated using the concordance index (C-index) for a nomogram constructed from five proteins: FN1, IDH2, VDAC1, FABP4, and TG. The C-index of the nomogram was 0.685, with a confidence interval of 0.645\u20130.726, indicating good predictive accuracy for patient prognosis. This set of metrics is representative of those commonly used in similar studies, providing a comprehensive evaluation of both diagnostic and prognostic performance.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "Not applicable.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our study included several statistical analyses to ensure the reliability and significance of our findings. We used a confidence value greater than 0.4 to extract interaction relationships, indicating a robust threshold for identifying meaningful interactions.\n\nIn our machine learning experiments, we employed receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis to assess the predictive ability of our models. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used as a key metric, with values ranging from 0.5 to 1. An AUC close to 1 indicates excellent predictive performance. We also performed partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) using SIMCA software, where proteins with a variable importance in projection (VIP) greater than 1 were considered significant for sample discrimination.\n\nTo further validate our results, we applied leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation. This method ensures that each sample is used once as a validation set while the remaining samples form the training set, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance. Logistic regression was chosen as the classifier, with specific parameters set to balance the class weights.\n\nFor prognostic validity, we used Cox regression and the Kaplan\u2013Meier method to analyze the association between target proteins, clinicopathologic features, and prognosis. The concordance index (C-index) was used to determine the discriminant ability of the nomogram, providing a measure of the model's predictive accuracy.\n\nStatistical significance was assessed using P-values, with one asterisk indicating P < 0.05\u20130.01 and two asterisks indicating P < 0.01\u20130.001. These values help to confirm that the observed differences in protein expression are not due to random chance.\n\nOverall, our evaluation methods included robust statistical analyses and cross-validation techniques to ensure the reliability and significance of our findings. The performance metrics, such as AUC and VIP, along with statistical significance tests, provide strong evidence supporting the superiority of our method.",
