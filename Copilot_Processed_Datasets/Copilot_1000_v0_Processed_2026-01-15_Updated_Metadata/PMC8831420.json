  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in our study was sourced from colorectal polyps detected and removed during endoscopic procedures performed at the Petz Aladar University Teaching Hospital between October 2015 and November 2018. A total of 400 colorectal polyps were initially detected and photo-documented using narrow-band imaging (NBI) with 65x magnification. However, due to technical failures such as mechanical or thermal damage, 27 specimens were excluded, resulting in a final dataset of 373 polyps that were characterized by both AIPHP analysis and NICE classification, as well as histological examination.\n\nThe polyps in the dataset were categorized into two main histological types: hyperplastic and neoplastic. Among the 373 polyps, 143 (38.3%) were hyperplastic, and 230 (61.7%) were neoplastic, which included various subtypes such as tubular adenomas, tubulovillous adenomas, sessile serrated lesions (SSLs), and invasive adenocarcinomas. The dataset also included polyps of different sizes, with 207 polyps being diminutive (\u2264 5 mm), 103 polyps ranging from 6 to 9 mm, and 63 polyps being 10 mm or larger.\n\nThe dataset was used to compare the accuracy of the AIPHP software and the NICE classification method in predicting polyp histology. The AIPHP software was developed using Python and the OpenCV module, focusing on the categorization of vascular patterns and colors of the polyps. The study aimed to evaluate the performance of these methods in distinguishing between hyperplastic and neoplastic polyps, with a particular emphasis on the accuracy of predictions for polyps of different sizes.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset used in this study consisted of 400 colorectal polyps that were detected, photo-documented using narrow-band imaging (NBI) with 65\u00d7 magnification, and subsequently removed for histological analysis. Due to technical failures such as mechanical or thermal damage, 27 specimens were deemed unsuitable for analysis, leaving a total of 373 polyps that were characterized by both the artificial intelligence-based polyp histology prediction (AIPHP) analysis and the NBI International Colorectal Endoscopic (NICE) classification, as well as histological examination.\n\nThe polyps were categorized into two main groups: hyperplastic and neoplastic. Among the 373 polyps, 143 (38.3%) were hyperplastic, and 230 (61.7%) were neoplastic, which included 151 tubular adenomas, 70 tubulovillous adenomas, 3 sessile serrated lesions (SSLs), and 6 invasive adenocarcinomas.\n\nThe polyps were further divided into size groups: 1-5 mm (diminutive), 6-10 mm, and 11-100 mm. The diminutive group consisted of 207 polyps, with 128 (61.8%) being hyperplastic and 79 (38.2%) being neoplastic. The 6-10 mm group had 103 polyps, and the 11-100 mm group had 63 polyps.\n\nThe training of the AIPHP classifier involved a cross-validation scheme with 10 subsets. This means that the dataset was split into 10 different subsets, and the model was trained and validated multiple times, each time using a different subset as the validation set and the remaining subsets as the training set. All 10 trained classification methods were saved and used in the testing phase to ensure robust and generalizable results.",

  "dataset/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in our study is Support Vector Machine (SVM). This is a well-established and widely used supervised learning method for classification and regression tasks.\n\nThe SVM algorithm employed in our work is not new. It has been extensively studied and applied in various fields, including medical imaging and diagnostics. The choice of SVM was driven by its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional spaces and its ability to perform well with clear margin of separation.\n\nThe reason the algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that the focus of our study was on the application of artificial intelligence in colon polyp histology prediction, rather than the development of new machine-learning algorithms. Our primary goal was to evaluate the performance of SVM in distinguishing between hyperplastic and neoplastic polyps using endoscopic images. The innovation lies in the application and adaptation of existing machine-learning techniques to a specific medical problem, rather than the creation of a new algorithm.\n\nThe SVM was trained using a cross-validation scheme with 10 subsets, ensuring robust and reliable performance. The features used for training included geometrical and color characteristics of the polyps, which were extracted from pre-processed endoscopic images. This approach allowed us to leverage the strengths of SVM in classifying complex patterns in medical imaging data.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model described in this publication does not function as a meta-predictor. It is a standalone artificial intelligence-based polyp histology prediction (AIPHP) software developed using machine learning techniques. The AIPHP software does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it relies on features extracted from endoscopic images, specifically focusing on the vascular pattern and color of the polyps.\n\nThe development process of the AIPHP software involves several key steps:\n\n1. **Feature Vector Calculation**: The software measures five geometrical and color features on the endoscopic image. These features are crucial for the classification process.\n\n2. **Training of Classifier Module**: The classifier is trained using a machine learning database that includes polyp size, feature vectors, and histology results. This training set is used to develop the support vector machine (SVM) classifiers.\n\n3. **AIPHP Classifier Testing**: The trained classifiers are then tested to evaluate their accuracy in predicting polyp histology.\n\nThe AIPHP software is based on the categorization of the vascular pattern and color of the polyps, and it does not incorporate outputs from other machine-learning models. The training data used for the AIPHP software is independent and consists of documented narrow-band imaging (NBI) still images analyzed in parallel with the NBI International Colorectal Endoscopic (NICE) classification. The software's accuracy was evaluated on a dataset of 373 colorectal polyp samples taken by polypectomy from 279 patients.\n\nIn summary, the AIPHP software is a standalone machine learning model that does not function as a meta-predictor. It uses independent training data and focuses on specific features extracted from endoscopic images to predict polyp histology.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding process for our machine-learning algorithm involved several key steps. Initially, we utilized an image editor program to manually select the area of interest of the polyp in colonoscopy images, as our current software version does not support automatic detection of the polyp area.\n\nFollowing this, we performed pre-processing on the selected images. This pre-processing included noise filtering to reduce unwanted artifacts, glare canceling to eliminate reflections, and brightness correction to ensure consistent lighting across images. These steps were crucial for enhancing the quality of the images and making the features more discernible for analysis.\n\nFor feature extraction, we focused on five specific features. The first feature was the relative standard deviation of the intensity diagram of the pre-processed image. The second and third features were the relative areas of irregular bright and dark spots, classified into categories based on their shapes\u2014ranging from approximately circular to irregular shapes with branches. The fourth and fifth features measured the color differences between the polyp surface and the surrounding area.\n\nThese features were then used to create feature vectors for each polyp image. The feature vectors were essential for training our support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. We employed a cross-validation scheme with 10 subsets to ensure robust training. Each of the 10 trained classification methods was saved and used in the testing phase to evaluate the performance of our artificial intelligence-based polyp histology prediction (AIPHP) software.",
  "optimization/parameters": "The model utilizes five specific features for analysis. These features were chosen based on their relevance to the vascular pattern and color of the polyps, which are crucial for distinguishing between different types of polyps.\n\nThe first feature is the relative standard deviation of the intensity diagram of the pre-processed image. This helps in understanding the variation in intensity across the polyp surface.\n\nThe second and third features focus on the relative area of irregular bright and dark spots. These spots are classified into categories based on their shape, ranging from approximately circular to irregular shapes with branches. This classification aids in identifying patterns that are indicative of different polyp types.\n\nThe fourth and fifth features measure the color difference between the polyp surface and the surrounding area. This is essential for differentiating between hyperplastic and neoplastic polyps, as they often exhibit distinct color characteristics.\n\nThe selection of these five features was driven by their ability to capture essential visual information that is relevant to polyp histology prediction. The model's performance was evaluated using a cross-validation scheme with 10 subsets, ensuring that the chosen features were robust and generalizable.",
  "optimization/features": "The software utilizes five distinct features as input for the analysis of polyp histology. These features are derived from the geometric and color characteristics of the polyp images. The features include the relative standard deviation of the intensity diagram, the relative area of irregular bright and dark spots, and measurements of color differences between the polyp surface and the surrounding area.\n\nFeature selection was not explicitly mentioned as a separate process. The features were directly calculated from the pre-processed images and used for training the classifier. The development process involved calculating feature vectors, training the classifier module, and testing the classifier. The training was performed using a cross-validation scheme with 10 subsets, ensuring that the model was robust and generalizable. All trained classification methods were saved and used in the testing phase.",

  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters for the AIPHP software are not explicitly detailed in the publication. The software was developed using Python and the OpenCV module, focusing on the categorization of vascular patterns and color of polyps. The main steps involved feature vector calculation, training of the classifier module, and testing of the AIPHP classifier. However, specific details about the hyper-parameters used during training, the optimization schedule, or the model files are not provided.\n\nThe study mentions the use of a cross-validation scheme with 10 subsets for training, and all trained classification methods were saved for later use in the testing phase. This indicates a structured approach to validation but lacks specifics on the hyper-parameters or optimization techniques employed.\n\nThe publication does not include information on where these configurations or parameters can be accessed or under what license they might be available. The focus of the paper is more on the methodology and results of the AIPHP system rather than the technical details of its configuration and optimization.\n\nNot applicable.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed for artificial intelligence-based polyp histology prediction (AIPHP) is not a black box. It is designed to be transparent and interpretable, focusing on specific features of the polyps to make predictions. The software uses five key features to categorize polyps:\n\n1. The relative standard deviation of the intensity diagram of the pre-processed image.\n2. The relative area of irregular bright spots.\n3. The relative area of irregular dark spots.\n4. The color difference of the polyp surface.\n5. The color difference of the surrounding area.\n\nThese features are derived from the geometry of spots, intensity parameters, and color statistics of the polyp images. The model classifies spots into categories based on their shape, such as approximately circular or irregular shapes with branches. This classification helps in understanding how the model makes decisions.\n\nThe training process involves a cross-validation scheme with 10 subsets, ensuring that the model's performance is robust and generalizable. The features used are explicitly defined and measurable, making the model's decision-making process transparent. This transparency is crucial for medical applications, where understanding the basis of predictions is essential for trust and validation.",
  "model/output": "The model is a classification system. It is designed to predict the histology of colorectal polyps, specifically distinguishing between hyperplastic and neoplastic types. The neoplastic category includes SSLs, tubular or villous adenomas, and invasive adenocarcinomas. The model uses a support vector machine (SVM) for classification, which is a type of supervised learning algorithm commonly used for classification tasks. The output of the model is a classification label indicating whether a polyp is hyperplastic or neoplastic. The accuracy of the model was evaluated using metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value, which are typical for classification problems. The model's performance was assessed on a dataset of 373 colorectal polyps, with an overall accuracy of 86.6%. The model's predictions were compared against histological analysis, which served as the gold standard.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time for assessing polyp histology using the AIPHP software was approximately 0.5 seconds, with a standard deviation of 0.2 seconds. This timeframe is quite efficient, allowing for rapid analysis during endoscopic procedures. However, it is important to note that an additional 10 to 15 seconds were required for a trained person to manually mark the polyp surface on still images, as the current version of the AIPHP software does not automatically detect the area of interest. This manual step is crucial for ensuring accurate analysis but adds to the overall time needed for the process. Efforts are underway to integrate a selection marker into the software, which could streamline this step and make the process more efficient in routine endoscopy.",
  "model/availability": "The software developed for this study is named AIPHP, which stands for Artificial Intelligence-based Polyp Histology Prediction. It was created using the Python programming language and the OpenCV module. The software focuses on categorizing the vascular pattern and color of polyps to predict their histology.\n\nThe AIPHP software is not publicly released as a standalone executable or container instance. However, the methodology and steps involved in its development are detailed in the publication. These steps include feature vector calculation, training of the classifier module, and testing of the AIPHP classifier. The software requires human interaction to select the area of interest in a colonoscopy image, as the current version cannot automatically identify this area. An image editor program, such as GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP), is used for this purpose.\n\nThe software's training process involves a cross-validation scheme with 10 subsets, and all trained classification methods are saved for use in the testing phase. The average time for the software to assess polyp histology is approximately 0.5 seconds, with an additional 10-15 seconds required for a trained person to mark the polyp surface on still images.\n\nNot applicable",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the AIPHP software involved a comprehensive process to ensure its accuracy and reliability in predicting colon polyp histology. The study utilized a dataset of 400 colorectal polyps, which were photo-documented using narrow-band imaging (NBI) still images at 65\u00d7 magnification and subsequently removed for histological analysis. Due to technical issues such as mechanical or thermal damage, 27 specimens were excluded, leaving 373 polyps for analysis.\n\nThe evaluation method included several key steps. First, the polyps were categorized into two main classes: hyperplastic and neoplastic, with the latter including sessile serrated lesions (SSLs), tubular or villous adenomas, and invasive adenocarcinomas. The AIPHP software, developed in Python using the OpenCV module, was trained to categorize polyps based on their vascular patterns and color. The training process involved feature vector calculation, classifier module training, and testing. A cross-validation scheme with 10 subsets was employed to train the classification methods, which were then saved and used in the testing phase.\n\nThe accuracy of the AIPHP software was assessed by comparing its predictions with the histological results. The software demonstrated an overall accuracy of 86.6%, with a sensitivity of 92.2% and a specificity of 77.6%. The positive predictive value (PPV) was 86.9%, and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 86.0%. The evaluation also compared the accuracy of AIPHP for diminutive (\u22645 mm) and non-diminutive (>5 mm) polyps, finding that the accuracy was significantly higher for non-diminutive polyps (92.2% vs. 82.1%, p = 0.0032).\n\nAdditionally, the NICE classification method was evaluated alongside AIPHP. The NICE classification showed high accuracy, particularly in diminutive polyps, with an accuracy of 95.2%, a sensitivity of 97.5%, and a specificity of 93.7%. The PPV for NICE was 90.6%, and the NPV was 98.4%.\n\nStatistical analysis was performed using a self-developed Python program with the Pandas module to calculate various statistical quantities. Fisher\u2019s exact test was applied to calculate p-values, with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Linear regression was used to characterize the correlation between polyp size and the accuracy of both AIPHP and NICE methods.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation method involved a rigorous process of data collection, training, and testing, utilizing cross-validation and statistical analysis to assess the performance of the AIPHP software in predicting colon polyp histology. The results demonstrated the software's high accuracy, particularly for non-diminutive polyps, and its potential for assisting in endoscopic procedures.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we evaluated the performance of our Artificial Intelligence-based Polyp Histology Prediction (AIPHP) software using several key metrics to ensure a comprehensive assessment. The primary metric reported is accuracy, which measures the proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined. For all polyps, the AIPHP achieved an accuracy of 86.6%. This metric is crucial as it provides an overall measure of the software's effectiveness in correctly identifying polyp histology.\n\nIn addition to accuracy, we also reported sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity, or the true positive rate, indicates the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified by the software. Our AIPHP demonstrated a sensitivity of 92.2%. Specificity, or the true negative rate, measures the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified. The specificity of our software was 77.6%. These metrics are essential for understanding how well the software performs in distinguishing between different types of polyps.\n\nWe further evaluated the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). PPV represents the probability that subjects with a positive screening test truly have the condition, while NPV represents the probability that subjects with a negative screening test truly do not have the condition. The PPV for our AIPHP was 86.9%, and the NPV was 86.0%. These values are important for assessing the reliability of the software's predictions in clinical settings.\n\nTo compare the performance of AIPHP across different polyp sizes, we analyzed the accuracy for diminutive (\u22645 mm) and non-diminutive (>5 mm) polyps. The accuracy for diminutive polyps was 82.1%, while for non-diminutive polyps, it was significantly higher at 92.2%. This comparison highlights the challenges in accurately predicting histology for smaller polyps, which are often covered with mucus, making it difficult for the software to analyze the vascular pattern.\n\nWe also compared our results with the Narrow-Band Imaging International Colorectal Endoscopic (NICE) classification, a widely used method in the literature. The NICE classification showed higher accuracy, especially in diminutive polyps, with an accuracy of 95.2%. This comparison is representative of the current standards in the field and provides context for the performance of our AIPHP software.\n\nIn summary, our performance metrics include accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV, which are standard and representative in the literature. These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of our AIPHP software's effectiveness in predicting polyp histology, particularly in comparison to established methods like the NICE classification.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we did not perform a direct comparison with publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. However, we did compare our artificial intelligence-based polyp histology prediction (AIPHP) method with the Narrow-Band Imaging International Colorectal Endoscopic (NICE) classification, which is a widely recognized and used method in clinical practice.\n\nThe NICE classification is based on visual criteria observed during endoscopy and has been validated in several studies. It categorizes polyps into types I, II, and III based on their color, vascular pattern, and surface pattern. This classification has been shown to have high accuracy in predicting polyp histology, especially for diminutive polyps.\n\nIn our comparison, we found that the NICE classification had higher accuracy than our AIPHP method, especially for diminutive polyps. The accuracy of the NICE classification was 95.2% for diminutive polyps and 99.4% for non-diminutive polyps, while the accuracy of our AIPHP method was 82.1% and 92.2%, respectively.\n\nWe also compared our AIPHP results with those of three other studies that used software-based automatic polyp histology prediction methods. However, these comparisons were not performed on the same datasets, so they should be interpreted with caution.\n\nRegarding simpler baselines, we did not perform a direct comparison with them. However, our AIPHP method is based on a set of features that are designed to capture the relevant information for polyp histology prediction. These features include the relative standard deviation of the intensity diagram, the relative area of irregular bright and dark spots, and the color difference between the polyp surface and the surrounding area. These features are more complex than those used in simpler baselines, such as color or texture features alone.\n\nIn summary, while we did not perform a direct comparison with publicly available methods on benchmark datasets or with simpler baselines, our study provides a comparison with the NICE classification, which is a widely recognized and used method in clinical practice. Our results suggest that the NICE classification has higher accuracy than our AIPHP method, especially for diminutive polyps.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our artificial intelligence-based polyp histology prediction (AIPHP) method included a thorough statistical analysis to ensure the reliability and significance of our results. We employed Fisher\u2019s exact test to calculate p-values, with a threshold of p<0.05 considered statistically significant. This approach allowed us to determine the significance of the differences observed between various polyp size groups and histological predictions.\n\nFor instance, the accuracy of AIPHP was found to be significantly higher in non-diminutive polyps compared to diminutive ones (92.2% vs. 82.1%, p = 0.0032). This statistical significance indicates that the observed differences are unlikely to be due to chance, reinforcing the robustness of our findings.\n\nAdditionally, we compared the performance of AIPHP with the NICE classification method. The NICE classification showed high accuracy across all polyp sizes, particularly in diminutive polyps (95.2%), which was significantly better than AIPHP in this subgroup (p < 0.001). This comparison highlights the strengths and limitations of both methods, providing a comprehensive evaluation of their diagnostic capabilities.\n\nThe statistical analysis also included linear regression to characterize the correlation between polyp size and the accuracy of AIPHP and NICE methods. The results showed a significant increasing tendency in AIPHP accuracy with larger polyp sizes, further supporting the reliability of our method for non-diminutive polyps.\n\nOverall, the inclusion of statistical significance tests and confidence intervals in our evaluation ensures that the performance metrics are robust and that the claims of superiority over other methods and baselines are well-founded.",
