  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study is derived from patients with primary cutaneous melanoma (CM) tumors. The development cohort consists of 1,398 patients aged 18 years or older, with known Breslow thickness (T1-T4), a continuous 31-gene expression profile (31-GEP) test result, and either clinically or pathologically known sentinel lymph node (SLN) status. This cohort has been previously described in another study.\n\nThe validation cohort includes 1,674 patients with a continuous 31-GEP test result, enrolled under three Western Institutional Review Board\u2013approved studies from 25 surgical and five dermatologic centers. The eligibility criteria for the validation cohort were the same as for the development cohort.\n\nThe data collected for analysis and algorithm training included continuous variables such as the 31-GEP score, Breslow thickness, mitotic rate (MR), and age, as well as categorical variables like ulceration status, regression, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), sex, microsatellites, histopathologic subtype, transected bases, and tumor site. The 31-GEP test was performed in a College of American Pathologists\u2013accredited and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments\u2013certified laboratory.\n\nThe dataset has not been made publicly available.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was split into three main parts: the development cohort, the training cohort, and the validation cohort.\n\nThe development cohort consisted of 1,398 data points. This cohort was previously described by Vetto et al. It included patients aged 18 years or older, with known Breslow thickness, clinical or pathologic sentinel lymph node (SLN) status, and a valid continuous 31-gene expression profile (31-GEP) score.\n\nThe training cohort was derived from the development cohort. It underwent feature selection based on variable completeness and relevance. The training process involved 4\u00d710-fold hyperparameter tuning and neural network model development.\n\nThe validation cohort consisted of 1,674 data points. This cohort was drawn from three studies with retrospective or prospective enrollment from 30 participating centers. Similar to the development cohort, it included patients aged 18 years or older, with known Breslow thickness, clinical or pathologic SLN status, and a valid continuous 31-GEP score.\n\nAdditionally, there was a long-term outcomes cohort consisting of 312 data points. This cohort was used to assess the long-term outcomes of the patients.\n\nThe distribution of data points in each split was as follows:\n\n* Development cohort: 1,398 data points\n* Training cohort: Derived from the development cohort (specific number not provided)\n* Validation cohort: 1,674 data points\n* Long-term outcomes cohort: 312 data points",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets were split into a development cohort and an independent validation cohort. The development cohort consisted of 1,398 patients aged 18 years or older with primary cutaneous melanoma (CM) tumors of known Breslow thickness (T1-T4), a continuous 31-gene expression profile (31-GEP) test result, and either clinically or pathologically known sentinel lymph node (SLN) status. The validation cohort included 1,674 patients with similar eligibility criteria, enrolled under three different studies from 30 participating centers.\n\nThe training and test sets are independent. The development cohort was used for training the model, while the validation cohort was used to independently validate the model's performance. This independence was enforced by ensuring that the validation cohort was collected from separate studies and centers, distinct from those in the development cohort.\n\nThe distribution of the datasets compares favorably to previously published machine learning datasets in melanoma research. The datasets include a comprehensive range of clinicopathologic features and molecular data, which are crucial for developing and validating predictive models. The inclusion of continuous variables such as 31-GEP score, Breslow thickness, mitotic rate, and age, along with categorical variables like ulceration status, regression, lymphovascular invasion, and histologic subtype, ensures a robust and diverse dataset. This approach aligns with best practices in machine learning for medical research, aiming to reduce overfitting and enhance the generalizability of the model.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data used in this study will not be made publicly available. The i31-GEP algorithm incorporates data from the continuous output of the 31-gene expression profile test, which assesses 28 discriminating gene targets and three control genes via qRT-PCR. Additionally, the algorithm includes clinicopathologic variables such as continuous Breslow thickness, mitotic rate, age, and binary ulceration status. The decision to keep the data private ensures the protection of patient information and maintains the proprietary nature of the neural network algorithm developed for this study.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used is a neural network. This type of algorithm is well-suited for handling complex, non-linear relationships in data, making it appropriate for integrating various clinicopathologic features and gene expression profiles to predict sentinel lymph node positivity.\n\nThe specific neural network algorithm employed is proprietary and has been developed for this particular application. It incorporates data from a 31-gene expression profile test, which assesses 28 discriminating gene targets and three control genes via qRT-PCR using a radial basis machine algorithm. This neural network is designed to handle the continuous output of the gene expression profile test and clinicopathologic variables, including Breslow thickness, mitotic rate, age, and ulceration status.\n\nThe decision to use a neural network was driven by the need to overcome the limitations of previously published models for sentinel lymph node positivity prediction. These models often relied on simple logistic regression, focused on biased patient populations, or did not incorporate molecular tumor data. By integrating advanced artificial intelligence techniques, the neural network algorithm aims to provide a more individualized and accurate risk assessment for sentinel lymph node positivity.\n\nThe algorithm was developed and validated through a rigorous process involving feature selection based on variable completeness and relevance, 4\u00d7 10-fold hyperparameter tuning, and neural network model development. This approach ensures that the model is robust and generalizable to different patient populations.\n\nThe proprietary nature of the neural network algorithm means that it was not published in a machine-learning journal. Instead, it was developed and validated within the context of clinical research to address specific medical needs. The focus was on applying machine learning to improve personalized medicine for patients with melanoma, rather than on the theoretical contributions to the field of machine learning.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model described in this publication is not a meta-predictor. It does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it is a neural network algorithm that integrates the continuous 31-gene expression profile (31-GEP) score with various clinicopathologic features. These features include Breslow thickness, mitotic rate, age, and ulceration status, among others. The algorithm was developed using a training cohort and independently validated using a separate cohort, ensuring that the training data is independent from the validation data. The neural network model was trained through feature selection based on variable completeness and relevance, followed by hyperparameter tuning. This approach aims to predict sentinel lymph node (SLN) positivity risk in patients with T1-T4 cutaneous melanoma, providing a more individualized and precise risk assessment.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure the variables were appropriately formatted and handled. Variables such as regression, mitotic rate, microsatellites, and ulceration were imputed as absent if they were not reported in the patient records. For mitotic rate, if it was reported qualitatively as present, it was set to one. If it was reported with a specific symbol preceding the number of mitoses, it was adjusted accordingly. If the mitotic rate or Breslow thickness exceeded certain thresholds, they were imputed to those thresholds. Variables that occurred in less than 5% of cases or had insufficient completeness due to nonstandardized reporting were excluded from the algorithm training. The neural network model was developed using feature selection based on variable completeness and relevance, followed by 4\u00d7 10-fold hyperparameter tuning. The final model integrated the continuous 31-gene expression profile score with clinicopathologic features to predict sentinel lymph node positivity risk.",
  "optimization/parameters": "The model utilized several input parameters for its development. Initially, a wide range of variables were considered, including Breslow thickness, ulceration, 31-gene expression profile, regression, mitotic rate, microsatellites, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, transected base, age, sex, histologic subtype, and tumor location.\n\nTo prevent overfitting and ensure the model's robustness, variable selection was crucial. Variables that occurred in less than 5% of cases, such as microsatellites and lymphovascular invasion, were excluded. Additionally, variables with insufficient completeness due to nonstandardized reporting, like tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, were also excluded.\n\nThe final model incorporated the continuous variables 31-gene expression profile, Breslow thickness, mitotic rate, and age, along with the binary variable ulceration. These variables were selected based on their completeness and relevance to the model.\n\nThe selection process involved feature selection on the basis of variable completeness and relevance, followed by 4\u00d7 10-fold hyperparameter tuning. This rigorous approach ensured that the most significant variables were included in the model, enhancing its predictive accuracy.",
  "optimization/features": "The input features for the algorithm include both continuous and categorical variables. The continuous variables considered are the 31-gene expression profile (31-GEP) score, Breslow thickness, mitotic rate (MR), and age. The categorical variables include ulceration status, regression, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), presence or absence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), sex, microsatellites, histopathologic subtype, transected base, and tumor site.\n\nFeature selection was performed to ensure that only relevant variables were included in the algorithm. Variables that occurred in less than 5% of cases or had insufficient completeness due to nonstandardized reporting were excluded. For instance, microsatellites and lymphovascular invasion, which occurred in less than 5% of cases, were excluded. Additionally, variables like histologic subtype, transected base, tumor location, and sex did not improve the model fit and were thus excluded from the final algorithm.\n\nThe feature selection process was conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the validation set remained independent and unbiased. This approach helps in preventing overfitting and ensures that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study utilized a neural network model, which is known for its ability to capture complex relationships within data. The number of parameters in the neural network was indeed larger than the number of training points, a scenario that can lead to overfitting if not properly managed.\n\nTo mitigate overfitting, several strategies were implemented. First, variable selection was performed to exclude variables that occurred in less than 5% of cases or had insufficient completeness due to nonstandardized reporting. This step ensured that only relevant and well-reported variables were included in the model. Second, four times ten-fold cross-validation was used for hyperparameter tuning. This technique helps in selecting the optimal hyperparameters by evaluating the model's performance on multiple subsets of the data, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting. Additionally, multiple iterations of the model were run with the remaining features to determine which features provided the most accurate algorithm without overfitting.\n\nTo address underfitting, the model was developed using a comprehensive set of variables, including both continuous and categorical features. The continuous variables considered were 31-GEP score, Breslow thickness, mitotic rate, and age, while the categorical variables included ulceration status, regression, lymphovascular invasion, presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, sex, microsatellites, histopathologic subtype, transected bases, and tumor site. This extensive feature set allowed the model to capture a wide range of patterns in the data, reducing the likelihood of underfitting. Furthermore, the use of neural networks, which are capable of learning complex non-linear relationships, helped in ensuring that the model could adequately fit the data without being too simplistic.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In the development of our neural network algorithm, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting. One of the primary methods involved careful variable selection. We excluded variables that occurred in less than 5% of cases, such as microsatellites and lymphovascular invasion, as well as those with insufficient completeness due to nonstandardized reporting, like tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. This step ensured that only relevant and well-reported variables were included in the model, reducing the risk of overfitting to noise or irrelevant data.\n\nAdditionally, we performed hyperparameter tuning using a 4\u00d710-fold cross-validation approach. This method helps in selecting the optimal hyperparameters that generalize well to unseen data, further mitigating the risk of overfitting. By systematically evaluating different hyperparameter settings, we aimed to find a balance that maximizes the model's performance on both training and validation datasets.\n\nMoreover, we capped certain variables, such as mitotic rate and Breslow thickness, at a maximum value of 10. This normalization technique helps in preventing any single variable from dominating the model's predictions, thereby promoting a more balanced and generalizable model.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization schedule used in the development of the i31-GEP algorithm are not explicitly detailed in the available information. The process involved feature selection based on variable completeness and relevance, followed by 4\u00d7 10-fold hyperparameter tuning. However, the specific hyper-parameters and their values are not provided.\n\nThe model files and optimization parameters are also not made publicly available. The data used for training and validation, including the continuous 31-gene expression profile scores and clinicopathologic variables, are proprietary and not shared publicly. This includes details about the neural network architecture and the specific parameters that were optimized during the training process.\n\nGiven the proprietary nature of the algorithm and the data, it is not possible to provide access to the model files or the exact optimization parameters. The focus of the study is on the integration of the 31-GEP score with clinicopathologic features to predict sentinel lymph node positivity, rather than on the detailed technical specifications of the model.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in this study is not entirely transparent and can be considered somewhat of a black box. The i31-GEP algorithm employs a proprietary neural network, which inherently lacks interpretability due to its complex, multi-layered structure. Neural networks are known for their ability to capture intricate patterns in data, but this comes at the cost of transparency, making it challenging to trace the exact decision-making process.\n\nHowever, efforts were made to incorporate interpretable variables into the model. The algorithm considers several clinicopathologic features, including Breslow thickness, mitotic rate, age, and ulceration status, alongside the continuous output of the 31-gene expression profile test. These variables are well-established in the medical community and contribute to the model's interpretability to some extent.\n\nAdditionally, variable importance scores were calculated to understand the contribution of each feature. The 31-GEP had the highest importance score, indicating its significant role in predicting sentinel lymph node positivity. This provides some insight into the model's decision-making process, even though the exact inner workings of the neural network remain opaque.\n\nIn summary, while the i31-GEP algorithm leverages interpretable variables and provides variable importance scores, the use of a neural network means that the model is not fully transparent. The trade-off between complexity and interpretability is a common challenge in machine learning, and this study is no exception.",
  "model/output": "The model is a classification model. It predicts the likelihood of sentinel lymph node (SLN) positivity, categorizing patients into those with a likelihood of less than 5%, between 5% and 10%, and greater than 10%. The output of the model is used to classify patients into these risk categories, which helps in deciding whether a sentinel lymph node biopsy is necessary. The model's accuracy is assessed using metrics such as sensitivity and negative predictive value, which are typical for classification tasks.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the method involved several key steps to ensure its accuracy and reliability. Initially, the algorithm was trained on a development cohort consisting of 1,398 patients aged 18 years or older with primary cutaneous melanoma (CM) tumors of known Breslow thickness (T1-T4). These patients had a continuous 31-gene expression profile (31-GEP) test result and either clinically or pathologically known sentinel lymph node (SLN) status.\n\nTo develop the algorithm, feature selection was performed based on variable completeness and relevance. This was followed by 4\u00d710-fold hyperparameter tuning to optimize the neural network model. The neural network was generated using the caret package in R, specifically the nnet submodule, with four times ten-fold cross-validation for hyperparameter selection.\n\nThe algorithm's accuracy was assessed by assigning integrated 31-GEP predictions of SLN tumor involvement. A prediction of less than 5% was considered negative, while 5% or more was considered positive. The sentinel lymph node biopsy reduction rate was calculated by dividing the number of negative test results by the full population. The percent yield, or positive predictive value, was determined as the proportion of true positive test results among all test results.\n\nValidation of the algorithm was performed on an independent cohort of 1,674 patients from three studies with retrospective or prospective enrollment from 30 participating centers. This cohort also consisted of patients aged 18 years or older with known Breslow thickness, SLN status, and a valid continuous 31-GEP score.\n\nStatistical analysis was conducted using the Mann-Whitney U test, chi-square test, or Fisher\u2019s exact test for comparing clinicopathologic features between cohorts. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Continuous variables were reported as median (range), and dichotomous variables were reported as n (%). Simple logistic regression was performed to show the probability of a positive SLN for each variable within the training cohort. Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test were used to compare survival outcomes. The R statistical package v3.6.3 and Graphpad Prism v8.4.1 were used for statistical analysis.",
  "evaluation/measure": "To evaluate the performance of the integrated 31-GEP (i31-GEP) algorithm, several key metrics were reported. The overall sensitivity of the model was 95.1%, indicating a high true positive rate. The negative predictive value (NPV) was 98.1%, suggesting that when the model predicts a negative result, it is highly likely to be correct. This is particularly important for reducing unnecessary sentinel lymph node biopsies (SLNB).\n\nFor the T1a low-risk population, there were no pathologically positive sentinel lymph nodes, highlighting the model's effectiveness in this subgroup. In the T3 population, only one negative test result was observed, and the T4 population had no negative results, reinforcing the model's accuracy in higher-risk groups.\n\nIn the T1a-HR-T2 population, which is the group most likely to benefit from additional guidance, the i31-GEP demonstrated an overall high NPV of 97.4% and a sensitivity of 89.8%. This indicates a low false-negative rate, which is crucial for clinical decision-making.\n\nThe procedure reduction rate was also calculated by dividing the number of negative test results by the full population. This metric helps in assessing the potential reduction in unnecessary SLNB procedures, thereby minimizing associated risks and costs.\n\nThe reported metrics are representative of those commonly used in the literature for evaluating predictive models in medical diagnostics. Sensitivity, NPV, and procedure reduction rate are standard measures that provide a comprehensive view of the model's performance, particularly in the context of reducing unnecessary procedures while accurately identifying high-risk patients.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the i31-GEP algorithm demonstrates robust performance metrics, which are crucial for assessing its reliability and superiority over other methods. The algorithm's accuracy is quantified using sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV), both of which are essential for evaluating its effectiveness in predicting sentinel lymph node (SLN) positivity.\n\nThe overall sensitivity of the model is reported at 95.1%, indicating a high true positive rate. The NPV is 98.1%, suggesting that a negative test result from the i31-GEP algorithm is highly reliable in predicting the absence of SLN metastasis. These metrics are particularly significant in the T1a-HR-T2 population, where the algorithm shows an NPV of 97.4% and a sensitivity of 89.8%, underscoring its low false-negative rate.\n\nStatistical significance is addressed through various tests, including the Chi-square test, Fisher\u2019s exact test, and the Mann-Whitney U test. These tests are used to compare the training and validation cohorts, ensuring that the observed differences in performance metrics are not due to random chance. For instance, the presence of ulceration, mitotic rate, and other variables are analyzed using these statistical methods to confirm their relevance and impact on the algorithm's predictions.\n\nThe procedure reduction rate, calculated by dividing the number of negative test results by the full population, further supports the algorithm's effectiveness. This rate highlights the potential to reduce unnecessary sentinel lymph node biopsies, thereby decreasing morbidity, cost, and patient anxiety.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics of the i31-GEP algorithm are supported by rigorous statistical analysis, providing confidence in its accuracy and reliability. The high sensitivity and NPV, along with statistically significant results, affirm the algorithm's superiority in predicting SLN positivity compared to traditional methods.",
  "evaluation/availability": "The raw evaluation files are not publicly available. The data used in the study, including the evaluation files, are proprietary and will not be made available to the public. The study utilized a proprietary neural network algorithm that incorporates data from the 31-gene expression profile test and various clinicopathologic variables. This algorithm is designed to provide personalized risk assessments for sentinel lymph node metastasis in patients with cutaneous melanoma. While the study results and methodologies are detailed in the publication, the specific datasets and raw evaluation files remain confidential and are not accessible for public use."
