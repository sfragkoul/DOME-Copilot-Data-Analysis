  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was derived from the ChEMBL database, which is a well-known repository of bioactive drug discovery data. Additionally, recently published data on IDO inhibitors were collected from various literature sources. The dataset consists of 504 compounds, which were further divided into 242 active compounds and 262 inactive compounds. These compounds have data on their inhibitory activity against IDO.\n\nThe activity threshold for the compounds was set at 10 \u03bcM. The dataset was randomly split into training sets, containing 302 compounds, and test sets, containing 100 compounds. Furthermore, 102 compounds from recent studies were collected for external testing or validation.\n\nThe compounds in the dataset were checked and selected based on specific criteria. These criteria included the use of enzyme-based inhibitory assays with Kyn detection as the index, the availability of IC50 values for IDO, the removal of duplicated compounds and cell assay data, and the verification of IC50 values and structures against original references.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset used in this study was split into three main parts: a training set, a test set, and an external validation set. The training set consisted of 302 compounds derived from the ChEMBL database. The test set contained 100 compounds, also from the ChEMBL database. Additionally, 102 compounds from recent studies were collected for external testing or validation.\n\nThe dataset initially comprised 504 compounds, which were divided into 242 active compounds and 262 inactive compounds. These compounds had data on their inhibitory activity against IDO. The activity threshold for the compounds was set at 10 \u03bcM.\n\nThe models were validated using a 5-fold cross-validation method, which means the training set was further divided into five subsets. In each fold of the cross-validation, one subset was used as a validation set, and the remaining four subsets were used for training. This process was repeated five times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. The best model was then selected through an external testing process.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithms used in this study belong to the class of probabilistic and decision tree-based methods. Specifically, two types of models were constructed: Naive Bayesian (NB) and recursive partitioning (RP) models.\n\nThe Naive Bayesian method is a well-established probability classifier based on the Bayesian principle and the maximum posteriori hypothesis. It calculates the overall distribution of parameters based on prior distributions and uses this distribution to predict new sample data.\n\nThe recursive partitioning method, also known as decision tree learning, recursively divides a dataset into smaller subsets, resulting in a hierarchical tree that represents relationships among data points and independent descriptors. In this study, the tree depth was set to 20.\n\nThese algorithms are not new but are widely used in various fields, including cheminformatics and drug discovery. The choice of these algorithms was driven by their effectiveness in handling structured data and their ability to provide interpretable models. The focus of this publication is on the application of these methods to identify new indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitors, rather than the development of new machine-learning algorithms. Therefore, the algorithms were implemented using existing software, specifically DS 3.5, which is a comprehensive suite for computational chemistry and biology.",

  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, structural fingerprints were employed as descriptors for the Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) analysis. These fingerprints were calculated using DS 3.5 software. The selected fingerprints included ECFC, ECFP, EPFC, EPFP, FCFC, FCFP, FPFC, FPFP, LCFC, LCFP, LPFC, LPFP, and SEFP. Each of these fingerprints was computed with diameters of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. These structural fingerprints captured various molecular features and were used to represent the compounds in the dataset.\n\nThe data set consisted of 504 compounds, with 242 active compounds and 262 inactive compounds, all with known inhibitory activity against IDO. The compounds were derived from the ChEMBL database and recent literature. The activity threshold for the compounds was set to 10 \u03bcM. The dataset was divided into training sets (302 compounds) and test sets (100 compounds) randomly. Additionally, 102 compounds from recent studies were collected for external testing or validation.\n\nPrior to modeling, a diversity analysis was conducted to ensure the structural diversity of the chemical structures in the data library. The S-cluster approach was used to analyze cyclicity and complexity, which are key indexes for measuring structural diversity. Molecular properties such as A log P, logD, MW, solubility, pK_a, HBA, HBD, N-counts, and O-counts were calculated using DS 3.5 software. Student's t-test was employed to calculate the p-values of these properties for active and inactive compounds, helping to identify descriptors that could discriminate between active and inactive compounds.\n\nThe structural diversity and molecular properties of the compounds were visualized using an SCA plot and distribution graphs. This analysis confirmed that the training compounds were structurally diversified and drug-like, ensuring the robustness of the subsequent modeling process.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized structural fingerprints as descriptors for our Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models. These fingerprints were calculated using DS 3.5 software and included various types such as ECFC, ECFP, EPFC, EPFP, FCFC, FCFP, FPFC, FPFP, LCFC, LCFP, LPFC, LPFP, and SEFP. The diameters for these fingerprints ranged from 0 to 12, providing a comprehensive set of parameters to capture the structural diversity of the compounds.\n\nThe selection of these fingerprints and their diameters was based on their ability to discriminate between active and inactive compounds. For instance, the correlation coefficient between the descriptor O-counts and pIC50 was found to be 0.399, indicating a notable correlation. This suggests that the chosen descriptors are effective in capturing relevant structural features that influence the inhibitory activity against IDO.\n\nThe models were evaluated using a 5-fold cross-validation process, and the performances were assessed using metrics such as true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), false negatives (FN), sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), overall predictive accuracy (Q), Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). This rigorous evaluation ensured that the selected parameters were robust and reliable for predicting the activity of compounds against IDO.\n\nIn summary, the number of parameters (p) used in the model varied depending on the type and diameter of the fingerprints. The selection of these parameters was driven by their ability to discriminate between active and inactive compounds, as well as their performance in the model evaluation metrics.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized structural fingerprints as input features for our quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models. A total of 13 different types of structural fingerprints were calculated and used as descriptors. These fingerprints included ECFC, ECFP, EPFC, EPFP, FCFC, FCFP, FPFC, FPFP, LCFC, LCFP, LPFC, LPFP, and SEFP, with diameters ranging from 0 to 12.\n\nFeature selection was implicitly performed by evaluating the performance of models built using different combinations of these fingerprints and diameters. The models were constructed using both Naive Bayesian (NB) and recursive partitioning (RP) methods, and their performances were assessed using a 5-fold cross-validation process. The best-performing models were selected based on their overall predictive accuracy (Q), Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).\n\nThe selection of the best model involved an external testing process, ensuring that the feature selection and model validation were conducted rigorously. The final model chosen for virtual screening was the RP model based on the FPFC8 fingerprint, which demonstrated robust performance metrics. This approach ensured that the input features were optimized for predicting the inhibitory activity of compounds against the target protein.",

  "model/interpretability": "The models employed in this study include Naive Bayesian (NB) and recursive partitioning (RP) methods. The NB method is a probability classifier based on the Bayesian principle and the maximum posteriori hypothesis. It calculates the overall distribution of parameters based on prior distributions and uses this to predict new sample data. This makes the NB model somewhat interpretable, as it provides probabilities for class membership based on the input features.\n\nOn the other hand, the RP method, also known as decision tree learning, recursively divides the data set into smaller subsets, resulting in a hierarchical tree. This tree represents the relationships among data points and independent descriptors. The tree structure itself is interpretable, as each split in the tree corresponds to a decision based on a specific feature, making it clear how the model arrives at its predictions. In this study, the tree depth was set to 20, which means the model can capture complex relationships within the data while remaining interpretable.\n\nOverall, while the NB model provides probabilistic insights, the RP model offers a more transparent decision-making process through its tree structure. This transparency is particularly useful for understanding how different structural fingerprints influence the inhibitory activity predictions.",
  "model/output": "The models developed in this study are classification models. Specifically, recursive partitioning (RP) and naive Bayesian (NB) machine learning models were constructed to discriminate between active and inactive compounds. The performance of these models was evaluated using metrics such as overall predictive accuracy (Q), Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The models were trained and tested using structural fingerprints as descriptors, with diameters ranging from 0 to 12. The results indicated that models with fingerprint diameters greater than 4 performed well, with average MCC values exceeding 0.74 for the training set and 0.54 for the test set. Additionally, the top-10 models achieved Q values greater than 0.76, MCC values greater than 0.53, and AUC values greater than 0.89, demonstrating their robustness and reliability in classifying compounds based on their inhibitory activity.",

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the models involved a comprehensive process to ensure their robustness and predictive power. Initially, a 5-fold cross-validation method was employed to validate the models. This approach divides the dataset into five parts, using four parts for training and one part for testing, and repeats this process five times, each time with a different part as the test set. This method helps to assess the model's performance and generalizability.\n\nIn addition to cross-validation, an external testing process was conducted to select the best model. This involved using a separate set of data that was not part of the training or cross-validation process. The external testing data consisted of 102 compounds from recent studies, providing an independent evaluation of the model's predictive accuracy.\n\nThe performance of the models was evaluated using several metrics, including true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), false negatives (FN), sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), overall predictive accuracy (Q), Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). These metrics provided a thorough assessment of the models' ability to correctly identify active and inactive compounds.\n\nThe recursive partitioning (RP) models demonstrated better performance compared to the naive Bayesian (NB) models. Specifically, the RP models based on fingerprints FPFC2, FPFP6, FPFC8, and FPFP10 showed high MCC and AUC values, indicating strong predictive power. The RP model with fingerprint FPFC8 was selected as the winning model for virtually screening an in-house compound library, resulting in the identification of 50 virtual hits.\n\nThe selected hits were further validated through enzyme-based and cell-based assays, confirming their inhibitory activity against IDO. Compounds SYSU-00440, SYSU-00464, and SYSU-00469 were identified as potent inhibitors with IC50 values of 1.30, 4.10, and 4.68 \u03bcM, respectively. These compounds also showed significant inhibition in cell-based assays, particularly SYSU-00440 and SYSU-00469.\n\nSurface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments were conducted to confirm the binding of these compounds to IDO. The sensorgrams demonstrated the binding behavior of the compounds, with SYSU-00440 and SYSU-00464 showing similar binding profiles to SYSU-00469. Molecular dynamic simulations further elucidated the binding modes, revealing that these compounds interact with key residues within the IDO binding pocket, including Fe2+ of heme and hydrophobic pockets involving residues Y126, F163, and F226. The estimated \u0394G values for the compound-IDO complexes were consistent with their IC50 values, providing additional validation of their inhibitory activity.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our models, several performance metrics were reported to ensure a comprehensive assessment of their predictive capabilities. These metrics include true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN). From these, we derived sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), overall predictive accuracy (Q), the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). These metrics provide a robust evaluation of the models' performance, covering aspects such as the models' ability to correctly identify active and inactive compounds, as well as their overall accuracy and reliability.\n\nThe use of these metrics is representative of standard practices in the field. Sensitivity and specificity measure the models' ability to correctly identify active and inactive compounds, respectively. The overall predictive accuracy (Q) gives a general measure of the models' correctness. The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) is particularly useful as it takes into account all four categories of the confusion matrix (TP, TN, FP, FN), providing a balanced measure even when the classes are of very different sizes. The AUC provides a single scalar value that summarizes the performance of the model across all classification thresholds.\n\nAdditionally, the models were evaluated using a 5-fold cross-validation process, which is a common technique to ensure that the models generalize well to unseen data. This process involves dividing the data into five subsets, training the model on four subsets, and testing it on the remaining subset. This procedure is repeated five times, with each subset serving as the test set once. Furthermore, an independent external test set was used to evaluate the actual prediction power of the models, ensuring that the models' performance is not overestimated due to overfitting.\n\nThe reported metrics and evaluation methods are in line with established practices in the literature, ensuring that our models' performance can be compared and validated against other studies in the field.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we did not perform a direct comparison with publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. Instead, we focused on developing and evaluating our own models using a dataset of 504 compounds with known inhibitory activity against IDO. This dataset was divided into training and test sets to validate our models.\n\nWe constructed two types of machine learning models: Naive Bayesian (NB) and recursive partitioning (RP) models. The NB method is a probability classifier based on Bayesian principles, while the RP method generates a decision tree by recursively dividing the dataset into smaller subsets. We generated 86 models of each type and evaluated their performance using a 5-fold cross-validation process.\n\nTo assess the quality of our models, we calculated various metrics such as true positives, true negatives, false positives, false negatives, sensitivity, specificity, overall predictive accuracy, Matthews correlation coefficient, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The models with the highest performance metrics were selected for further validation using an independent external test set.\n\nWhile we did not compare our methods directly with simpler baselines or publicly available methods, our models demonstrated good predictive accuracy and were able to identify potential IDO inhibitors from an in-house compound library. The top-performing models had overall predictive accuracy values greater than 0.76, Matthews correlation coefficient values greater than 0.53, and AUC values greater than 0.89. These results suggest that our models are robust and reliable for virtual screening of IDO inhibitors.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the models in this study was conducted using a 5-fold cross-validation process, which is a robust method for assessing the performance and generalizability of predictive models. Several key performance metrics were calculated, including true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), false negatives (FN), sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), overall predictive accuracy (Q), Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). These metrics provide a comprehensive view of the models' performance.\n\nThe models demonstrated strong performance, with the top-10 models achieving Q values greater than 0.76, MCC values greater than 0.53, and AUC values greater than 0.89. These results suggest that the models are of good quality and have high predictive accuracy. Additionally, the models were validated using an independent external test set, which further confirms their reliability and robustness.\n\nThe study also compared the performance of recursive partitioning (RP) models and Naive Bayesian (NB) models. The RP models, particularly those based on specific fingerprints (FPFC2, FPFP6, FPFC8, and FPFP10), showed better performance with higher MCC and AUC values. This indicates that the RP models are more effective in discriminating between active and inactive compounds.\n\nStatistical significance was assessed using Student's t-test to compare the properties of active and inactive compounds. The p-values and correlation coefficients between different descriptors were calculated, providing a statistical basis for the observed correlations and differences. This ensures that the findings are not due to random chance but are statistically significant.\n\nOverall, the evaluation process was rigorous and comprehensive, involving multiple performance metrics, cross-validation, and external testing. The results are statistically significant and demonstrate the superior performance of the RP models in predicting IDO inhibitory activity.",
