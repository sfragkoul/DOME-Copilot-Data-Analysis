  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent immunotherapy. The primary cohort consisted of patients used to train and develop the prediction models. Additionally, two validation cohorts, comprising a total of 131 patients, were used to independently evaluate the prediction models.\n\nThe study involved a total of 224 patients. Among these, 93 patients were in the primary cohort, while the remaining patients were distributed across two validation cohorts. The demographics and clinical characteristics of these patients were summarized, revealing that responders to immunotherapy varied across the cohorts, with percentages of 36.5%, 22.1%, and 38.1% in the primary cohort, validation cohort 1, and validation cohort 2, respectively. The dataset included a mix of histologic variants, predominantly adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).\n\nThe CT images of each patient were acquired at pre-treatment and during the first follow-up (6 to 8 weeks) after immunotherapy. These images were obtained using multi-slice CT systems from various manufacturers, ensuring a standardized approach with a tube voltage of 120 kVp and automatic tube current modulation. The images were reconstructed with a consistent image matrix of 512 \u00d7 512 pixels, and the in-plane pixel spacing and slice thickness varied slightly across the cohorts.\n\nThe study was conducted in accordance with ethical guidelines, with institutional review boards (IRBs) approving the multi-center study. Due to its retrospective nature, the requirement for informed consent forms was waived. This approach ensured that the dataset was comprehensive and representative of the patient population undergoing immunotherapy for advanced NSCLC.\n\nThe dataset utilized in this study has not been previously published or used by the community in the same context. The focus on CT images and radiomics features is a novel approach to predicting immunotherapy response in advanced NSCLC, contributing to the existing body of knowledge in this field.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into three distinct cohorts: a primary cohort and two validation cohorts. The primary cohort consisted of 93 patients and was used to train and develop the prediction models. The remaining 131 patients were split into two validation cohorts, each used to independently evaluate the prediction models. In the primary cohort, responders to immunotherapy accounted for 36.5% (34 out of 93) of the patients. In validation cohort 1, which had 68 patients, 22.1% (15 out of 68) were responders. Validation cohort 2, comprising 63 patients, had 38.1% (24 out of 63) responders. The total number of patients across all cohorts was 224, with 184 men (82.1%) and 40 women (17.9%). The average age of the patients was 65, ranging from 27 to 86 years. The histologic variants of advanced NSCLC included adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The distribution of histologic types varied across the cohorts: in the primary cohort, 61.3% (57 out of 93) had ADC and 38.7% (36 out of 93) had SCC. In validation cohort 1, 79.4% (54 out of 68) had ADC and 20.6% (14 out of 68) had SCC. In validation cohort 2, 60.3% (38 out of 63) had ADC and 39.7% (25 out of 63) had SCC.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets were split into a primary cohort and two validation cohorts. The primary cohort was used to train and develop the prediction models, while the remaining 131 patients in the two validation cohorts were used to evaluate the prediction models independently. This ensures that the training and test sets are independent.\n\nThe independence of the datasets was enforced by using patients from different centers for the validation cohorts. The institutional review boards in two centers approved this multi-center study, ensuring that the data collection and splitting process was conducted ethically and rigorously.\n\nThe distribution of the datasets compares favorably to previously published machine learning datasets in the field. The primary cohort consisted of 93 patients, with responders to immunotherapy making up 36.5% of the cohort. The validation cohorts had 68 and 63 patients, with response rates of 22.1% and 38.1%, respectively. This distribution reflects the real-world variability and challenges in predicting immunotherapy responses, making the study robust and generalizable.",
  "dataset/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in our study is the support vector machine (SVM) classifier. This is a well-established and widely used algorithm in the field of machine learning, particularly for classification tasks.\n\nThe SVM classifier employed in our research is not a new algorithm. It has been extensively studied and applied in various domains, including medical imaging and radiomics. The choice of SVM for our study was driven by its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data and its robustness in classification tasks.\n\nGiven that SVM is a mature and well-documented algorithm, it was not necessary to publish it in a machine-learning journal. Instead, our focus was on applying this established method to a specific problem in medical imaging\u2014predicting the response to immunotherapy in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using CT-based radiomics features. The innovation lies in the application of SVM to this particular clinical challenge, rather than in the development of a new algorithm.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model developed in this study does not function as a meta-predictor. Instead, it relies on radiomics features extracted from CT images to predict immunotherapy response in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. The primary focus is on using pre-treatment and delta-radiomics features to train support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. These classifiers are used to develop the pre-radiomics and delta-radiomics models, respectively.\n\nThe delta-radiomics model, which showed higher prognostic values than the pre-radiomics model, utilizes changes observed in short-term follow-up CT scans. This approach leverages the dynamic changes in tumor characteristics during immunotherapy to enhance predictive accuracy.\n\nThe study employed a synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) to address the imbalance in the training dataset, specifically to generate synthetic \"responder\" samples. This technique helps in creating a more balanced training dataset, which is crucial for the performance of the SVM classifier.\n\nThe evaluation of the models included the use of various metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and others. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to assess the prognostic value of the rad-scores generated by the models.\n\nIn summary, the model does not integrate outputs from other machine-learning algorithms as input. It is solely based on radiomics features derived from CT images and utilizes SVM for classification. The training data for the models is independent, with the primary cohort used for training and validation cohorts used for independent evaluation.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding process involved several steps to ensure that the radiomics features were suitable for input into the machine-learning algorithm. Initially, all CT images were resampled to a uniform spacing of 1 mm \u00d7 1 mm \u00d7 1 mm using a cubic spline interpolation algorithm. This step was crucial to eliminate radiographic differences between images acquired from various scanners.\n\nA total of 1118 CT-radiomics features were computed for each targeted tumor on both pre- and post-treatment CT images. These features were extracted from the original CT images as well as two transformed images: Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) and wavelet images. The initial feature pool consisted of 106 original features, 276 LoG features, and 736 wavelet features. The original features included 14 shape features, 18 histogram features, and 74 texture features. Among the texture features, there were 23 gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features, 16 gray-level run length matrix (GLRLM) features, 16 gray level size zone matrix (GLSZM) features, 14 gray level difference matrix (GLDM) features, and 5 neighborhood gray-tone difference matrix (NGTDM) features. The LoG and wavelet features were composed of histogram and texture features, with LoG features extracted using a filter configured with \u03c3 values of 1, 2, and 3, and wavelet features computed using a coif1 wavelet with eight decompositions per level in each of the three dimensions.\n\nDelta radiomics features, representing the changes between pre- and post-treatment CT radiomics features, were calculated by subtracting the pre-treatment features from the post-treatment features. Before developing the prediction model, several feature engineering techniques were applied. Each radiomics feature was normalized using a feature standard scaler, which removed the mean and scaled the feature to unit variance. The normalized feature was calculated using the formula F_norm = (F - U_F) / S_F, where F_norm is the normalized feature, U_F is the mean value of the feature, and S_F is the standard deviation of the feature.\n\nTo select the optimal features and reduce dimensionality, a feature ranking method called recursive feature elimination (RFE) was employed. The RFE feature selector was configured with a ridge regression linear model. This process ensured that only the most relevant features were retained for the subsequent machine-learning steps.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized a comprehensive set of radiomics features extracted from CT images to develop predictive models for immunotherapy response in advanced NSCLC patients. Initially, we computed 1118 CT-radiomics features from pre- and post-treatment images. These features included original image features, Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) image features, and wavelet image features. The original feature set comprised 14 shape features, 18 histogram features, and 74 texture features, which further broke down into various texture matrices such as GLCM, GLRLM, GLSZM, GLDM, and NGTDM.\n\nTo handle the high dimensionality of these features, we employed feature engineering techniques. We normalized each radiomics feature by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. Subsequently, we applied recursive feature elimination (RFE) with a ridge regression linear model to rank and select the optimal features, thereby reducing dimensionality.\n\nFor the pre-radiomics model, seven features were selected, including two original image features, one LoG image feature, and four wavelet image features. The delta-radiomics model, which focused on the changes between pre- and post-treatment features, selected four wavelet image features.\n\nThe selection of these features was crucial for developing robust prediction models. We used a support vector machine (SVM) classifier with a linear kernel to build the models. The final models utilized the selected radiomics features to predict the response to immunotherapy, demonstrating improved performance metrics such as AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity compared to traditional methods.",
  "optimization/features": "In the development of our radiomics models, we initially extracted a comprehensive set of features from CT images.

This process was configured with a ridge regression linear model and was applied to select the optimal features and reduce dimensionality. The feature selection was conducted using only the training set to ensure that the model's performance on the validation sets remained unbiased.\n\nAs a result of this feature selection process, the pre-radiomics model selected seven features, including two original image features, one LoG image feature, and four wavelet image features. The delta-radiomics model, which focuses on the changes between pre- and post-treatment features, selected four wavelet image features. These selected features were then used to train and evaluate our classification models.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The number of parameters in our model was indeed much larger than the number of training points, as we initially extracted 1118 CT-radiomics features from the images. To address the potential issue of over-fitting, several steps were taken.\n\nFirst, we applied feature normalization using a standard scaler to ensure that each feature had a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. This helped in stabilizing the training process and making the optimization landscape smoother.\n\nNext, we used recursive feature elimination (RFE) with a ridge regression linear model to select the optimal features and reduce the dimensionality of the radiomics features. This process helped in identifying the most relevant features and discarding the less important ones, thereby reducing the risk of over-fitting.\n\nAdditionally, we employed a synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) to balance the training dataset. This technique generated synthetic samples for the minority class, which helped in creating a more balanced dataset and improving the model's generalization ability.\n\nTo further validate the model's performance and rule out over-fitting, we used two independent validation cohorts. The model was trained on the primary cohort and then evaluated on these validation cohorts. The consistent performance across different cohorts indicated that the model was not over-fitting to the training data.\n\nRegarding under-fitting, the use of a support vector machine (SVM) classifier with a linear kernel provided a robust framework for capturing complex patterns in the data. The SVM is known for its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces and its ability to find the optimal boundary between classes. Moreover, the selection of relevant features through RFE ensured that the model had access to the most informative features, reducing the risk of under-fitting.\n\nIn summary, the combination of feature normalization, dimensionality reduction through RFE, data balancing with SMOTE, and rigorous validation on independent cohorts helped in mitigating both over-fitting and under-fitting issues.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our models. Given the imbalanced nature of our training dataset, we utilized the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). This method helps to balance the dataset by generating synthetic samples for the minority class, which in our case were the \"responder\" samples. SMOTE was configured with a five-nearest neighbors algorithm to create these synthetic instances, thereby enhancing the diversity and representativeness of the minority class in the training dataset.\n\nAdditionally, we applied feature normalization to standardize the radiomics features. This process involved removing the mean and scaling to unit variance, which helps in stabilizing and speeding up the training process, and can also prevent overfitting by ensuring that all features contribute equally to the model.\n\nFurthermore, we used recursive feature elimination (RFE) with a ridge regression linear model to select the optimal features and reduce dimensionality. This technique iteratively removes the least significant features, retaining only those that contribute most to the model's predictive power. By doing so, we not only simplified the model but also reduced the risk of overfitting by eliminating irrelevant or redundant features.\n\nIn the development of our classification models, we employed a support vector machine (SVM) with a linear kernel. SVMs are known for their effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces and their ability to handle overfitting through the use of regularization parameters. The linear kernel was chosen for its simplicity and efficiency in handling the feature space defined by our radiomics data.\n\nTo validate the performance and generalizability of our models, we used independent validation cohorts. This approach ensures that the models are not overfitted to the training data and can perform well on unseen data. The use of multiple validation cohorts further strengthens the robustness of our findings by demonstrating consistent performance across different patient populations.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization schedule used in our study are detailed within the publication. Specifically, the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was configured with five nearest neighbors to generate synthetic samples in the training dataset. The support vector machine (SVM) classifier utilized a linear kernel. These details are provided to ensure reproducibility of our methods.\n\nThe model files and optimization parameters are not explicitly shared in the publication. However, the methods and techniques used, such as the SMOTE algorithm and SVM classifier, are standard and widely documented in the machine learning literature. The Python libraries employed, including Pyradiomics, SimpleITK, Scikit-learn, SciPy, Matplotlib, NumPy, and Pandas, are publicly available and can be accessed under their respective open-source licenses.\n\nFor those interested in replicating our study, the specific configurations and parameters can be inferred from the descriptions provided. The use of standard libraries and well-documented techniques ensures that the methods are accessible and can be implemented by other researchers.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in this study is not entirely transparent and can be considered somewhat of a black box. The primary approach used is a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, which, while powerful, does not inherently provide clear interpretability for its predictions. The SVM classifier was trained using radiomics features extracted from CT images, both pre-treatment and short-term follow-up.\n\nTo enhance the interpretability, feature selection techniques such as recursive feature elimination (RFE) were employed. This method helps in identifying the most relevant radiomics features, reducing the dimensionality of the data, and potentially making the model more interpretable. However, the specific contributions of individual features to the final prediction remain opaque.\n\nAdditionally, the use of synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) to balance the training dataset introduces further complexity. While SMOTE helps in mitigating the issues arising from imbalanced data, it does not contribute to the interpretability of the model.\n\nIn summary, while efforts were made to select relevant features and balance the dataset, the model's predictions are not easily interpretable. The relationships between the input features and the output predictions are not straightforward, making it challenging to provide clear examples of how specific features influence the model's decisions.",
  "model/output": "The model developed is a classification model. It is designed to predict the response to immunotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. The model uses support vector machine (SVM) classifiers, which are trained on pre-treatment and delta CT-radiomics features to develop the pre-radiomics and delta-radiomics feature-based models, respectively.\n\nThe classification model was built using a synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) to address the imbalance in the training dataset. This technique was configured with a five-nearest neighbors algorithm to generate synthetic samples, specifically to balance the number of \"responder\" samples in the primary cohort.\n\nThe performance of the classification models was evaluated using various metrics, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), odds ratio (OR), F1 score, F1 weighted score, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). These metrics were used to compare the performance of the pre-radiomics model, delta-radiomics model, and RECIST model across primary and validation cohorts.\n\nThe delta-radiomics model demonstrated higher prognostic values than the pre-radiomics model, as shown by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. This indicates that the delta-radiomics model may contribute to stratifying patients into high- and low-risk groups with different progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).\n\nIn summary, the model is a classification model aimed at predicting immunotherapy response in advanced NSCLC patients, with the delta-radiomics model showing superior performance in prognostic value and risk stratification.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "The source code for the radiomics model development was implemented using Python software (version 3.9). Several publicly available Python libraries were utilized, including Pyradiomics, SimpleITK, Scikit-learn, SciPy, Matplotlib, NumPy, and Pandas. These libraries are open-source and can be accessed through their respective repositories.\n\nFor the survival analysis, R software (version 4.1.1) was employed. The specific packages and functions used in R are standard and widely available within the R community.\n\nRegarding the availability of the method to run the algorithm, the details are not specified. However, the use of standard libraries suggests that the methods can be replicated by anyone with access to these tools. The exact executable, web server, virtual machine, or container instance for running the algorithm is not mentioned, so it is not clear if these are publicly available.\n\nThe licensing information for the use of the mentioned libraries is typically provided in their respective repositories. Users interested in replicating the study should refer to the licensing agreements of Pyradiomics, SimpleITK, Scikit-learn, SciPy, Matplotlib, NumPy, and Pandas for Python, and the relevant R packages for R software.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the proposed method involved several steps to ensure its robustness and effectiveness. Initially, the primary cohort of patients was used to train and develop the prediction models. Subsequently, two independent validation cohorts, comprising a total of 131 patients, were employed to evaluate the performance of these models.\n\nThe evaluation process included the use of various metrics to assess the classification model's performance. These metrics encompassed the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and its corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI), which were estimated using bootstrap resampling procedures with 1000 iterations. The Delong test was utilized to compare the ROCs of different radiomics models. Additionally, a series of quantitative metrics were calculated, including accuracy (ACC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), odds ratio (OR), F1 score, F1 weighted score, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). A cutoff threshold of 0.5 was applied to the prediction probabilities generated by the radiomics models to obtain binary classification results.\n\nIn the survival analysis, the risk scores generated by the classification models were used as rad-scores to predict the prognosis of advanced NSCLC patients. A default cutoff threshold of 0.5 was applied to the rad-score of the CT-radiomics model to divide patients into low- and high-risk groups. The Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analysis method was then used to evaluate the prognostic value of the rad-score generated by the CT-radiomics model. The Harrell\u2019s concordance index (C-index) and hazard ratio (HR) were employed to evaluate the value of the rad-score in estimating progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The Log-Rank test was used to compare the differences between KM curves.\n\nThe evaluation also involved comparing the AUC, PFS-HR, and OS-HR values reported in previously published literature to assess the performance of the proposed model. The delta-radiomics model demonstrated higher prognostic values than the pre-radiomics model, as shown by the Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. This indicates that the proposed radiomics model can effectively stratify patients into high- and low-risk groups with different PFS and OS outcomes.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the \"Performance Measures\" subsection, we report several key metrics to evaluate the performance of our radiomics models in predicting immunotherapy response and prognosis.\n\nFor response prediction, we primarily use the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, which provides a comprehensive measure of the model's ability to distinguish between responders and non-responders. Additionally, we report Accuracy (ACC), Sensitivity, Specificity, Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV), Odds Ratio (OR), F1 Score, F1 Weighted Score, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). These metrics offer a detailed view of the model's performance, including its precision, recall, and overall balance.\n\nFor prognostic evaluation, we use the C-index and Hazard Ratios (HR) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) for predicting Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS). The C-index measures the model's discriminative ability for survival outcomes, while HR indicates the relative risk of events occurring in different groups stratified by the model.\n\nThe reported metrics are representative of those commonly used in the literature for evaluating radiomics models in similar contexts. For instance, studies by Sun R (2018), Trebeschi S (2019), and Khorrami M (2020) also report AUC values and HRs for PFS and OS, aligning with our approach. This consistency ensures that our evaluation is comparable to existing research, facilitating a meaningful assessment of our model's performance.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we compared the performance of our proposed short-term follow-up CT-based radiomics model with other reported studies. Our method yielded relatively higher performance metrics, such as AUC, PFS-HR, and OS-HR, when evaluated on the largest dataset among the compared studies. This comparison highlights the effectiveness of our approach in predicting the response to immunotherapy in advanced NSCLC.\n\nWe also evaluated our model against simpler baselines, including the pre-radiomics model and the RECIST 1.1 criterion. The delta-radiomics model demonstrated superior prognostic values in predicting progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to the pre-radiomics model. This was evident from the higher hazard ratios (HRs) and concordance indexes (C-indexes) observed in both the primary and validation cohorts.\n\nAdditionally, we compared our model's performance with the RECIST 1.1 criterion, which is commonly used to evaluate the best response of immunotherapy. The delta-radiomics model outperformed the RECIST model in terms of HRs and C-indexes, indicating its potential to provide more accurate and reliable predictions.\n\nFurthermore, we assessed the model's performance across different patient subgroups, specifically adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients. The radiomics model performed better on ADC patients than on SCC patients, suggesting that the model's predictive power may vary depending on the tumor subtype.\n\nIn summary, our study involved a comprehensive comparison with both publicly available methods and simpler baselines, demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed radiomics approach in predicting immunotherapy response in advanced NSCLC.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our proposed radiomics models includes several performance metrics with associated confidence intervals, providing a measure of the uncertainty and reliability of our results. For instance, hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are reported for predicting progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. These metrics are presented in tables, showing the comparative performance of the delta-radiomics model, pre-radiomics model, and RECIST model across primary and validation cohorts.\n\nStatistical significance is assessed using p-values, which indicate whether the observed differences in performance are likely due to chance. For example, the delta-radiomics model demonstrates statistically significant improvements in predicting PFS and OS compared to the pre-radiomics model and RECIST model, as evidenced by lower p-values. This suggests that the delta-radiomics model's superior performance is not due to random variation but reflects a genuine improvement in predictive accuracy.\n\nAdditionally, the Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves further support the statistical significance and robustness of our findings. The KM survival curves illustrate the stratification effects of the rad-scores generated by different models, showing significant differences in survival outcomes between high- and low-risk groups. The ROC curves compare the area under the curve (AUC) values, highlighting the delta-radiomics model's superior performance in distinguishing between responders and non-responders to immunotherapy.\n\nOverall, the inclusion of confidence intervals and the assessment of statistical significance through p-values, KM survival curves, and ROC curves provide a comprehensive evaluation of our models' performance. These measures enhance the confidence in our claims that the delta-radiomics model offers superior prognostic value compared to other models.",
