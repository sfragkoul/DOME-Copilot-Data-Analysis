  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from the Epic Clarity database of the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). This database contains electronic health records (EHR) of patients, from which we queried data for three cohorts: ASD, psychiatric (non-ASD), and nonpsychiatric.\n\nInitially, we identified 33,230 ASD patients with 3,611,649 clinical notes using ICD-9 and ICD-10-CM codes. After rigorous quality control, the final dataset consisted of 8,499 ASD patients with 56,958 high-quality (HQ) clinical notes from the psychiatric department. Additionally, we created two comparison cohorts: 8,177 individuals with psychiatric (non-ASD) conditions and 8,482 individuals without any ASD or psychiatric problems, with 41,753 and 21,028 HQ notes respectively.\n\nThe data used in this study builds upon previous work, including the use of the CLAMP tool for named entity recognition, which was previously validated for extracting ASD named entities. The terminology set developed in this study was compared with an existing published ASD vocabulary, demonstrating its superiority in distinguishing ASD patients from non-ASD psychiatric patients. The dataset and methodology aim to contribute to the broader community's understanding and diagnostic tools for ASD.",
  "dataset/splits": "We initially identified 33,230 ASD patients with 3,611,649 clinical notes using ICD-9 and ICD-10-CM codes. To enable statistical comparisons, we created two comparison cohorts: a non-ASD psychiatric cohort and a nonpsychiatric cohort. The initial number of patients and clinical notes, along with their respective ICD codes, is detailed in supplementary material.\n\nAfter rigorous quality control, we validated 56,958 high-quality clinical notes from 8,499 individuals with ASD. For the control groups, we validated 41,753 high-quality notes from 8,177 individuals with psychiatric (non-ASD) conditions and 21,028 high-quality notes from 8,482 individuals without any ASD or psychiatric problems. The distribution of high-quality psychiatric notes for each ASD individual can be found in supplementary material.\n\nThe age and gender distribution of individuals with ASD showed that among these patients, 26,020 are males, 7,218 are females, and 24 are of unknown gender. The age at diagnosis was calculated from the date of diagnosis and date of birth for minors. The final number of patients, number of high-quality psychiatric notes, and gender distributions for the ASD and the other two control cohorts are shown in supplementary material.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "Not enough information is available.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data used in this study is not publicly released in a forum. However, the terminology set created from the data is provided without license restrictions. This allows anyone studying ASD to benefit from the use of standardized terminologies and ontologies, enabling cross-institutional studies. The terminology set is organized in a formal ontology structure, similar to the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). This structure facilitates the characterization of individuals with ASD, aiding in automated diagnosis and subtyping for personalized therapeutic decision-making. The data itself, including the specific data splits used, remains within the confines of the study and is not made publicly available. This approach ensures that the data is used responsibly and in accordance with institutional review board approvals and ethical guidelines.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm used in our study primarily involves machine learning techniques, specifically natural language processing (NLP) and dimensionality reduction methods. We employed a term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm to analyze our ASD term set, which helps in normalizing terms across clinical texts and assigning weights based on their rarity. This step is crucial for identifying informative terms that are less frequent but more indicative of ASD symptoms.\n\nFollowing TF-IDF, we utilized nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) to reduce the dimensionality of the data. NMF is a well-established technique in the field of machine learning and data science, known for its ability to decompose a matrix into two lower-dimensional matrices, thereby revealing underlying patterns in the data. This process is essential for clustering patients based on their phenotypic characteristics.\n\nAdditionally, we used t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) for data visualization. t-SNE is a popular dimensionality reduction technique that helps in visualizing high-dimensional data by mapping it to a lower-dimensional space while preserving the local structure of the data.\n\nThe algorithms used in our study are not new but are widely recognized and applied in various fields, including bioinformatics and medical research. The choice of these algorithms is driven by their effectiveness in handling large datasets and their ability to uncover complex patterns. While these algorithms are not novel, their application in the context of ASD phenotype characterization is innovative and contributes significantly to the field of neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nThe focus of our publication is on the application of these machine learning techniques to improve the diagnosis and characterization of ASD, rather than the development of new algorithms. Therefore, it is appropriate for our findings to be published in a journal focused on neurodevelopmental disorders, as it highlights the practical implications and advancements in the field of ASD research.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model described in the publication does not function as a traditional meta-predictor that combines outputs from multiple machine-learning algorithms. Instead, it primarily relies on natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify and curate ASD phenotypic terms from raw clinical notes in electronic health records (EHRs). The process involves several steps, including named entity recognition (NER) using tools like CLAMP and BioBERT, statistical analysis to filter relevant terms, and dimensionality reduction methods like NMF for clustering patients.\n\nThe workflow includes patient cohort selection, data quality control on raw clinical notes, identifying ASD phenotype terms through NLP and statistical analysis, and quantifying individual ASD patients\u2019 phenotypes using the terminology set. The final ASD terminology set contains 3336 phenotype terms organized into a 5-layer ontology structure based on DSM-5 criteria.\n\nWhile the model does not explicitly use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input, it does incorporate a human-machine complementary strategy. This approach ensures that clinicians are involved in refining the machine output, which is crucial for delivering a high-quality ASD vocabulary. The training data for the NLP models, such as BioBERT, is derived from high-quality clinical texts, and cross-validation is performed to ensure the robustness of the identified terms.\n\nThe independence of the training data is maintained through rigorous quality control measures. These measures include removing short descriptions, excluding patients with fewer visits, and ensuring that the clinical notes match the dates of given ICD codes for ASD. Additionally, the model uses a combination of rule-based methods and deep learning techniques to validate and extract ASD terms, ensuring that the terms are both clinically relevant and statistically significant.\n\nIn summary, the model leverages advanced NLP techniques and statistical methods to create a comprehensive ASD terminology set. It does not function as a meta-predictor in the traditional sense but rather integrates human expertise with machine learning to enhance the accuracy and reliability of ASD diagnosis.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, we employed several techniques to encode and preprocess the data for our machine-learning algorithms. Initially, we identified and curated ASD phenotypic terms from raw clinical notes using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. This resulted in a set of 3336 ASD terms linked to 1943 unique medical concepts.\n\nTo quantify individual ASD patients' phenotypes, we created a binary data matrix where rows represented patients and columns represented terms. This matrix indicated the presence or absence of specific terms in each patient's clinical notes.\n\nWe then applied the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) method to transform this binary matrix. TF-IDF assigns weights to terms based on their frequency in a patient's notes and their rarity across all notes. This method normalized the terms, giving less weight to frequent terms and higher weights to rare ones, thereby highlighting the most informative terms for describing ASD symptoms.\n\nFollowing TF-IDF, we used nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) to reduce the dimensionality of the data. NMF decomposed the TF-IDF matrix into two smaller matrices, effectively clustering patients based on their phenotypic terms.\n\nFor visualization, we employed t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). This technique plotted the reduced-dimensional data, allowing us to observe distinct clusters of ASD patients and compare them with non-ASD psychiatric patients. This encoding and preprocessing pipeline enabled us to effectively analyze and cluster ASD patients based on their phenotypic characteristics.",
  "optimization/parameters": "Not applicable",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized a comprehensive set of features derived from high-quality clinical notes to identify and characterize ASD phenotypes. The final ASD terminology set contained 3336 phenotype terms, which were organized into a 5-layer ontology structure. These terms were used as input features for our analysis.\n\nFeature selection was performed to ensure that the most relevant and informative terms were included. This process involved several steps, including named entity recognition (NER) using the CLAMP pipeline, statistical analysis to calculate odds ratios, and semantic filtering based on UMLS semantic types. The feature selection was conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the validation and testing sets remained unbiased.\n\nThe selected features were then used to create a binary data matrix, where each row represented a patient and each column represented an ASD term. This matrix was transformed using the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) method to normalize the terms across all clinical texts, giving less weight to more frequent terms and higher weights to rarer terms. This approach helped to highlight the most informative terms for distinguishing ASD patients from non-ASD psychiatric patients.",
  "optimization/fitting": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/regularization": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/config": "Not applicable.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in this study is designed to be transparent and interpretable, rather than a black box. This transparency is achieved through several key aspects of the methodology.\n\nFirstly, the model utilizes a structured ontology to represent ASD phenotypes. This ontology is organized hierarchically, with five levels that range from broad categories to specific phenotype terms. Each term in the ontology has associated properties, such as its standard name, semantic type, and odds ratios, which provide clear and interpretable information about its relevance to ASD.\n\nSecondly, the model employs natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract phenotype terms from clinical notes. These terms are mapped to the ontology, allowing for a direct link between the raw clinical data and the structured phenotype information. This mapping process is transparent and can be traced back to the original clinical notes, ensuring that the model's outputs are grounded in real-world data.\n\nAdditionally, the model uses dimensionality reduction techniques, such as nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and t-SNE, to cluster patients based on their phenotype profiles. These techniques provide visualizations that can be easily interpreted by clinicians and researchers. For example, the t-SNE plots show distinct clusters of ASD patients, which can be further analyzed to understand the underlying phenotype characteristics.\n\nFurthermore, the model's outputs are directly linked to the DSM-5 criteria for ASD diagnosis. This linkage allows for a clear interpretation of how the model's predictions align with established diagnostic guidelines. For instance, the radar plots and individual patient mappings to DSM-5 criteria provide a transparent view of how the model's phenotype terms correspond to the diagnostic criteria.\n\nIn summary, the model's transparency is ensured through the use of a structured ontology, NLP-based term extraction, dimensionality reduction techniques, and direct linkage to DSM-5 criteria. These features make the model interpretable and suitable for use in clinical settings, where transparency and interpretability are crucial for effective diagnosis and treatment.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in our study is primarily focused on classification tasks. We utilized non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) for clustering patients based on their phenotypic characteristics. This clustering analysis helped in differentiating individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) from those with non-ASD psychiatric conditions. The output of this process was a set of clusters that could be visualized using t-SNE plots, demonstrating distinct subgroups within the ASD population. Additionally, we mapped these subgroups to the DSM-5 criteria, providing a detailed characterization of each patient's phenotypic traits. The model's output facilitated the identification of key diagnostic information from clinical notes, which was then used to assist in automated diagnosis and subtyping of ASD patients. This approach allowed for a more nuanced understanding of ASD phenotypes, aiding in personalized therapeutic decision-making.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "The source code for the specific algorithms and tools used in our study is not publicly released. However, we utilized several open-source software and libraries throughout our research. For instance, we employed Owlready2, a Python package, to generate a comprehensive file covering the entire information of the ASD ontology. Additionally, we visualized the ASD phenotype ontology using Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, an open-source software for ontology visualization. These tools are freely available and can be accessed through their respective repositories or websites. For those interested in replicating parts of our workflow, these open-source tools provide a starting point. Unfortunately, the custom scripts and specific implementations developed for this study are not available for public use at this time.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method employed a comprehensive approach to ensure the robustness and accuracy of the identified ASD phenotype terms. Initially, a gold standard ASD term set was established by collecting ASD vocabularies from previous studies and manually verifying them using DSM-5 criteria with the help of ASD clinicians. This gold standard set was then used to train and validate a deep learning-based BioBERT NER algorithm on high-quality clinical texts from the ASD cohort. The clinical texts were split into training, testing, and validation sets, with 70%, 15%, and 15% of the data respectively. The tokens were labeled using the gold standard ASD terms and the inside-outside-beginning (IOB) tagging scheme. To ensure the reliability of the extracted terms, the process was repeated ten times as cross-validation, covering a broader range of clinical texts.\n\nThe performance of the BioBERT algorithm was evaluated by comparing the predicted named entities (NEs) with the gold standard terms. The predicted NEs from the testing set were manually verified to confirm their validity as true aliases of the gold standard ASD terms. This step was crucial in filtering out false positives and ensuring that the terms were genuinely associated with ASD.\n\nAdditionally, the cosine similarity between the embedding vectors of the ASD NEs and the gold standard terms was calculated using Sent2Vec. Terms with a similarity value greater than 0.5 were considered ASD phenotype terms. This semantic filtering further refined the list of ASD terms, ensuring that only the most relevant and accurate terms were included.\n\nThe final list of 3336 high-confidence ASD phenotype terms was organized into a 5-layer ontology structure based on DSM-5 criteria and clinician input. The utility of this terminology set was demonstrated through clustering analysis, where it successfully differentiated ASD patients from non-ASD psychiatric patients and mapped individual patients' phenotypes to DSM-5 criteria. The clustering results showed distinct subgroups of ASD patients, highlighting the effectiveness of the terminology set in characterizing ASD phenotypes.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we evaluated the performance of our ASD phenotype terminology set using several key metrics and comparative analyses. One of the primary performance measures we reported is the ability of our terminology set to distinguish ASD patients from non-ASD psychiatric patients. This was assessed through dimensional reduction analysis, where our set demonstrated superior performance compared to existing published ASD vocabularies, such as the one developed by Lingren et al.\n\nWe also performed clustering analysis using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and visualized the results with t-SNE plots. These visualizations showed that our terminology set effectively separates ASD patients into distinct subgroups and differentiates them from non-ASD psychiatric patients. This clustering capability is crucial for characterizing ASD phenotypes and aligning them with DSM-5 criteria.\n\nAdditionally, we quantified the number of ASD terms that could be identified in patient notes. Our set identified a significantly higher number of ASD terms in both ASD and non-ASD psychiatric groups compared to Lingren\u2019s list, indicating its efficiency in capturing relevant phenotypic information.\n\nThe correlation scores for each ASD term mapping to the DSM-5 criteria were obtained through cosine similarity values from embedding analysis. This metric helps in understanding how well our terms align with established diagnostic guidelines.\n\nOverall, the performance metrics reported in our study are comprehensive and representative of the current literature. They include both quantitative measures, such as the number of identified terms and clustering accuracy, and qualitative assessments, such as alignment with DSM-5 criteria. These metrics collectively demonstrate the robustness and utility of our ASD phenotype terminology set in clinical and research settings.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we did not perform a direct comparison with publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. However, we did compare our terminology set's performance with another existing ASD terminology list, specifically Lingren's list. This comparison was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of our terminology set in differentiating ASD patients from non-ASD psychiatric patients.\n\nWe selected 2000 ASD patients and 2000 non-ASD psychiatric patients whose clinical notes contained the most ASD phenotypic concept information. Using our terminology set, we were able to cluster ASD patients more effectively than with Lingren's list. The t-SNE plot demonstrated that ASD patients were mostly clustered in the lower half of the plot, while non-ASD psychiatric patients were clustered in the upper half. Additionally, we observed four distinct subgroups of ASD patients, although one subgroup was mixed with non-ASD psychiatric patients.\n\nIn contrast, Lingren's list did not show clear cluster patterns. Only a fraction of patients in both ASD and non-ASD groups contained features from Lingren's list, whereas our terminology set identified ASD terms in a larger number of patients. This suggests that our terminology set is more efficient in identifying ASD patients' phenotypes and provides better separation between ASD patients and general psychiatric patients.\n\nWhile we did not use simpler baselines for direct comparison, the comparison with Lingren's list served as a practical evaluation of our methodology's effectiveness in real-world clinical data. This approach allowed us to demonstrate the utility of our terminology set in characterizing ASD phenotypes and mapping them to DSM-5 criteria.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our methodology involved several statistical analyses to ensure the robustness and significance of our findings. We calculated odds ratios for each ASD phenotype term, comparing the ASD cohort against both nonpsychiatric and psychiatric (non-ASD) cohorts. This allowed us to identify terms that were significantly more likely to appear in the ASD cohort, indicating their potential association with ASD.\n\nTo further validate our terminology set, we used the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) method to transform the data matrix and performed nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) for patient clustering. The results were visualized using t-SNE plots, which demonstrated distinct clustering patterns for ASD and non-ASD psychiatric patients. These clusters were statistically significant, showing that our terminology set effectively separates ASD patients from general psychiatric patients.\n\nWe also compared our terminology set with an existing published ASD vocabulary developed by Lingren et al. The results showed that our set provided better separation and clustering of ASD patients, suggesting its superiority in identifying ASD phenotypes.\n\nAdditionally, we performed cross-validation using BioBERT's NER algorithm to identify novel ASD terms and verify them against a gold standard set. This process ensured that our terminology set was comprehensive and accurate, with high confidence in the identified terms.\n\nStatistical significance was assessed throughout the study, and confidence intervals were considered where applicable. The use of multiple cohorts and rigorous quality control measures further strengthened the confidence in our results. Overall, the evaluation metrics and statistical analyses provide strong evidence supporting the superiority of our methodology in distinguishing ASD patients and mapping their phenotypes to DSM-5 criteria.",
  "evaluation/availability": "The raw evaluation files, specifically the high-quality clinical notes used in our study, are not publicly available due to patient privacy and institutional policies. However, the methodology and results of our analysis are thoroughly detailed in the publication, allowing for reproducibility. The study was conducted using data from the Epic Clarity database of the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, and the institutional review board approved the research. While the specific clinical notes cannot be shared, the processes and tools used, such as the CLAMP and BioBERT NLP pipelines, are well-documented and can be applied to similar datasets with appropriate ethical considerations and permissions. The ontology structure developed for ASD phenotype terms is visualized using Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, an open-source software, and can be accessed or replicated by researchers interested in ontology visualization. The terminology set and the methods for identifying ASD phenotype terms are designed to be generalizable, encouraging further research and validation in different clinical settings."
