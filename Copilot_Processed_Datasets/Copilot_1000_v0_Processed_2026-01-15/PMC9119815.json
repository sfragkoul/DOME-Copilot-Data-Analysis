  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from electronic health records (EHRs) of general practitioners (GPs) in the Vale of York. The data was pseudo-anonymized and included patient-level information such as age, sex, and socioeconomic status, measured by the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD). The primary care use data encompassed the rate of patient contacts, which were stratified into face-to-face consultations, telephone contacts, and letters sent to patients. Additionally, data on GP referrals, both to community services and secondary care, were collected as secondary outcome measures.\n\nA total of 382 patients were initially recruited between August 2015 and November 2018. However, 19 patients were excluded due to death or moving GP practices, leaving 363 patients for the analysis. These patients were divided into two groups: 253 in the intervention arm and 110 in the control arm. All included patients had complete data for the 2-year follow-up post-randomization.\n\nThe data used in this study has not been previously published or used by the community in other studies. The study design involved a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a 2:1 ratio in favor of the intervention group. The intervention group received a telephone-based case-management program, while the control group received standard care. The detailed patient-level data allowed for a comprehensive evaluation of the impact on specific aspects of primary care use over time.",
  "dataset/splits": "The study involved a single data split, focusing on patients at high risk of emergency department usage. A total of 363 patients were included in the analysis, with 253 patients assigned to the intervention arm and 110 patients to the control arm. The intervention group received a 6-month case-management program, while the control group received standard care. The data was collected over a 2-year follow-up period post-randomisation. Both groups were comparable in terms of age, sex, and socioeconomic status. The mean age was 71 years in the intervention arm and 72 years in the control arm. Approximately 24% of the patients in the intervention arm were aged 80 years or older, compared to 33% in the control arm. Half of the patients in both arms were from the most deprived socioeconomic group.",

  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several key steps. Pseudo-anonymized data were extracted from general practitioner electronic health records, including patient demographics such as age, sex, and socioeconomic status, as well as primary care use metrics. These metrics were stratified into different types of patient contacts, including face-to-face consultations, telephone calls, and letters sent to patients. Additionally, data on general practitioner referrals were collected, subclassified into community or secondary care referrals.\n\nThe data were collected over a period of 6 months before and 2 years following the intervention. This temporal data allowed for a detailed analysis of changes in primary care use over time. The primary care events were encoded and analyzed using Poisson regression models to calculate the monthly rates of primary care use. These models were used to compare the intervention and control arms, as well as to explore differences in primary care use across various patient demographics, including age, sex, and socioeconomic status.\n\nThe data preprocessing also involved stratifying the monthly rate of all primary care events by age and sex to observe how specific types of primary care use changed over time. This stratification helped in understanding if trends were similar across different demographic groups. All analyses were conducted according to intention-to-treat principles, ensuring that the data reflected the real-world application of the intervention.",

  "model/output": "The model utilized in this study is a regression model, specifically Poisson regression. This type of model is appropriate for analyzing count data, such as the number of primary care events per patient. Poisson regression was employed to calculate the annual rate of all primary care events for both the intervention and control arms. It was also used to estimate incident rate ratios (IRRs) to compare the rates between the two arms. Additionally, separate Poisson models were used to examine the rates of different types of primary care events, including face-to-face consultations, telephone calls, letters sent, and community and secondary care referrals. These models helped to provide a detailed understanding of how the intervention affected various aspects of primary care use over time. The granular nature of the data allowed for comprehensive evaluation, and the use of Poisson regression facilitated the comparison of event rates between the intervention and control groups.",

  "model/availability": "Not applicable",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method employed a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design to comprehensively assess the impact on specific aspects of primary care use. This design allowed for a comparison with a control group, ensuring that randomisation and intention-to-treat analysis minimized bias and maintained comparability between the intervention and control arms.\n\nThe study utilized routinely collected data, which, while potentially varying in accuracy and completeness, affected both arms equally. The 2-year follow-up period enabled the examination of trends over time and the sustainability of any observed effects. The large sample size facilitated the analysis of effects by patient demographics and types of primary care use.\n\nStatistical analyses included Poisson regression to calculate the annual rate of all primary care events and incident rate ratios (IRRs) to compare rates between the two arms. Separate Poisson models were used to examine different aspects of general practitioner (GP) workload, such as face-to-face consultations, telephone calls, letters, and community and secondary care referrals. Further analyses stratified the annual rate of all primary care events by age, sex, and socioeconomic status to explore differences across specific patient groups.\n\nMonthly rates of primary care events were also compared over time using Poisson regression, with monthly IRRs estimated to compare each arm. These analyses were repeated for different types of primary care contacts to provide a detailed understanding of the intervention's effects. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the findings, confirming that excluding follow-up data from March 2020 did not alter the results.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we focused on evaluating the impact of a case-management intervention on primary care use through several key performance metrics. The primary outcome measure was the annual rate of all primary care events, which included face-to-face consultations, telephone contacts, letters sent to patients, and referrals to community or secondary care services. These metrics were chosen to provide a comprehensive view of how the intervention affected various aspects of primary care workload.\n\nWe reported the event rates per person per year for both the intervention and control groups, along with incident rate ratios (IRRs) to compare these rates between the two groups. This allowed us to assess whether the intervention led to any significant changes in primary care use. Additionally, we conducted stratified analyses by age, sex, and socioeconomic status to determine if the effects of the intervention varied across different patient subgroups.\n\nThe metrics used in our study are representative of those commonly reported in the literature on case-management interventions. Previous studies have often focused on similar outcomes, such as the frequency of primary care contacts and referrals. For instance, some studies have examined the impact of case-management on emergency department attendances and hospital admissions, while others have looked at the use of primary care services more broadly. Our choice of metrics aligns with this existing body of research, ensuring that our findings can be compared and contrasted with other studies in the field.\n\nOne notable finding from our study was the significant reduction in referrals to secondary care services among patients in the intervention group. This metric is particularly important as it reflects the broader impact of the intervention on healthcare utilization and resource allocation. The reduction in secondary care referrals suggests that the case-management intervention may have helped to manage patients' needs more effectively within the primary care setting, potentially leading to more efficient use of healthcare resources.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics reported in our study are comprehensive and representative of those used in the literature. They provide valuable insights into the impact of the case-management intervention on primary care use and highlight the potential benefits of such interventions in improving healthcare delivery and resource utilization.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we did not perform a direct comparison to publicly available methods or benchmark datasets, as our focus was on evaluating the impact of a specific case-management intervention within a real-world clinical setting. Instead, we employed a robust randomized controlled trial (RCT) design to ensure rigorous evaluation.\n\nWe did, however, include a control group that received standard care, which served as a baseline for comparison. This control group allowed us to assess the effects of our intervention relative to usual care practices. The use of intention-to-treat analysis further strengthened our comparison by including all randomized patients in the analysis according to their initial group assignment, regardless of whether they completed the intervention.\n\nAdditionally, we conducted sensitivity analyses to examine the robustness of our findings. For instance, we assessed the impact of excluding follow-up data from the COVID-19 pandemic period to ensure that our results were not unduly influenced by changes in healthcare delivery and patient behavior during that time.\n\nWhile we did not compare our methods to simpler baselines in the traditional sense, our study design inherently included a comparison to standard care, which can be considered a simpler baseline approach. This design allowed us to evaluate the added value of our intervention beyond what is typically provided in primary care settings.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The study employed a robust randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, which inherently provides a high level of confidence in the evaluation of the Health Navigator intervention. The use of intention-to-treat analysis and a 2-year follow-up period further strengthens the reliability of the findings.\n\nThe performance metrics presented in the study include confidence intervals, which are crucial for understanding the precision of the estimates. For instance, the incident rate ratios (IRRs) for different types of primary care events are accompanied by 95% confidence intervals, allowing for a clear assessment of the statistical significance and the range within which the true effect lies.\n\nStatistical significance is a key aspect of the evaluation. The study reports p-values for various comparisons, indicating whether the observed differences between the intervention and control groups are likely to have occurred by chance. For example, the reduction in secondary care referrals in the intervention arm is statistically significant (P<0.001), suggesting a strong evidence that the intervention had a meaningful impact on this outcome.\n\nThe study also conducted sensitivity analyses to address potential confounding factors, such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These analyses help to ensure that the observed effects are robust and not merely artifacts of external influences.\n\nOverall, the combination of a rigorous study design, comprehensive statistical analysis, and consideration of potential biases contributes to a high level of confidence in the evaluation of the Health Navigator intervention. The inclusion of confidence intervals and statistically significant results further supports the claim that the method is effective and superior to the baseline.",
