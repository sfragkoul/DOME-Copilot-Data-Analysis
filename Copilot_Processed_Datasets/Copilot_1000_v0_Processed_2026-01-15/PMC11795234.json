  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset utilized in this study was sourced from multiple datasets, including the TCGA-LUAD dataset and the GSE68465 dataset. The TCGA-LUAD dataset was used as the training group, while the GSE68465 dataset served as the validation group. Additionally, the study included 112 tumor samples classified into the mutation group, 403 tumor samples into the wild-type group, and 59 normal pulmonary tissues into the normal group. These samples were obtained from patients diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma across 17 datasets. The study also utilized data from the cBioPortal website for mutation information. The datasets were analyzed using various computational tools and packages in R, such as 'limma' for identifying differentially expressed genes and 'ESTIMATE' for evaluating immune and stromal cell levels in tumor tissues. The study aimed to construct a prognostic model based on these datasets, which was validated using leave-one-out cross-validation and consistency index calculations. The datasets have been previously used in the community for similar analyses, and the study builds upon this existing work to provide new insights into lung adenocarcinoma prognosis and treatment.",
  "dataset/splits": "In our study, we utilized two primary datasets for the analysis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). The first dataset, TCGA-LUAD, was used as the training group. The second dataset, GSE68465, served as the validation group. The TCGA-LUAD dataset included a substantial number of samples, which were used to develop and train our prognostic model. The GSE68465 dataset, on the other hand, was employed to validate the performance and generalizability of the model constructed from the TCGA-LUAD dataset.\n\nThe distribution of data points in each dataset was carefully considered to ensure robust training and validation. The TCGA-LUAD dataset was utilized to screen candidate genes using univariate Cox analysis, followed by the construction of a prognostic model through a leave-one-out cross-validation framework. This approach involved 101 combinations of algorithms to build the model, ensuring comprehensive evaluation and optimization.\n\nThe validation group, GSE68465, was used to calculate the consistency index (C-index) of each model, providing a measure of the model's predictive accuracy. This split allowed us to assess the model's performance on an independent dataset, thereby enhancing the reliability of our findings.\n\nIn summary, our study involved two main data splits: the TCGA-LUAD dataset for training and the GSE68465 dataset for validation. This bifurcation enabled a thorough evaluation of the prognostic model's effectiveness and its potential application in clinical settings.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The study utilized two primary datasets: TCGA-LUAD and GSE68465. The TCGA-LUAD dataset was designated as the training group, while the GSE68465 dataset served as the validation group. This split ensured that the training and test sets were independent, allowing for a robust evaluation of the prognostic model's performance.\n\nTo enforce independence, the datasets were used separately in different stages of the analysis. The TCGA-LUAD dataset was used for initial screening of candidate genes through univariate Cox analysis and for constructing the prognostic model using a leave-one-out cross-validation framework. The GSE68465 dataset was then used to validate the model, calculating the consistency index (C-index) to assess its predictive accuracy.\n\nThe distribution of these datasets aligns with previously published machine learning datasets in the field of oncology. The use of independent training and validation sets is a standard practice to prevent data leakage and to ensure that the model's performance is generalizable to new, unseen data.

  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed a robust methodology to ensure that our prognostic model was neither overfitted nor underfitted. The number of parameters in our model was indeed larger than the number of training points, which is a common scenario in high-dimensional genomic data. To address this, we utilized a leave-one-out cross-validation framework. This approach involved constructing 101 different combinations of algorithms and evaluating each model's performance using the consistency index (C-index). By doing so, we ensured that our model's performance was assessed on a diverse set of validation sets, reducing the risk of overfitting.\n\nTo further mitigate overfitting, we employed stringent criteria for identifying differentially expressed genes. We used the 'limma' package in R to identify genes with a log2 fold-change greater than 1 and a P-value less than 0.05. This ensured that only genes with significant and substantial expression differences were included in our model.\n\nAdditionally, we performed univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses to identify independent prognostic factors. This step helped in selecting the most relevant genes and clinical characteristics, thereby reducing the complexity of the model and preventing overfitting.\n\nTo rule out underfitting, we constructed a nomogram that integrated risk scores and important clinical parameters.
