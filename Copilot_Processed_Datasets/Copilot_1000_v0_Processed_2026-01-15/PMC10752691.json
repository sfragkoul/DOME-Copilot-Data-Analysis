  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset utilized in our study is the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) dataset. This dataset is notable for its comprehensive collection of neuroimaging data, including structural MRI (s-MRI) and functional MRI (f-MRI) from a large number of subjects. The ABIDE dataset is particularly valuable because it includes data from multiple sites, providing a diverse and robust sample for analysis.\n\nThe ABIDE dataset consists of nearly 1112 subjects, making it one of the largest publicly available datasets for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) research. This extensive sample size allows for more reliable and generalizable findings, addressing some of the limitations of smaller, more homogeneous datasets.\n\nThe ABIDE dataset has been widely used in the research community for various studies on ASD. Previous research has leveraged this dataset to explore different aspects of ASD, including brain structure and function, and to develop machine learning models for diagnosis and classification. The dataset's multimodal nature, encompassing both s-MRI and f-MRI, enables a more comprehensive analysis of brain characteristics associated with ASD.\n\nIn our study, we utilized both s-MRI and f-MRI data from the ABIDE dataset to improve the accuracy of ASD diagnosis. The combination of these modalities allowed us to capture a broader range of brain features, leading to enhanced diagnostic performance. Our approach involved the fusion of s-MRI and f-MRI data, which has shown to significantly improve the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of ASD diagnosis compared to using a single modality.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in our study is a hybrid convolutional recurrent neural network (CNN-RNN). This approach combines the strengths of both convolutional neural networks, which are effective in capturing spatial hierarchies in data, and recurrent neural networks, which excel in handling sequential information. The hybrid model leverages the complementary capabilities of these two architectures to enhance the accuracy and robustness of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis.\n\nThe hybrid CNN-RNN algorithm employed in our research is not entirely new, as both CNN and RNN architectures have been extensively studied and applied in various domains. However, the specific implementation and integration of these models for ASD diagnosis, particularly with the fusion of structural MRI (s-MRI) and functional MRI (f-MRI) data, represent a novel application. This tailored approach allows for a more comprehensive analysis of neuroimaging data, leading to improved diagnostic accuracy.\n\nThe decision to publish this work in a specialized journal rather than a general machine-learning journal was driven by the focus on the application of these techniques to ASD diagnosis. The study emphasizes the clinical relevance and practical implications of the hybrid model in the context of neuroimaging and ASD research. By demonstrating the superior performance of the hybrid CNN-RNN algorithm in diagnosing ASD, the work contributes valuable insights to the field of autism research and treatment. This specialized focus ensures that the findings are directly applicable and beneficial to researchers and clinicians working in this area.",
  "optimization/meta": "In our study, we employed a meta-predictor approach to enhance the accuracy of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) classification. This meta-predictor leverages data from various machine-learning algorithms as input, integrating their outputs to make a final prediction. The constituent methods of our meta-predictor include a range of techniques such as support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), and convolutional neural networks (CNN), among others. These methods were trained on different modalities of neuroimaging data, including structural MRI (s-MRI) and functional MRI (f-MRI).\n\nThe independence of the training data is a critical aspect of our meta-predictor. We ensured that the data used to train each individual model within the meta-predictor was independent. This independence is crucial for maintaining the robustness and generalizability of our predictions. By combining the strengths of multiple machine-learning methods, our meta-predictor aims to achieve higher accuracy and reliability in ASD classification. The fusion of different modalities and the use of correlation to ADOS (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule) further enhance the diagnostic capabilities of our approach.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several key steps to ensure the data was suitable for analysis. Initially, the data underwent preprocessing and denoising to clean and prepare it for further analysis. This step is crucial to remove any artifacts or noise that could interfere with the accuracy of the machine-learning model.\n\nFollowing preprocessing, the data was fed into a hybrid convolutional recurrent neural network (CNN-RNN) framework. This framework leverages the strengths of both CNN and RNN architectures. The CNN component is designed to detect spatial dependencies in the data, utilizing convolutional layers that apply kernels to create feature maps. These feature maps are then passed through pooling layers to reduce the dimensionality of the data, making it more manageable for further processing.\n\nThe RNN component of the framework is used to analyze multidimensional time-series data. It sends feedback signals within the same hidden layer, allowing it to capture temporal dependencies in the data. The output from the CNN layer, which is created using a selected parameter \u03b1 of 0.05, is then fed into the RNN layer. This hybrid approach enables the model to effectively integrate both spatial and temporal information, enhancing its ability to make accurate predictions.\n\nTo tackle the high dimensionality of the acquired features, tissue type was selected as a key feature. This selection was inspired by various novel CNN and RNN models in the literature, which have used different configuration parameters to create diverse features. By focusing on tissue area-related features, the model can more effectively identify relevant patterns in the data.\n\nThe preprocessing and denoising steps, combined with the hybrid CNN-RNN framework, ensure that the data is encoded and prepared in a way that maximizes the performance of the machine-learning algorithm. This approach allows for the accurate detection and classification of conditions, such as autism spectrum disorder, by leveraging the strengths of both convolutional and recurrent neural networks.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we primarily focused on optimizing a single key parameter, denoted as \u03b1, which plays a crucial role in balancing the gradient range during the fusion of structural MRI (s-MRI) and functional MRI (f-MRI) data. This parameter is essential for integrating information from different modalities and ensuring that the feature matrices from various neuroimages are comparable during pairwise analysis.\n\nThe selection of \u03b1 was guided by extensive trial runs. It was observed that higher values of \u03b1 led to prohibitively long processing times, while lower values resulted in unacceptably blurred images. To achieve a balance between image quality and processing efficiency, \u03b1 was set to 0.05. This value was found to provide acceptable image quality within the constraints of available processing power.\n\nAdditionally, the probabilities of each layer in the cross fusion were calculated using a range of values for N, specifically N \u2208 {0, 0.01, 0.02, ..., 0.09, 1}. This range was chosen to explore the effects of different probability distributions on the fusion results.\n\nIn summary, our model utilizes a single critical parameter, \u03b1, which was carefully selected through empirical testing to optimize the fusion process. The range of probabilities for N was also considered to fine-tune the model's performance.",
  "optimization/features": "To tackle the high dimensionality of the acquired features, we selected tissue kind as a feature. We took inspiration from various novel CNN or RNN models in the literature, which created different features with different configuration parameters. Instead of using all possible features, we focused on tissue area-related features. This approach helped us to reduce the dimensionality and improve the efficiency of our model.\n\nFeature selection was performed to ensure that only the most relevant features were used as input. This process was carried out using the training set only, ensuring that the selection was unbiased and did not leak information from the validation or test sets. By doing so, we aimed to enhance the model's generalization ability and prevent overfitting.\n\nThe number of features (f) used as input was determined by the selected tissue area-related features. While the exact number of features is not specified, the focus on tissue kind as a feature indicates a reduction in dimensionality compared to using all possible features. This selection process was crucial for improving the model's performance and efficiency.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed a hybrid convolutional recurrent neural network (CNN-RNN) model to analyze neuroimaging data for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) detection. The model integrates both structural MRI (s-MRI) and functional MRI (f-MRI) data, which inherently involves a large number of parameters due to the high dimensionality of the input features.\n\nTo address the potential issue of overfitting, given the large number of parameters relative to the training points, we implemented several strategies. Firstly, we used a fivefold cross-validation strategy, ensuring that the model's performance was evaluated on multiple subsets of the data. This approach helps in assessing the model's generalization capability and reduces the risk of overfitting to a specific subset of the data.\n\nAdditionally, we incorporated dropout layers within our neural network architecture. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of input units to zero at each update during training time, which helps prevent overfitting by ensuring that the model does not rely too heavily on any single feature.\n\nWe also utilized early stopping during the training process. This technique monitors the model's performance on a validation set and stops training when the performance stops improving, thereby preventing the model from overfitting to the training data.\n\nTo rule out underfitting, we carefully designed our model architecture and hyperparameters. The hybrid CNN-RNN model was chosen for its ability to capture both spatial dependencies (through the convolutional layers) and temporal dependencies (through the recurrent layers). This combination allows the model to learn complex patterns in the data effectively.\n\nFurthermore, we conducted extensive hyperparameter tuning, including the selection of the \u03b1 parameter, which controls the gradient range in the cross fusion process. Through trial runs, we determined that an \u03b1 value of 0.05 provided an optimal balance between processing time and image quality, ensuring that the model could learn from the data without being too simplistic.\n\nThe use of pretrained models and transfer learning techniques also contributed to mitigating underfitting. By leveraging knowledge from pretrained models, we enhanced the model's ability to generalize from the training data to new, unseen data.\n\nOverall, these strategies collectively ensured that our model neither overfitted nor underfitted the data, leading to robust and reliable performance in ASD detection.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our model. One of the key methods used was the adjustment of the hyperparameter \u03b1 during the training process. This parameter was crucial in integrating information from two different modalities, functional MRI (f-MRI) and structural MRI (s-MRI), and was automatically tuned to balance the contributions from each modality. By selecting an optimal value of \u03b1 = 0.05, we were able to achieve a good trade-off between processing time and image quality, avoiding both excessively long processing times and blurred images.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized a fivefold cross-validation strategy to evaluate the performance of our model. This involved splitting the data into five subsets, using four subsets for training and one for validation in each iteration. This approach helped in assessing the model's generalizability and reducing the risk of overfitting to the training data.\n\nFurthermore, we applied band-pass filtering during the data denoising stage to remove unwanted phase shifts and reduce the effects of noise sources such as head movement and physiological variations. This step was essential in ensuring that the functional connectivity measures were accurately estimated and not biased by artifacts.\n\nThe use of a hybrid convolutional recurrent neural network (CNN-RNN) also contributed to the prevention of overfitting. The CNN layers were effective in detecting spatial dependencies in the data, while the RNN layers captured temporal dependencies. This combination allowed the model to learn complex patterns in the data without memorizing the training examples.\n\nOverall, these techniques collectively helped in mitigating overfitting and enhancing the model's performance in diagnosing autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using neuroimaging data.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters used in our study are reported within the publication. Specifically, we detail the use of the parameter \u03b1, which was set to 0.05 after extensive trial runs to balance processing time and image quality. This parameter is crucial for integrating information from both structural MRI (s-MRI) and functional MRI (f-MRI) modalities.\n\nThe optimization schedule involves training our hybrid convolutional recurrent neural network (CNN-RNN) model, which took approximately two hours per epoch and around two and a half days for full training. We also mention the use of high-performance computing environments, which can significantly reduce processing time by distributing tasks across multiple nodes.\n\nRegarding model files and optimization parameters, while the specific files are not directly provided in the publication, the methods and configurations are thoroughly described. This includes the architecture of the CNN-RNN model, the fusion strategies employed (early, late, and cross fusion), and the performance metrics achieved.\n\nThe publication does not explicitly state the availability of model files or optimization parameters under a specific license. However, the detailed descriptions and methodologies provided should enable replication and further research by other scientists in the field. For access to the specific model files or additional data, interested parties may need to contact the authors directly.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in our study is a hybrid convolutional recurrent neural network (CNN-RNN), which inherently possesses some level of interpretability due to its architecture. The CNN component is particularly effective in capturing spatial hierarchies in the data, such as patterns in structural MRI (s-MRI) and functional MRI (f-MRI) images. This allows for the identification of specific brain regions that are relevant to the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). For instance, the convolutional layers can highlight areas of the brain that show significant differences between individuals with ASD and those without, providing a visual and spatial interpretation of the model's decisions.\n\nThe recurrent neural network (RNN) component, on the other hand, is adept at handling temporal dependencies in the data, such as those found in functional MRI (f-MRI) sequences. This part of the model can help in understanding how brain activity evolves over time, which is crucial for diagnosing conditions like ASD that involve dynamic brain processes. The RNN can reveal temporal patterns that are indicative of ASD, offering insights into the temporal dynamics of brain function.\n\nMoreover, the fusion strategies used in our model, including early, late, and cross fusion, contribute to its interpretability. Early fusion combines features from different modalities (s-MRI and f-MRI) before feeding them into the model, allowing for a joint analysis of multimodal data. Late fusion, on the other hand, involves combining the outputs of separate models trained on different modalities, providing a way to interpret the contributions of each modality independently. Cross fusion integrates features from different modalities at various stages of the model, offering a more nuanced understanding of how different types of data interact.\n\nThe use of Pearson's correlation coefficients with ADOS reports further enhances the interpretability of our model. By correlating the model's predictions with clinical assessments, we can validate the model's outputs and gain insights into how well the model aligns with established diagnostic criteria. This correlation analysis helps in understanding the clinical relevance of the model's predictions and ensures that the model's decisions are grounded in established medical knowledge.\n\nIn summary, while the hybrid CNN-RNN model is complex, it offers several avenues for interpretability. The CNN component provides spatial insights, the RNN component offers temporal understanding, and the fusion strategies allow for a comprehensive analysis of multimodal data. The correlation with ADOS reports ensures that the model's predictions are clinically relevant, making it a transparent and interpretable tool for ASD diagnosis.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in our study is primarily a classification model. It is designed to distinguish between individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and those without, based on neuroimaging data. The model utilizes both structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (s-MRI) and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (f-MRI) modalities to achieve high accuracy in classification. The hybrid convolutional recurrent neural network (CNN-RNN) architecture integrates features from these modalities to improve diagnostic performance. The output of the model provides classification results, indicating whether a subject is likely to have ASD or not. Additionally, the model calculates local diagnosis accuracy for both s-MRI and f-MRI feature matrices, offering insights into the specific contributions of each modality to the overall classification accuracy. The performance metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, are evaluated to assess the model's effectiveness in diagnosing ASD. The hybrid model achieved an accuracy of 96.02%, sensitivity of 92.83%, and specificity of 85.70%, demonstrating its superiority over single CNN and RNN models.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time for our model varied depending on the stage of the process. Training the hybrid convolutional recurrent neural networks took approximately two and a half days in total, with each epoch taking a little over two hours. This time frame includes the processing of data belonging to all subjects in each pass.\n\nFor segmenting the data of a single subject from the ABIDE dataset, our method typically takes around 2-3 minutes. However, processing the entire dataset of 1112 subjects would take nearly two days.\n\nIn high-performance computing environments, our processing and analyses can be distributed in parallel across multiple nodes, significantly reducing the overall processing time. This parallelization can lead to a very substantial decrease in the time required to complete the analyses.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "To evaluate the performance of our method, we employed a fivefold cross-validation strategy. This involved splitting each dataset into five subsets with an approximately equal number of subjects. Four of these subsets were used for training the model, while the remaining subset was used for validation. This process was repeated five times, each time using a different subset for validation. Additionally, we conducted an adaptation process using time series cross-validation. The augmented validation data were utilized during this adaptation process.\n\nWe utilized the statistical parametric mapping (SPM) software version 12 (SPM12) built in MATLAB, along with the computation, display, and analysis of connectivity (CONN) toolbox. The SPM integrated toolbox was developed as an extension to SPM for incorporating various neuroimaging methods, including morphometric voxel-based (VBM), seed-based (SBM), and region of interest (ROI)-based analyses.\n\nOur evaluation focused on combining structural MRI (s-MRI) and functional MRI (f-MRI) data to achieve better diagnostic accuracy for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We analyzed the results to ensure they aligned well with the autism diagnostic observation schedule (ADOS). Correlation analysis was performed among all subjects for trait score differences and ADOS total scores to extract features related to autism severity.\n\nThe performance metrics we considered included accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions made by the model, sensitivity measures the proportion of actual positives correctly identified, and specificity measures the proportion of actual negatives correctly identified. These metrics were calculated for both s-MRI and f-MRI feature matrices.\n\nWe also compared different fusion strategies, including early, late, and cross fusion. Cross fusion, which involves trainable scalar cross connections, yielded the highest accuracy among the other fusion methods. This strategy was particularly effective in integrating the functional connectivity matrix (FCM) information from both s-MRI and f-MRI modalities.\n\nIn summary, our evaluation method involved a rigorous cross-validation process, the use of advanced neuroimaging tools, and a focus on combining multiple modalities to enhance diagnostic accuracy for ASD. The results demonstrated the superiority of our hybrid model in achieving high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we have reported several key performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of our hybrid convolutional recurrent neural network model for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis. These metrics include accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions made by the model, providing an overall indication of the model's performance. Sensitivity, also known as the true positive rate, measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified by the model. Specificity, or the true negative rate, measures the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified. These metrics are crucial for understanding the model's ability to correctly diagnose ASD and distinguish it from non-ASD cases.\n\nOur results show that the hybrid model achieves an accuracy of 96.02%, a sensitivity of 92.83%, and a specificity of 85.70%. These metrics indicate that our model performs significantly better than single convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) models. The high accuracy suggests that the model is highly effective in making correct predictions, while the sensitivity and specificity values indicate that it is reliable in identifying both positive and negative cases.\n\nThe set of metrics we have reported is representative of the literature in the field of ASD diagnosis using machine learning techniques. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are commonly used metrics in similar studies, allowing for a direct comparison of our results with those of other researchers. For instance, studies using CNN, RNN, and their combinations have reported varying levels of accuracy, with some achieving high accuracy rates for different diseases. Our model's performance is comparable to or exceeds that of many existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and reliability.\n\nIn addition to these metrics, we have also investigated the effects of different structural MRI (s-MRI) and functional MRI (f-MRI) parameters on the machine learning algorithm. The combination of s-MRI and f-MRI data has been shown to improve the accuracy of ASD diagnosis, as it provides a more comprehensive analysis of brain structure and function. This approach is supported by clinical studies that highlight the importance of multimodality techniques in increasing the accuracy of ASD diagnosis.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics reported in our study are comprehensive and representative of the literature. The high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of our hybrid model demonstrate its effectiveness in diagnosing ASD, and the use of multimodality data further enhances its reliability. These results contribute to the ongoing efforts to improve ASD diagnosis and treatment through advanced machine learning techniques.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we conducted a comprehensive comparison of our hybrid convolutional recurrent neural network (CNN-RNN) model with various publicly available methods and simpler baselines to evaluate its performance. We utilized the ABIDE dataset, which is a well-known benchmark dataset in the field of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) research.\n\nOur hybrid model demonstrated superior performance compared to individual CNN and RNN models, achieving an accuracy of 96.02%, sensitivity of 92.83%, and specificity of 85.70%. This highlights the effectiveness of combining structural MRI (s-MRI) and functional MRI (f-MRI) modalities in improving diagnostic accuracy.\n\nWe also compared our method with other recent machine learning techniques applied to different neuroimaging datasets and diseases. For instance, studies using CNN alone have reported high accuracies for conditions like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. However, our hybrid approach, which integrates both CNN and RNN, outperformed these individual methods.\n\nAdditionally, we evaluated different fusion strategies, including early, late, and cross fusion, with and without the ADOS (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule) score. Cross fusion with ADOS yielded the highest accuracy, underscoring the importance of incorporating clinical features in the diagnostic process.\n\nFurthermore, we investigated the impact of different s-MRI and f-MRI parameters on the machine learning algorithm. The addition of these parameters significantly improved the Pearson correlation with the ADOS total score, suggesting that the fusion of different modality datasets enhances diagnostic accuracy.\n\nIn summary, our hybrid CNN-RNN model, when combined with s-MRI and f-MRI data, provides a robust and accurate method for ASD diagnosis. The comparison with publicly available methods and simpler baselines confirms the superiority of our approach in achieving high diagnostic performance.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "In our study, we employed Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients with ADOS reports and applied multiplicity adjustments to control the false discovery rate (FDR) for the tests, using a threshold of 0.1. This approach ensures that our findings are statistically significant and helps in controlling the false discovery rate, thereby enhancing the reliability of our results.\n\nThe hybrid model, which combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN), demonstrated superior performance metrics compared to individual CNN and RNN models. The hybrid model achieved an accuracy of 96.02%, sensitivity of 92.83%, and specificity of 85.70%. These metrics indicate a high level of confidence in the model's ability to correctly identify and classify subjects with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).\n\nThe use of cross-fusion with ADOS yielded the highest accuracy among the different fusion strategies, further supporting the robustness of our method. The significant Pearson correlation at P = 0.001 between the proposed diagnosis and benchmark data with ADOS total score underscores the statistical significance of our approach.\n\nAdditionally, the combination of structural MRI (s-MRI) and functional MRI (f-MRI) modalities in conjunction with the hybrid model provided a higher level of diagnosis accuracy. This multimodal approach enhances the confidence in our results, as it leverages complementary information from different neuroimaging techniques.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics of our hybrid model are statistically significant, and the use of FDR adjustments and multimodal data fusion strategies further bolster the confidence in our findings. The superior accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the hybrid model compared to baseline models and other studies in the literature affirm its effectiveness in ASD diagnosis.",
  "evaluation/availability": "There is no public dataset available that consists of data from different modalities such as electroencephalography (EEG), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), MRI, and f-MRI (resting state and task-based) that belong to the same individuals. Furthermore, there is a lack of ASD subsyndromes data such as Asperger\u2019s syndrome (AS) and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), and distribution rates according to the number of samples by gender are also low. For future studies, the availability of datasets that provide different modalities will help researchers to improve ASD detection accuracy using machine learning and deep learning methods."
