  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study originates from a cohort of symptomatic subjects who were referred for subspecialty pulmonary examination between October 1, 2001, and March 10, 2008. These subjects underwent specialized pulmonary function testing. The parent cohort consisted of 96 cases of World Trade Center Lung Injury (WTC-LI) and 127 controls. Cases of WTC-LI were defined as individuals with FEV1, %Pred (forced expiratory volume in one second, percent predicted) less than the lower limit of normal (LLN) at the time of the subspecialty pulmonary examination. Controls were selected based on having FEV1, %Pred greater than or equal to the LLN.\n\nFor the metabolome assessment, a subset of this cohort was chosen. This subset included 15 cases of WTC-LI and 15 controls, maintaining a 1:1 ratio. The selection criteria for this subset ensured stable case/control assignment based on the most recent spirometry measures from annual health physicals and the absence of a chronic sinusitis diagnosis.\n\nThe data used in this study includes demographic and clinical information obtained from the World Trade Center medical monitoring and treatment program. Exposure intensity was categorized based on the first arrival time at the World Trade Center site, and duration of exposure was defined as the time spent at the site performing rescue and recovery efforts. Additionally, serum samples collected within 200 days after September 11, 2001, were processed and stored for metabolomic quantification.\n\nThe dataset has been used in previous studies to understand the association between metabolic mediators and disease severity following toxin exposure. The metabolomic data provides a comprehensive snapshot of the physiological state of the subjects, which is crucial for identifying metabolic pathways and biomarkers associated with WTC-LI. The use of machine learning techniques, such as random forests, has allowed for the analysis of differential expression of individual metabolites and their interactions, revealing key phenotypic changes related to lung injury.",
  "dataset/splits": "Not applicable.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "Not enough information is available.",
  "dataset/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in our study is the ensemble learning method known as Random Forests (RF). This algorithm is not new; it has been established and widely used in various fields for its robustness and ability to handle high-dimensional data.\n\nRandom Forests was chosen for several reasons. Firstly, it is unbiased and performs well with datasets of sizes similar to ours. Secondly, it is non-parametric, meaning it does not make strong assumptions about the underlying data distribution. Additionally, RF rarely overfits the data, which is crucial for maintaining the model's generalizability.\n\nThe use of RF in our study is not about introducing a new machine-learning algorithm but rather about applying a well-established method to a specific biological context. The focus of our publication is on the metabolomic profiling of World Trade Center-exposed firefighters and the identification of metabolic pathways associated with lung injury. The machine-learning aspect is a tool to achieve this goal, rather than the primary innovation.\n\nGiven that the primary contribution of our work lies in the biological insights gained from the metabolomic analysis, the publication is more suited to a respiratory research journal rather than a machine-learning journal. The machine-learning techniques used are standard and have been extensively documented in the literature, so there was no need to publish them in a machine-learning context.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employed in this study is not a meta-predictor. It relies solely on the random forest (RF) algorithm for its machine learning approach. The RF method was chosen for its unbiased nature, robustness with datasets of similar sizes, non-parametric properties, and resistance to overfitting. The RF algorithm uses a large ensemble of decision trees to classify subjects, producing an unbiased estimate of model classification accuracy. It also measures each metabolite's importance to model classification accuracy through mean decrease accuracy, helping to focus on the most relevant metabolites for class differentiation.\n\nThe training data for the RF model consists of metabolomic profiles from serum samples collected within 200 days after the exposure event. The subjects were never-smoking, male firefighters exposed to World Trade Center particulate matter, segregated by post-exposure lung function. The model was trained to identify metabolites associated with World Trade Center Lung Injury (WTC-LI), with the goal of elucidating pathways of interest in the progression to WTC-LI and revealing clustering patterns reflective of mechanistic action.\n\nThe independence of the training data is assured by the study design, which includes subjects with stable case/control assignment ensured by most recent spirometry measures from annual health physicals and no chronic sinusitis diagnosis. This design helps to mitigate unknown effects due to differences in exposure and duration of exposure, as well as baseline differences in metabolic biomarkers. However, it is important to note that the findings have not been validated with an independent validation cohort, which would significantly strengthen the replicability and generalisability of the findings and methods.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure accurate and consistent identification of metabolites. Initially, quality control and curation were performed to remove system artifacts, misassignments, and background noise. Compounds were matched to library entries based on retention index, mass, and spectral data.\n\nQualified metabolites were those detected in 80% or more of subjects per group with a relative standard deviation of 15% or greater. Missing data in qualified metabolites were imputed using the minimum observed value of each compound.\n\nFor statistical analysis, continuous variables were expressed as median and interquartile range (IQR). Non-parametric Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare continuous data, while categorical data were summarized using counts and proportions, with Pearson \u03c7\u00b2 tests for comparison.\n\nThe curated data of the qualified metabolite profile were subjected to random forest (RF) analysis using the randomForest package in R (V.3.4.3). The RF model included the top 5% of metabolites important to class separation, as measured by mean decrease accuracy. This refined metabolite profile was then used to evaluate classification accuracy.\n\nTen replicates of each RF model were run to ensure stability, with the best model identified by the lowest estimated out-of-bag error rate. The RF models consisted of 10^6 and 10^3 trees for the qualified and refined profiles, respectively, with the number of metabolites in the profile sampled with replacement at each node.\n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) was implemented to view case/control separation in qualified metabolites compared with the machine-learning-generated refined profile. Each attribute was mean-centered, normalized, and projected onto the eigenbasis of the correlation matrix of all attributes. The number of components retained was determined based on analysis of the scree plot, and the variance explained by PCA was quantified as the summation of the percent total variance explained by the identified components.\n\nAdditionally, unsupervised two-way hierarchical clustering was performed on the refined profile\u2019s correlation matrix using Pearson correlation as a distance metric and average linkage. This comprehensive approach ensured that the data was appropriately encoded and preprocessed for the machine-learning algorithm, allowing for robust and reliable analysis.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the number of parameters used in the model varied depending on the stage of the analysis. Initially, we started with a qualified profile consisting of 580 metabolites. This number was determined by selecting metabolites that were detected in 80% or more of subjects per group with a relative standard deviation of 15% or greater. This initial set of metabolites was used to develop an initial random forest (RF) model.\n\nTo refine the model, we identified the top 5% of metabolites that were most important for class separation, as measured by mean decrease accuracy. This process resulted in a refined metabolite profile, which was then used to rerun the RF model. The refined profile consisted of a smaller subset of metabolites, specifically the top 5% from the initial set, which translates to approximately 29 metabolites (5% of 580).\n\nThe selection of the number of trees in the RF models was also carefully considered. For the qualified profile, we used 10^6 trees, while for the refined profile, we used 10^3 trees. The number of metabolites sampled with replacement at each node was set to the square root of the number of metabolites in the profile. This approach ensured that the model was robust and stable, as evidenced by running ten replicates of each RF model and selecting the best model based on the lowest estimated out-of-bag error rate.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we initially detected 765 metabolites, but only 580 qualified metabolites were included in further analysis. These qualified metabolites were subjected to a feature selection process using the random forest (RF) algorithm. The feature selection was performed to reduce the dimensionality of the data by identifying the metabolites most relevant to our outcome. Specifically, we measured the mean decrease accuracy for every metabolite to assess variable importance, and the top 5% of these metabolites were included in the refined metabolite profile. This refined profile consisted of the most important metabolites for class separation, ensuring that our model focused on the most relevant features. The feature selection process was conducted using the training data only, adhering to best practices to avoid data leakage and ensure the robustness of our findings.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The study employed machine learning techniques, specifically random forests (RF), to analyze the metabolome data of World Trade Center-exposed firefighters. The number of metabolites (features) was indeed much larger than the number of subjects (training points). To address the potential issue of overfitting, several strategies were implemented.\n\nFirstly, the RF method itself is designed to mitigate overfitting. It uses a large ensemble of decision trees, each trained on a bootstrap sample of the data, and aggregates their results. This bootstrap-aggregating procedure, or bagging, helps to reduce the variance and improve the stability of the model.\n\nAdditionally, the study ran ten replicates of each RF model to ensure the stability and robustness of the results. The best model was selected based on the lowest estimated out-of-bag error rate, which is a permutation-based assessment of internal model validity. This approach helps to ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data.\n\nTo further refine the model and reduce the risk of overfitting, a two-step process was used. Initially, the RF was run on the qualified metabolite profile, which included all metabolites detected in 80% or more of subjects per group with a relative standard deviation of 15% or greater. Then, a refined metabolite profile was developed by including only the top 5% of metabolites that were most important to class separation, as measured by mean decrease accuracy. The RF was rerun with this refined profile to evaluate the classification accuracy.\n\nThe use of a high number of decision trees (10^6 for the qualified profile and 10^3 for the refined profile) also helps to decrease the potential for false discoveries and overfitting. The number of metabolites sampled with replacement at each node was set to the square root of the number of metabolites in the profile, which is a common practice in RF to balance bias and variance.\n\nRegarding underfitting, the study used a non-parametric method (RF) that does not make strong assumptions about the data distribution. This approach allows the model to capture complex relationships in the data. Moreover, the use of a large number of trees in the RF ensemble ensures that the model has the capacity to learn from the data and generalize well to new, unseen data. The model's performance was also evaluated using out-of-bag classification procedures, which provide an internal estimate of the model's generalization error.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our machine learning models. One of the primary methods used was the bootstrap-aggregating procedure, commonly known as bagging, which is integral to the random forest (RF) algorithm. This procedure helps to mitigate overfitting by creating multiple decision trees using different subsets of the data, thereby reducing the variance and improving the model's generalization ability.\n\nAdditionally, the random forest algorithm itself is designed to handle high variable-to-observation ratios effectively. By growing a large number of decision trees, the potential for false discoveries is decreased, as the model relies on the consensus of many trees rather than a single tree's output. This ensemble approach enhances the stability and reliability of the model.\n\nTo further validate our model, we utilized out-of-bag (OOB) classification procedures. OOB error estimation is a form of internal validation that assesses the model's performance on data not used in the training process, providing a more accurate measure of its generalization capability. This method helps to ensure that our findings are not merely artifacts of the training data but reflect genuine patterns in the data.\n\nMoreover, we implemented a refined metabolite profile by selecting the top 5% of metabolites that were most important to class separation, as measured by mean decrease accuracy. This step helps to focus on the most relevant features, reducing the complexity of the model and further preventing overfitting. The refined profile was then used to evaluate the classification accuracy, ensuring that the model's performance is based on the most significant metabolites.\n\nIn summary, our approach to preventing overfitting involved the use of bagging in the random forest algorithm, OOB classification procedures, and the selection of a refined metabolite profile. These techniques collectively enhance the model's robustness and reliability, ensuring that our findings are valid and generalizable.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters used in our study are detailed within the publication. Specifically, the random forest (RF) models employed 10^6 and 10^3 trees for the qualified and refined profiles, respectively. The number of metabolites sampled with replacement at each node was the square root of the number of metabolites in the profile. Ten replicates of each RF model were run to ensure stability, and the best model was identified by the lowest estimated out-of-bag error rate of classification.\n\nThe optimization schedule involved using the randomForest package in R (V.3.4.3) to develop a refined metabolite profile by including the top 5% of metabolites important to class separation, as measured by mean decrease accuracy. This process helped in reducing the dimensionality of the data while preserving the variance and identifying key metabolites that contribute to class differentiation.\n\nRegarding the availability of model files and optimization parameters, the specific details and scripts used for the analysis are not explicitly provided in the main text. However, the methods and tools used, such as the randomForest package in R and SPSS V.23 for data handling and statistical analysis, are well-documented and publicly available. The use of these tools ensures reproducibility and transparency in our analytical approach.\n\nFor those interested in replicating or building upon our work, the methods section provides a comprehensive overview of the data processing, quality control, and machine learning techniques employed. While the exact model files may not be available, the described procedures and software tools can be accessed and utilized by researchers in the field.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a blackbox. It utilizes random forests (RF), a machine learning method known for its interpretability. RF is an ensemble learning technique that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes of the individual trees. This approach allows for the measurement of each metabolite's importance to the model's classification accuracy, a metric known as mean decrease accuracy.\n\nThis metric is particularly useful as it enables researchers to focus on the metabolites that are most crucial for differentiating between classes. By identifying these key metabolites, the model provides insights into the biological processes and pathways that may be associated with the condition under study. For instance, the model highlighted clusters of metabolites, including sphingolipids and branched-chain amino acids, which are known mediators of lung disease.\n\nMoreover, the use of principal component analysis (PCA) further enhances the interpretability of the model. PCA is a statistical technique used to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining as much variability as possible. By projecting the data onto the eigenbasis of the correlation matrix, PCA helps to identify potential relationships between correlated metabolites. This visualization tool allows researchers to understand how different metabolites interact and contribute to the overall classification.\n\nAdditionally, the model's stability and validity were assured through the implementation of ten replicates of each RF model. The best model was identified by the lowest estimated out-of-bag error rate of classification, a permutation-based assessment of internal model validity. This rigorous approach ensures that the model's findings are robust and reliable.\n\nIn summary, the model's use of RF and PCA, along with the measurement of mean decrease accuracy, provides a transparent and interpretable framework. This allows for a deeper understanding of the metabolic pathways and biomarkers associated with the condition, making the model a valuable tool for biological and medical research.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in our study is a classification model. We utilized random forests (RF), a machine learning technique, to classify subjects based on their metabolomic profiles.

The best RF model was selected based on the lowest estimated out-of-bag error rate, ensuring the stability and validity of the model. The final model correctly classified subjects with a 93.3% estimated success rate, demonstrating its effectiveness in distinguishing between the two groups.",

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the method involved several key steps to ensure the robustness and validity of the findings. Initially, the qualified metabolites were subjected to a random forest (RF) analysis using the randomForest package in R.

The RF models consisted of a large number of decision trees, specifically 10^6 trees for the qualified profile and 10^3 trees for the refined profile, with the number of metabolites sampled at each node being the square root of the number of metabolites in the profile.\n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) was implemented to visualize the separation between cases and controls in the qualified metabolites compared to the machine learning-generated refined profile. PCA is a tool used in exploratory data analysis that allows for dimension reduction while preserving the variance of the data. Each attribute was mean-centered, normalized, and projected onto the eigenbasis of the correlation matrix of all attributes. The number of components retained was determined based on an analysis of the scree plot, and the variance explained by PCA was quantified as the summation of the percentage of total variance explained by the identified components.\n\nAdditionally, unsupervised two-way hierarchical clustering was performed on the refined profile\u2019s correlation matrix using Pearson correlation as a distance metric and average linkage. This clustering helped identify potential relationships between correlated metabolites. The evaluation process did not include an independent validation cohort, which means the findings have not been externally validated. However, the use of out-of-bag classification procedures and support from pertinent literature helped assess model validity. The strength of the analysis lies in its ability to identify intrinsic data patterns, although these patterns do not establish causal relationships.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our machine learning model, we primarily focused on the performance of the Random Forest (RF) classifier. The key performance metric reported is the out-of-bag (OOB) estimated error rate, which is a permutation-based assessment of internal model validity. For our refined metabolite profile, the RF model achieved an estimated accuracy of 93.3%, corresponding to a 6.7% OOB error rate. This metric is crucial as it indicates the model's ability to generalize to unseen data by evaluating the classification accuracy when each tree in the forest is tested on data not used in its construction.\n\nAdditionally, we employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to visualize the separation between cases and controls. The PCA of the refined metabolite profile captured 68.3% of the variance in the data using five components, demonstrating improved class separation compared to the initial PCA of the qualified metabolite profile. This suggests that the refined profile, which includes the top 5% of metabolites important to class separation, effectively reduces dimensionality while preserving the variance necessary for distinguishing between cases and controls.\n\nThe use of these performance metrics is representative of standard practices in the field. The OOB error rate is a robust measure of model performance, particularly in the context of high-dimensional data like metabolomics. PCA is widely used for dimension reduction and exploratory data analysis, providing insights into the structure of the data and the relationships between metabolites. Together, these metrics offer a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance and the effectiveness of the feature selection process.",

  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our machine learning models, particularly the Random Forest (RF) models, was conducted with a focus on ensuring stability and validity.

The best model was identified by the lowest estimated out-of-bag (OOB) error rate, which is a permutation-based assessment of internal model validity. This approach helps to mitigate overfitting, especially given the high variable-to-observation ratio in our dataset. The OOB error rate provides a measure of the model's performance on unseen data, offering a form of internal validation.\n\nFor statistical significance, we used non-parametric tests such as the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous data and Pearson \u03c7\u00b2 test for categorical data. These tests helped us to compare differences between groups and determine if the observed differences were statistically significant.\n\nIn addition to the RF models, we performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to visualize the separation between cases and controls. PCA allowed us to reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving variance, and we quantified the variance explained by the retained components.

This clustering method used Pearson correlation as a distance metric and average linkage, providing another layer of validation for the patterns observed in the data.\n\nWhile we did not explicitly mention confidence intervals for the performance metrics, the use of OOB error rates and statistical tests provides a robust framework for evaluating the significance and reliability of our findings. However, it is important to note that external validation with an independent cohort would strengthen the generalizability of our results. This type of validation is acknowledged as a crucial next step in confirming the replicability and broader applicability of our methods and findings.",
