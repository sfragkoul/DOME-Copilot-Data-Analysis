  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in our study is the DDI corpus, which was a major contribution of the DDIExtraction challenge. This corpus serves as a benchmark for training and evaluating supervised machine-learning algorithms designed to extract drug-drug interactions (DDIs) from texts. It comprises 233 abstracts from MedLine, referred to as DDI-MedLine, and 792 texts from the DrugBank database, known as DDI-DrugBank. The corpus is manually annotated, containing a total of 18,502 pharmacological substances and 5,028 DDIs. The annotation process was meticulously designed to ensure quality and consistency, with high inter-annotator agreement, particularly for the DDI-DrugBank dataset (Kappa = 0.83) and moderate agreement for DDI-MedLine (0.55\u20130.72). The complexity of MedLine abstracts, which often feature intricate sentences, contrasts with the simpler sentences typically found in DrugBank texts. The corpus is distributed in XML documents, adhering to the unified format proposed by Pyysalo et al. for protein-protein interaction (PPI) corpora. This structured format facilitates the integration and analysis of the data, making it a valuable resource for the community.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset used in our study is the DDI corpus, which is a benchmark corpus for training and evaluating supervised machine-learning algorithms to extract Drug-Drug Interactions (DDIs) from texts. The corpus is split into two main datasets: DDI-DrugBank and DDI-MedLine.\n\nThe DDI-DrugBank dataset consists of 792 texts from the DrugBank database, containing a total of 13,794 pharmacological substances and 4,701 DDIs. The DDI-MedLine dataset includes 233 selected abstracts about DDIs from MedLine, with 4,708 pharmacological substances and 327 DDIs.\n\nFor our experiments, we further split the training dataset at the sentence level. We randomly selected 2,748 instances (candidate pairs), which corresponds to 10% of the training dataset, to form our validation set. This validation set was used to fine-tune the hyper-parameters of our architecture. The remaining 90% of the training dataset was used for training the models. The test dataset was kept separate and was not used during the training or validation phases.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The DDI corpus, which serves as the benchmark for our study, comprises two main datasets: DDI-MedLine and DDI-DrugBank. The DDI-MedLine dataset includes 233 abstracts from MedLine, while the DDI-DrugBank dataset consists of 792 texts from the DrugBank database. These datasets were manually annotated, resulting in a total of 18,502 pharmacological substances and 5,028 drug-drug interactions (DDIs).\n\nThe corpus was divided into training and test sets to evaluate the performance of our models. The training set contains 27,663 instances, while the test set includes 5,688 instances. This split ensures that the training and test sets are independent, allowing for an unbiased evaluation of our models' performance.\n\nTo enforce the independence of the training and test sets, we followed a rigorous pre-processing phase. This phase involved defining the maximum length of the dataset, setting the number of filters for each window size, determining the dropout rate, and specifying the l2-regularization and mini-batch size. These parameters were carefully chosen to optimize the performance of our convolutional neural network (CNN) models.\n\nThe distribution of the DDI corpus compares favorably to previously published machine learning datasets in the field of drug-drug interaction extraction. The corpus provides a comprehensive and diverse set of annotated texts, which is essential for training and evaluating supervised machine-learning algorithms. The high inter-annotator agreement (IAA) for the DDI-DrugBank dataset (Kappa = 0.83) and the moderate IAA for the DDI-MedLine dataset (0.55\u20130.72) further attest to the quality and consistency of the annotation process. This ensures that the corpus is a reliable resource for developing and testing DDI extraction systems.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our work is the Adam optimizer, which is a method for stochastic optimization. It is not a new algorithm; it was introduced by Kingma and Ba in 2014. The choice to use Adam was driven by its efficiency and effectiveness in handling sparse gradients on noisy problems, which is common in natural language processing tasks. While Adam is widely recognized and used in the machine learning community, it was not published in a traditional machine-learning journal but rather as a technical report in the Computing Research Repository (CoRR). This is a common practice for quickly disseminating research findings and receiving feedback from the community before formal publication. The Adam optimizer has since been extensively validated and adopted in various machine learning applications, demonstrating its robustness and versatility.",
  "optimization/meta": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, data encoding and preprocessing were crucial steps to prepare the sentences for the convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Initially, each sentence was tokenized and cleaned, converting all words to lowercase and separating special characters with white spaces using regular expressions. This standardization ensured consistency in the input data.\n\nEach pair of drugs in a sentence was considered a potential relation instance. To handle drug mentions, we employed a technique called entity blinding. This involved replacing the two interacting drug mentions with the labels 'drug1' and 'drug2', and any other drug mentions with 'drug0'. This method helped the model generalize better by focusing on the relationships between the labeled entities rather than the specific drug names.\n\nDiscontinuous drug mentions, which were rare and challenging to handle, were removed from the dataset. This decision was made because they constituted only a small percentage of the total instances and would have complicated the model without significantly improving its performance.\n\nAfter preprocessing, we created an input matrix suitable for the CNN architecture. The sentences were padded with an auxiliary token '0' to ensure that all instances had the same length, which was determined by the maximum sentence length in the dataset.\n\nFor word representation, we considered two options: randomly initializing vectors for each word or using pre-trained word embedding models. The pre-trained models replaced each word with its corresponding vector from the embedding matrix. Additionally, we calculated the relative positions of each word to the two interacting drugs and mapped these distances into real value vectors using position embeddings. The final input matrix for the CNN was a concatenation of the word embeddings and the position embeddings for each word in the instance.\n\nThis encoding and preprocessing pipeline ensured that the input data was consistent and well-structured, enabling the CNN model to effectively learn the relationships between drug mentions in the sentences.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our model, we utilized a dropout rate of 50%, which is one of the key parameters. This parameter was selected based on established practices and was kept consistent across all experiments. The dropout rate is crucial for preventing overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of the input units to zero during training. This helps in making the model more robust and generalizable to unseen data. The value of 50% was chosen as it is a commonly used rate in many neural network architectures, providing a good balance between regularization and retaining useful information.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for drug-drug interaction (DDI) classification. The input features for our CNN model were randomly initialized vectors of 300 dimensions. These vectors were generated using a uniform distribution in the range [-1, 1]. This approach was chosen instead of using pre-trained word embeddings to allow the model to learn features directly from the data.\n\nFeature selection was not performed in the traditional sense, as we did not manually select or engineer specific features. Instead, our CNN model automatically learns relevant features from the input data during the training process. This approach aligns with our goal of creating a model that can learn features without relying on external information or extensive feature engineering.\n\nThe validation set, which consisted of 2748 instances randomly selected from the training dataset, was used to fine-tune the hyper-parameters of the architecture. This ensured that the model's performance was optimized without directly using the test set, maintaining the integrity of the evaluation process. The use of a validation set helped in preventing overfitting and ensured that the model generalized well to unseen data.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our experiments, we defined several key parameters to ensure effective training and to mitigate both overfitting and underfitting. The maximal length of the dataset after preprocessing was set to 128, with 200 filters for each window size. A dropout rate of 50% was applied, along with l2-regularization set to 3. The mini-batch size was 50, and the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) was used as the non-linear function.\n\nTo address the potential issue of overfitting, given the relatively large number of parameters compared to the number of training points, we employed several strategies. Firstly, we used dropout, which randomly sets elements of the feature vector to zero during training, helping to prevent the model from becoming too reliant on specific features. Secondly, l2-regularization was applied to the weights of the softmax layer, which penalizes large weights and encourages a more generalized model. Additionally, we monitored the learning curve, which showed that the validation F1 score reached its peak at 27 epochs without a significant gap between training and validation performance, indicating that overfitting was not a major concern.\n\nTo ensure that the model was not underfitting, we carefully selected the number of epochs. The learning curve indicated that the model's performance started to decrease after 25 epochs, which was identified as the optimal point for training. This decision was also supported by previous work, where 25 epochs were chosen as the training duration. Furthermore, the use of a validation set allowed us to fine-tune the hyperparameters and ensure that the model generalized well to unseen data. The similar performance of the validation and test sets confirmed that the chosen parameters were effective and that the model was neither overfitting nor underfitting.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our model. One of the key methods used was dropout, which was applied with a rate of 50%. Dropout works by randomly setting elements of the feature vector to zero during training, which helps to prevent the model from becoming too reliant on any single feature and thus reduces overfitting.\n\nAdditionally, we incorporated l2-regularization with a value of 3. L2-regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients. This encourages the model to keep the coefficients small, which can help to prevent overfitting by discouraging the model from fitting the noise in the training data.\n\nFurthermore, we used stochastic gradient descent with the Adam update rule for optimization. This method adapts the learning rate for each parameter, which can help to improve convergence and reduce overfitting.\n\nThe learning curve also indicated that our model did not exhibit significant overfitting. The training and validation F1 scores were closely aligned, suggesting that the model generalized well to the validation set without memorizing the training data. This was further confirmed by the similar performance on the test set, indicating that the chosen parameters were effective and the model was not overfitting.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization schedule used in our experiments are detailed within the publication. Specific parameters such as the maximal length, filters for each window size, dropout rate, l2-regularization, mini-batch size, and the non-linear function used are explicitly mentioned. These configurations were chosen based on a thorough evaluation process involving a validation set derived from the training dataset.\n\nThe model files and optimization parameters are not explicitly mentioned as being available for download or access. However, the methods and results are described in sufficient detail to allow for replication of the experiments by other researchers. The publication does not provide specific information on the licensing of the data or models, but it adheres to standard academic practices, implying that the methods and findings can be used for further research and development.\n\nThe learning curve and performance metrics, such as Precision, Recall, and F1-score, are presented to validate the effectiveness of the chosen parameters. The statistical significance of the results is also discussed, ensuring that the reported performance is reliable. The experiments were conducted using a CNN architecture, and the effects of different filter sizes and word embeddings were analyzed to optimize the model's performance.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model presented in this work is a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for drug-drug interaction (DDI) extraction. While CNNs are often considered black-box models due to their complex architectures and the difficulty in interpreting their internal workings, our approach provides some level of transparency through the use of word embeddings and the absence of external features.\n\nThe CNN model computes an output vector that describes the entire sentence and applies convolving filters to the input through several windows of different sizes. This process allows the model to capture local dependencies and patterns in the text, which are crucial for identifying DDIs. The use of word embeddings as input features enables the model to learn semantic representations of words, making it more interpretable compared to models that rely on extensive feature engineering.\n\nOne example of the model's transparency is its ability to learn the priority rule defined by annotators for classifying DDI types. The rule prioritizes mechanism, followed by effect, and then advice. The CNN model appears to have acquired this rule correctly, demonstrating its capacity to understand and apply domain-specific knowledge.\n\nAdditionally, the model's performance varies depending on the type of DDI and the dataset. For instance, it achieves the best F1 score for the 'advice' type, followed by 'mechanism' and 'effect'. The 'int' type is the most challenging to classify, likely due to its scarcity in the corpus. This variability in performance across different types and datasets provides insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses, further enhancing its interpretability.\n\nIn summary, while the CNN model is not entirely transparent, it offers a degree of interpretability through its use of word embeddings, the absence of external features, and its ability to learn domain-specific rules. These aspects make it a more interpretable alternative to traditional feature-engineering approaches for DDI extraction.",
  "model/output": "The model is a classification model. It is designed to classify drug-drug interactions (DDIs) into specific categories. The categories include advice, effect, int, mechanism, and non-DDI. The model uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to process input sentences and output a classification label for each instance. The final layer of the model is a softmax layer, which computes the output prediction values for the classification. This indicates that the model is used for a multi-class classification task, where the goal is to assign one of the predefined classes to each input instance. The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1-score for each of the categories.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "The source code for the model is not directly released by the authors. However, the implementation used is based on an adaptation of the work provided by Denny Britz, which is available on GitHub. This adaptation is based on TensorFlow, an open-source library for machine learning. TensorFlow offers a graphic visualization of the model and generates summaries of the parameters, which simplifies the study of the parameters. Unfortunately, the specific adapted code is not publicly available for direct use.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method involved a comprehensive process to select the best model and fine-tune its hyper-parameters. Since the Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) corpus was only split into training and test datasets, a validation set was created by randomly selecting 2748 instances (10%) from the training dataset at the sentence level. This validation set was used consistently across all experiments to optimize the model's hyper-parameters.\n\nThe evaluation process included several key steps. First, a learning curve was generated to determine the optimal number of epochs for the best performance, using a stopping criterion to prevent overfitting. Second, a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was computed with predefined parameters to establish a baseline system. The results of this baseline were then analyzed.\n\nSubsequent steps involved observing the effects of different filter sizes and the selection of various word embeddings and position embeddings. Finally, a CNN model was created using the best parameters identified from the previous steps.\n\nTo validate each setting, a statistical significance analysis was performed between the models using the chi-square (v2) and P-value statistics. Two models were considered to produce different levels of performance if the v2 value was greater than 3.84 and the P-value was lower than 0.05. This rigorous evaluation process ensured that the chosen model and its parameters were optimal for the task of DDI classification.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our evaluation, we focused on several key performance metrics to assess the effectiveness of our models. Specifically, we reported Precision (P), Recall (R), and F1-score (F1) for all categories in the classification. These metrics are widely used in the literature and provide a comprehensive view of the model's performance.\n\nPrecision measures the accuracy of the positive predictions made by the model, indicating how many of the predicted positive instances are actually correct. Recall, on the other hand, assesses the model's ability to identify all relevant instances within the dataset, showing how many of the actual positive instances were correctly predicted. The F1-score is the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall, providing a single metric that balances both concerns. This is particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets, as it gives a more nuanced view of the model's performance.\n\nThese metrics are representative of the standards in the field, ensuring that our results can be compared meaningfully with other studies. By focusing on Precision, Recall, and F1-score, we aim to provide a clear and thorough evaluation of our models' capabilities in identifying and classifying the relevant categories.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In the \"Methods Comparison\" subsection, we conducted a thorough evaluation of our approach by comparing it to both publicly available methods and simpler baselines. To ensure a fair and comprehensive assessment, we utilized benchmark datasets, which are widely recognized in the field.\n\nFirst, we established a baseline system using a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with predefined parameters. This step was crucial as it provided a reference point to measure the improvements made by our more complex models. The baseline system's performance was analyzed to understand the fundamental capabilities of a simple CNN architecture in our specific context.\n\nNext, we explored the effects of different parameters, such as filter size and the selection of word embeddings and position embeddings. This involved experimenting with various configurations to identify the optimal settings that enhanced the model's performance. The results of these experiments were statistically significant, as indicated by the v2 and P-value statistics, ensuring that the observed improvements were not due to random chance.\n\nWe also compared our approach to publicly available methods, using the same benchmark datasets. This comparison allowed us to contextualize our results within the broader research community and demonstrate the competitiveness of our model. The statistical significance of our results was verified using the v2 and P-value statistics, with a threshold of v2 > 3.84 and P-value < 0.05 indicating significant differences in performance.\n\nThroughout this process, we followed a rigorous evaluation procedure. We used Precision (P), Recall (R), and F1-score (F1) as our primary metrics to assess the performance across all categories in the classification task. Additionally, we performed a statistical significance analysis between the models to validate the robustness of our findings.\n\nIn summary, our evaluation involved a detailed comparison with both simpler baselines and publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. This comprehensive approach allowed us to demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of our model in the field.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "In our evaluation, we employed statistical significance analysis to validate the performance of different models. This analysis was crucial in determining whether the observed differences in performance were due to actual improvements in the models or merely due to random variation.\n\nWe used the chi-square (v2) and P-value statistics for this purpose. Specifically, two models were considered to have significantly different performance levels if the chi-square value was greater than 3.84 and the P-value was lower than 0.05. This threshold ensured that the results were statistically significant, providing confidence in the superiority of one model over another.\n\nThe asterisks in the presented results denote statistically significant outcomes. This means that the performance metrics reported for these models are not only numerically better but also statistically significant, indicating a genuine improvement over the baselines and other compared methods.\n\nThe use of these statistical measures allowed us to assert with confidence that the methods and models we proposed are indeed superior to the baselines and other existing approaches. This rigorous evaluation process ensures that our claims of improved performance are robust and reliable.",
