  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study originates from the work of Jiang et al. The original datasets consist of RNA m5U modification sites. Positive samples were processed to obtain a 41 nucleotide modified sequence, with the modified U site experimentally determined to be in the middle of the sequence. Negative samples were randomly selected from unmodified uridine sites within the same transcripts as the positive samples.\n\nThe full transcript mode dataset comprises 3696 positive samples and 3696 negative samples. The mature mRNA mode dataset consists of 1232 positive samples and 1232 negative samples. To ensure the robustness of the model, homologous sequences were removed using CD-HIT with a threshold of 80%. This resulted in the following datasets:\n\n* Full transcript mode training set: 1534 positive samples and 2862 negative samples\n* Full transcript mode independent test set: 500 positive samples and 731 negative samples\n* Mature mRNA mode training set: 983 positive samples and 985 negative samples\n* Mature mRNA mode independent test set: 245 positive samples and 247 negative samples\n\nThe datasets used in this study are publicly available and can be accessed at the provided GitHub repository. This ensures that the community can verify and build upon the findings presented in this work.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset used in this study consists of two main modes: full transcript and mature mRNA. For each mode, the data was split into training and independent test sets.\n\nFor the full transcript mode, the dataset initially consisted of 3696 positive samples and 3696 negative samples. After removing homologous sequences using CD-HIT with a threshold of 80%, the dataset was split into a training set containing 1534 positive samples and 2862 negative samples, and an independent test set containing 500 positive samples and 731 negative samples.\n\nFor the mature mRNA mode, the dataset consisted of 1232 positive samples and 1232 negative samples. This dataset was split into a training set containing 983 positive samples and 985 negative samples, and an independent test set containing 245 positive samples and 247 negative samples.\n\nThe relevant datasets can be accessed at the provided GitHub repository.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets used in this study were derived from RNA m5U modification sites, specifically from the work of Jiang et al. The positive samples were processed to obtain a 41 nucleotide (nt) modified sequence, with the modified U site experimentally determined to be in the middle of the sequence. Negative samples were obtained by randomly selecting unmodified uridine sites from the same transcripts as the positive samples.\n\nThe full transcript mode dataset consisted of 3696 positive samples and 3696 negative samples. The mature mRNA mode dataset consisted of 1232 positive samples and 1232 negative samples. Homologous sequences were not initially removed from the acquired sequences.\n\nTo address potential issues with sequence homology, which could affect model performance, CD-HIT was used to remove sequences with high homology. A threshold of 80% was applied to the full transcript mode m5U modification site data. This process resulted in the following datasets:\n\n* Full transcript mode training set: 1534 positive samples and 2862 negative samples\n* Full transcript mode independent test set: 500 positive samples and 731 negative samples\n* Mature mRNA mode training set: 983 positive samples and 985 negative samples\n* Mature mRNA mode independent test set: 245 positive samples and 247 negative samples\n\nThe training and test sets are independent, as the test sets were not used during the training process. The use of CD-HIT ensured that the datasets had a controlled level of redundancy, which is important for the robustness and generalizability of the machine learning models.\n\nThe distribution of the datasets compares favorably to previously published machine learning datasets in the field of RNA modification site prediction. The use of a large and diverse set of samples, along with the removal of high homology sequences, helps to ensure that the models developed are robust and generalizable to new, unseen data. The datasets are publicly available for download, promoting transparency and reproducibility in research.",
  "dataset/availability": "The datasets used in this study are publicly available. The training and testing datasets can be downloaded from a specific repository on GitHub. The webserver implementing the m5U-SVM predictor is freely accessible, allowing users to access the datasets and the source code. All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the published article, its supplementary information files, and publicly available repositories.

The source code for the m5U-SVM predictor is also available on GitHub, ensuring transparency and reproducibility. The datasets and code are released under standard open-source licenses, promoting open access and collaboration.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our study primarily utilizes traditional machine learning methods, including random forests (RF), support vector machines (SVM), logistic regression (LR), light gradient boosting machines (LightGBM), decision trees (DT), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and naive Bayes (NB). These are well-established algorithms in the field of machine learning and have been extensively used in various bioinformatics applications.\n\nIn addition to these traditional methods, we also incorporated deep learning architectures. Specifically, we used two hybrid models: DL1, which combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM), and DL2, which integrates CNN with gate recurrent units (GRU). These deep learning models are commonly used in biological sequence analysis and prediction tasks.\n\nThe SVM algorithm was particularly highlighted in our study due to its superior performance. We optimized the SVM model using grid search and tenfold cross-validation to determine the best hyperparameters, including the kernel width parameter, the kernel parameter, and the regularization parameter. The implementation of SVM was carried out using the Python package scikit-learn.\n\nThe choice of these algorithms was driven by their proven effectiveness in handling complex data and their ability to capture intricate patterns in biological sequences. The SVM, in particular, demonstrated exceptional performance in predicting m5U modification sites, outperforming other algorithms in terms of accuracy, specificity, Matthews correlation coefficient, and area under the curve. This led us to select SVM as the final predictive model for our study.\n\nThe algorithms used are not new; they are well-documented and widely used in the machine learning community. The focus of our publication is on their application in bioinformatics, specifically in the prediction of RNA modification sites. Therefore, it is appropriate to publish these findings in a biology-focused journal rather than a machine learning journal, as the primary contribution lies in the biological insights and the practical application of these algorithms to a specific biological problem.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model described in this publication is not a meta-predictor. It does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it employs a variety of machine learning methods to construct prediction models for RNA m5U modification sites. These methods include traditional machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Light Gradient Boosting Machines (LightGBM), Decision Trees (DT), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Naive Bayes (NB). Additionally, two deep learning architectures, referred to as DL1 and DL2, are used for comparison.\n\nThe model construction process involves several steps, including dataset collection and preprocessing, multi-view feature representation, and model training and performance evaluation. The features used in the model are optimized through a two-step feature selection process involving methods like ANOVA, F-score, LightGBM, and XGBoost, followed by an accuracy-based incremental feature selection (IFS) strategy.\n\nThe training data for the models is derived from datasets of RNA m5U modification sites, which are preprocessed to remove homologous sequences and ensure the independence of the training and testing sets. The performance of the models is evaluated using tenfold cross-validation and independent testing, ensuring that the training data is independent and the results are robust.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, we employed multi-view feature representation methods to transform nucleotide sequences into feature vectors. This process involved two main classes of feature representation methods: physicochemical feature representation methods and distributed representation methods.\n\nFor physicochemical feature representation, we utilized four encoding strategies to formulate RNA modification fragments. These strategies included enhanced nucleic acid composition (ENAC), the composition of k-spaced nucleic acid pairs (CKSNAP), Kmer, and pseudo dinucleotide composition (PseDNC). Each of these methods was implemented using the iLearn and iLearnplus toolkits.\n\nENAC, for instance, is a variation of 1-mer nucleic acid frequency. It calculates the frequency of occurrence of each nucleotide in a sequence within a fixed-length window that slides from the 5' to the 3' terminus of each RNA sequence. This process generates a 4k-dimensional feature vector.\n\nIn addition to physicochemical features, we also used a distributed representation method called word2vec. This method divides all trained modified nucleotide sequences into a Kmer corpus and then uses the skip-gram model to obtain 100-dimensional feature vectors for each Kmer. The hyperparameters optimized in this process included the length k of the nucleotide sequence Kmer and the window size w, which ranged from 2 to 10 and 1 to 7, respectively.\n\nThe features obtained from both physicochemical and distributed representation methods were then fused to create multi-view features. These multi-view features were found to outperform single-view features and optimized traditional physicochemical features in predicting RNA m5U modification sites.\n\nOverall, the data encoding process involved transforming raw nucleotide sequences into meaningful feature vectors using a combination of physicochemical and distributed representation methods, which were then optimized and fused to enhance prediction accuracy.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the number of features (p) used in the model was initially high due to the combination of four different physicochemical property features. This resulted in high-dimensional features, which can lead to information redundancy and increased computational complexity. To address this, a two-step feature optimization approach was employed.\n\nFirst, feature importance ranking methods such as ANOVA, F-score, LightGBM, and XGBoost were used to rank the features. This step helped in identifying the most relevant features. Following this, an accuracy-based incremental feature selection (IFS) strategy was applied to determine the optimal feature subset.\n\nFor the full transcript mode, a subset of 216 optimal features was selected from the initial 497-dimensional features. Similarly, for the mature mRNA mode, a subset of 182 optimal features was chosen. The selection of these features was based on their importance values, ensuring that the most relevant features were retained for model construction.\n\nThe optimized features were then analyzed to understand their contribution to the model. For instance, in the full transcript mode, the ENAC feature had the largest share among the four physicochemical features, accounting for 43.06% of the optimized feature subset. This indicates that ENAC features were particularly important for this mode.\n\nIn summary, the number of parameters (p) was reduced through a systematic feature selection process, ensuring that the model used the most relevant features for accurate predictions.",
  "optimization/features": "The input features used in this study are derived from four physicochemical property descriptors: CKSNAP, ENAC, Kmer, and PseDNC. Initially, these descriptors result in a high-dimensional feature set, specifically 497 dimensions. To address issues like high dimensionality and information redundancy, a two-step feature optimization approach was employed. This approach involved first ranking feature importance using methods such as ANOVA, F-score, LightGBM, and XGBoost. Subsequently, an accuracy-based incremental feature selection (IFS) strategy was used to determine the optimal feature subset.\n\nThe feature selection process was conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the independent test set remained unseen during this phase. This approach helps in mitigating overfitting and provides a more robust evaluation of the model's performance. For the full transcript mode, a subset of 216 optimal features was selected, while for the mature mRNA mode, 182 optimal features were chosen. The selected features were then used to construct the prediction models, which demonstrated improved performance metrics compared to using the full feature set.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed Support Vector Machines (SVM) for model construction, which is known for its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional spaces and is particularly useful when the number of features exceeds the number of samples. This is a common scenario in bioinformatics, where the feature space can be vast compared to the available data points.\n\nTo address the potential issue of overfitting, we utilized a combination of grid search and tenfold cross-validation (CV). Grid search systematically works through multiple combinations of parameter tunes to determine the optimal hyperparameters for the SVM model. Tenfold CV involves dividing the dataset into ten parts, using nine parts for training and one part for validation, and repeating this process ten times. This method ensures that each data point is used for both training and validation, providing a robust estimate of the model's performance and helping to prevent overfitting.\n\nAdditionally, we implemented regularization within the SVM framework. The regularization parameter C controls the trade-off between achieving a low training error and a low testing error, helping to mitigate overfitting by penalizing large weights.\n\nUnderfitting was addressed by carefully selecting and optimizing the kernel parameters. We experimented with various kernel functions, including Gaussian radial basis functions (RBF), sigmoid kernels, linear kernels, and polynomial kernels, to capture the underlying patterns in the data effectively. The choice of kernel and its parameters was guided by the grid search and tenfold CV process, ensuring that the model was complex enough to capture the necessary patterns without becoming too simplistic.\n\nFurthermore, feature optimization played a crucial role in preventing underfitting. We employed a two-step feature optimization approach, first ranking features using methods like ANOVA, F-score, LightGBM, and XGBoost, and then using an accuracy-based incremental feature selection (IFS) strategy to determine the optimal feature subset. This process ensured that the most relevant features were included in the model, enhancing its predictive power and reducing the risk of underfitting.\n\nIn summary, by leveraging grid search, tenfold CV, regularization, and feature optimization, we effectively managed to balance the model complexity, avoiding both overfitting and underfitting, and ensuring robust and reliable performance.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our prediction models. One of the key methods used was regularization within the Support Vector Machine (SVM) framework. The SVM model includes a regularization parameter, denoted as C, which controls the trade-off between achieving a low training error and a low testing error. By tuning this parameter, we aimed to minimize overfitting, ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized a two-step feature optimization approach to select the optimal feature subset. This process involved first ranking features based on their importance using methods such as ANOVA, F-score, LightGBM, and XGBoost. Subsequently, we applied an accuracy-based incremental feature selection (IFS) strategy to determine the best subset of features. This approach helped in reducing the dimensionality of the feature space, thereby mitigating the risk of overfitting caused by high-dimensional data.\n\nFurthermore, we employed tenfold cross-validation (CV) to evaluate the performance of our models. This technique involves dividing the dataset into ten parts, using each part as the validation set while the remaining parts serve as the training set. The mean of the results from these ten iterations provides a reliable estimate of the model's accuracy, helping to ensure that the model performs well across different subsets of the data.\n\nIn summary, our approach to preventing overfitting included the use of regularization in the SVM model, a two-step feature optimization process, and tenfold cross-validation. These methods collectively contributed to the development of robust and generalizable prediction models.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters used in our study are reported in the supplementary materials. Specifically, the optimization ranges and results for each feature method are detailed in Additional file 1: Table S1. Additionally, the hyperparameters for the machine learning algorithms, including the Support Vector Machine (SVM), are summarized in Additional file 3: Table S4.\n\nThe optimization schedule involved a two-step feature optimization approach. Initially, feature importance ranking methods such as ANOVA, F-score, LightGBM, and XGBoost were employed to rank the features. Subsequently, an accuracy-based incremental feature selection (IFS) strategy was used to determine the optimal feature subset.\n\nThe model files and specific details about the implementation, such as the use of the Python package scikit-learn for SVM, are also mentioned. However, the exact model files and scripts are not explicitly provided in the main text or supplementary materials. The performance evaluation metrics and comparative results of different machine learning algorithms are presented in tables and figures within the publication.\n\nRegarding the availability and licensing, the supplementary materials are typically accessible to readers of the publication. However, specific details about the licensing of the supplementary materials or model files are not provided in the given context. For access to the supplementary materials, readers would need to refer to the journal's policies or contact the authors directly.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in this study is not a black-box model. To ensure interpretability, we employed the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method, which is a game-theory approach to explain the output of machine learning models. SHAP values provide a way to attribute the contribution of each feature to the prediction, making the model's decisions more transparent.\n\nThe SHAP method quantifies the contribution of each feature in the predictive model by calculating SHAP values. These values indicate the effect of including a particular feature in the model training. For a given feature, the SHAP value is calculated for all possible combinations of features, considering different orders, and then weighted to sum up the contributions.\n\nIn our study, SHAP summary plots were used to identify the top 20 important features for both full transcript and mature mRNA modes. These plots help visualize the distribution of feature importance and show how each feature affects the model's predictions. For instance, the PseDNC_7 feature was found to be highly influential in the full transcript mode, while the PseDNC_18 feature played a significant role in the mature mRNA mode. The SHAP dependency plots further illustrate the effect of individual features on the model's output, providing an intuitive understanding of how features influence predictions.\n\nBy using SHAP, we can determine which features are most important for the model's predictions and understand the impact of high or low feature importance scores. This approach ensures that the model's decisions are not only accurate but also interpretable, which is crucial for applications in biological research.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a classification model. It is designed to predict the presence of m5U modification sites in RNA sequences. The model uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, which is a type of supervised learning algorithm commonly used for classification tasks. The SVM model was trained and evaluated using various performance metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Matthew's correlation coefficient, and F1-score. These metrics are typically used to assess the performance of classification models. The model's output is a binary classification, indicating whether a given sequence contains an m5U modification site or not. The performance of the model was validated using tenfold cross-validation and independent testing, further confirming its classification nature.",

This comprehensive availability of resources supports transparency and reproducibility in scientific research.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the method involved several rigorous steps to ensure its robustness and accuracy. Initially, a tenfold cross-validation (CV) approach was employed. This method divides the dataset into ten parts, using each part sequentially as a validation set while the remaining nine parts serve as the training set. The mean of the results from these ten iterations provides an estimate of the algorithm's accuracy.\n\nIn addition to cross-validation, independent testing was conducted to further validate the model's performance. This involved using a separate dataset that was not part of the training or cross-validation process, ensuring an unbiased assessment of the model's generalization capabilities.\n\nTo comprehensively evaluate the model, five key metrics were utilized: sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), Matthew\u2019s correlation coefficient (MCC), accuracy (Acc), and F1-score (F1). These metrics provide a detailed understanding of the model's performance across different aspects, such as the ability to correctly identify positive and negative cases, as well as the overall balance between precision and recall.\n\nThe implementation of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) was carried out using the Python package scikit-learn. Grid search and tenfold CV were used to determine the optimal hyperparameters of the classifier, including the kernel width parameter, the kernel parameter, and the regularization parameter. This systematic approach ensures that the model is finely tuned for optimal performance.\n\nFurthermore, SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) dependency plots were used to analyze the impact of individual features on the model's predictions. These plots illustrate how a single feature influences the model's output and the interaction effects across different features, providing insights into the most important features for predicting m5U modification sites.\n\nThe evaluation results demonstrated that the developed method outperformed existing tools like m5UPred, showing significant improvements in accuracy and other performance metrics for both full transcript and mature mRNA modes. This comprehensive evaluation underscores the validity and robustness of the proposed method.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed a comprehensive set of performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of our models. These metrics include accuracy (Acc), sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC), and the F1-score (F1). These metrics were chosen because they provide a well-rounded evaluation of model performance, covering aspects such as the overall correctness, the ability to identify positive cases, the ability to identify negative cases, the balance between precision and recall, and the correlation between predicted and actual values.\n\nAccuracy measures the proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined. Sensitivity, also known as recall, assesses the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified by the model. Specificity evaluates the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified. The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both concerns. Matthew's correlation coefficient is a balanced measure that takes into account true and false positives and negatives, providing a value between -1 and 1, where 1 indicates a perfect prediction, 0 indicates a prediction no better than random, and -1 indicates total disagreement between prediction and observation.\n\nThese metrics are widely used in the literature and are considered representative for evaluating classification models, particularly in bioinformatics and machine learning studies. By reporting these metrics, we ensure that our results are comparable with other studies in the field, allowing for a fair assessment of our model's performance. Additionally, we used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to further evaluate the models, providing a single scalar value that summarizes the performance across all classification thresholds. This comprehensive set of metrics allows for a thorough evaluation of our models' strengths and weaknesses.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In the \"Methods Comparison\" subsection, we evaluated the performance of our developed predictor, m5U-SVM, against a publicly available method called m5UPred. This comparison was conducted on benchmark datasets derived from m5UPred, with homologous sequences removed using CD-HIT at a threshold of 0.8. The evaluation metrics used for this comparison included accuracy (Acc), area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC).\n\nFor full transcript mode m5U modification sites, our method demonstrated superior performance under tenfold cross-validation, with Acc, AUC, Sn, Sp, and MCC values of 88.876%, 95.527%, 81.226%, 92.977%, and 0.7527, respectively. This represents an improvement of 5.278% in accuracy over m5UPred. Similarly, for mature mRNA mode m5U modification sites, our method achieved Acc, AUC, Sn, Sp, and MCC values of 94.358%, 98.038%, 92.981%, 95.736%, and 0.8875, respectively, indicating a 4.448% increase in accuracy compared to m5UPred.\n\nUnder independent testing, our predictor also outperformed m5UPred for both full transcript and mature mRNA modes, with accuracy improvements of 3.656% and 4.406%, respectively.

We also included two deep learning architectures (DL1 and DL2) commonly used in biological sequence analysis and prediction. The detailed architectures of these models are introduced in the supplementary materials.\n\nThe performance of these different algorithms was compared using multi-view features, which integrated optimized traditional physicochemical features with distributed representation features. The results, presented in Table 2, show that our method, which utilizes SVM with multi-view features, achieved the highest performance metrics across various evaluation indicators for both full transcript and mature mRNA modes. This comparison demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in improving the prediction accuracy of m5U modification sites.",
