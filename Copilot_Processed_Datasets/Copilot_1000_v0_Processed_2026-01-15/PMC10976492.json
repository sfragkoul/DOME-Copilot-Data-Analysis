  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in this study is a combination of regression techniques, specifically univariate Cox regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, and XGBoost. These methods are well-established in the field of machine learning and statistics.\n\nThe algorithms employed are not new; they are widely used and recognized in the scientific community for their effectiveness in handling survival data and feature selection. Univariate Cox regression is a standard approach for identifying variables associated with survival outcomes. LASSO regression is a popular technique for variable selection and regularization, helping to prevent overfitting by shrinking some coefficients to zero. XGBoost, or Extreme Gradient Boosting, is a powerful ensemble learning method known for its efficiency and performance in predictive modeling.\n\nThe choice of these algorithms is justified by their proven track record in similar studies and their ability to handle the complexities of the data. The focus of this research is on the development and validation of a prognostic model for lung adenocarcinoma, rather than the innovation of new machine-learning algorithms. Therefore, the algorithms were selected for their relevance and effectiveness in achieving the study's objectives.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model developed in this study can be considered a meta-predictor, as it integrates results from multiple machine-learning algorithms to build a robust prognostic signature for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).\n\nThe process began with univariate Cox regression analysis to identify candidate genes associated with survival in the TCGA-LUAD dataset. This step helped in narrowing down the genes that have a significant impact on patient survival.\n\nTwo primary machine-learning methods were then employed to further refine the selection of key genes:\n\n1. **LASSO Regression**: This method was used to perform feature selection and regularization, helping to identify the optimal set of genes that contribute to the prognostic model. LASSO regression is particularly useful for handling high-dimensional data by shrinking the coefficients of less important features to zero.\n\n2. **XGBoost Algorithm**: This gradient boosting framework was utilized to rank the importance of genes. XGBoost is known for its efficiency and performance in handling structured/tabular data, making it suitable for identifying the top features that contribute to the model's predictive power.\n\nThe overlapping genes identified by both LASSO regression and XGBoost were then combined, resulting in a set of four candidate genes. From these, multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to select the final three genes (HLA-DMB, PPIA, and GPI) that constituted the prognostic signature. The multivariate analysis ensured that the selected genes were independent prognostic factors.\n\nThe risk score for each patient was calculated using the formula derived from the coefficients of the selected genes, allowing for the stratification of patients into high-risk and low-risk groups. The model's reliability was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, demonstrating its ability to predict survival outcomes accurately.\n\nTo ensure the independence of the training data, external validation datasets (GSE31210, GSE68465, and ICGC-LUAD cohorts) were used. These datasets were not involved in the initial model training, providing an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance. The consistent results across these validation datasets further support the robustness and generalizability of the prognostic signature.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps. Initially, transcriptome data was utilized to screen out m5C-related immune genes (m5C-IRGs) in the TCGA-LUAD dataset. This involved identifying differentially expressed m5C genes and immune-related genes, followed by correlation analysis to pinpoint DE-m5C-IRGs.\n\nFor the prognostic signature development, univariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify survival-related candidate genes. Subsequently, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and XGBoost algorithms were employed to further refine and select key genes. The LASSO regression helped in identifying the optimal set of genes by minimizing the absolute values of the regression coefficients, while the XGBoost algorithm ranked the importance of features.\n\nThe final prognostic signature was built using multivariate Cox regression analysis, which selected genes with the minimum Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value. The risk score for each sample was calculated using the formula derived from the LASSO coefficients and gene expression levels of the prognostic genes. This risk score was then used to stratify patients into high-risk and low-risk subgroups.\n\nAdditionally, the data underwent various statistical analyses, including Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and correlation analyses to evaluate the prognostic reliability and performance of the model. The expression patterns of the prognostic genes were also validated using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) on clinical samples.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In the optimization process, the number of parameters (p) used in the model was determined through a systematic approach involving multiple regression analyses. Initially, univariate regression analysis identified 27 candidate genes significantly associated with survival in the TCGA-LUAD dataset. To refine this list, LASSO regression analysis was conducted on these 27 genes, ultimately selecting 9 feature genes. Concurrently, the XGBoost algorithm retained the top 10 feature genes. The intersection of these two methods yielded 4 overlapping genes: HLA-DMB, PPIA, VEGFD, and GPI. Further multivariate Cox regression analysis with the minimum AIC value narrowed down the selection to 3 key genes: HLA-DMB, PPIA, and GPI. These 3 genes were used to build the final prognostic signature, serving as the input parameters for the risk model. The risk score formula was derived as follows: risk score = 0.13*HLA-DMB + 0.44*PPIA + 0.34*GPI. This process ensured that the selected parameters were robust and significantly associated with the survival outcomes in lung adenocarcinoma patients.",
  "optimization/features": "The input features for the prognostic model were derived from differentially expressed m5C-related immune genes (DE-m5C-IRGs) associated with survival in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Initially, 76 m5C-IRGs were identified. Univariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify 27 candidate genes significantly associated with survival. To further refine these candidates, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and XGBoost algorithms were applied. LASSO regression selected 9 significant genes, while XGBoost retained the top 10 feature genes. The intersection of these two methods yielded 4 overlapping genes: HLA-DMB, PPIA, VEGFD, and GPI. Subsequently, multivariate Cox regression analysis with the minimum Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value was used to select 3 genes (HLA-DMB, PPIA, and GPI) for building the prognostic signature. Feature selection was performed using the training set only, ensuring that the model's generalizability was not compromised. The final model utilized these 3 genes as input features.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study involved several steps to ensure robustness and generalizability of the prognostic model. Initially, univariate Cox regression analysis was used to identify candidate genes associated with survival, resulting in 27 significant genes. To address the potential issue of overfitting, given the number of parameters (genes) was relatively large compared to the number of training points (samples), we applied the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. This method not only selected the most relevant features but also penalized less important variables, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting.\n\nAdditionally, the XGBoost algorithm was utilized to further refine the selection of key genes. By combining the results from LASSO regression and XGBoost, we identified four overlapping genes. Subsequently, multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to select the final model variables, ensuring that the model had the minimum Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value. This step helped in ruling out underfitting by ensuring that the model was complex enough to capture the underlying patterns in the data.\n\nThe final prognostic signature was built using three genes: HLA-DMB, PPIA, and GPI. The risk score for each sample was calculated using the formula derived from the LASSO coefficients and gene expression levels. This approach ensured that the model was both parsimonious and effective in predicting survival outcomes. The reliability of the model was further validated using external datasets, demonstrating its stability and generalizability.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed regularization methods to prevent overfitting and enhance the robustness of our prognostic model. Specifically, we utilized the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression analysis. This technique is particularly effective in handling high-dimensional data by imposing a penalty on the absolute size of the regression coefficients, which helps in feature selection and reduces the complexity of the model. By applying LASSO, we were able to identify a subset of key genes that are significantly associated with survival outcomes in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients. This approach ensured that our model was not overly complex and that it generalized well to new, unseen data. Additionally, we combined LASSO with the XGBoost algorithm to further refine our selection of feature genes, ensuring that our final prognostic signature was both accurate and reliable.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in this study is not a blackbox. It is designed to be interpretable, providing clear insights into the factors influencing the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients.\n\nThe model incorporates a prognostic signature based on three specific genes: HLA-DMB, PPIA, and GPI. These genes were selected through a rigorous process involving univariate Cox regression, LASSO regression, and multivariate Cox analysis. The final risk model formula is transparent and straightforward: risk score = 0.13*HLA-DMB + 0.44*PPIA + 0.34*GPI. This formula allows for a clear understanding of how each gene contributes to the overall risk score.\n\nThe risk score is used to stratify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups, with significant survival differences observed between these groups. High expression of PPIA and GPI is associated with the low-risk group, while low expression of HLA-DMB is linked to the high-risk group. This transparency enables clinicians to understand the biological significance of the model's predictions.\n\nFurthermore, the model's reliability was validated using external datasets, confirming its robustness and generalizability. The expression patterns of the prognostic genes were also analyzed, showing consistent up-regulation of PPIA and GPI in LUAD samples and decreased expression of HLA-DMB. This information provides a clear biological context for the model's predictions, making it a valuable tool for clinical decision-making.",

It is designed to predict the survival outcomes of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients based on the expression levels of specific genes. The model calculates a risk score for each patient, which is then used to stratify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups. This risk score is derived from a formula that includes the expression levels of three key genes (HLA-DMB, PPIA, and GPI) and their respective coefficients. The model's performance is evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival predictions.

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the method involved several steps to ensure its robustness and validity. Initially, the study utilized the TCGA-LUAD dataset to identify differentially expressed m5C-related genes (m5C-DEGs) and immune-related genes (IR-DEGs). The differentially expressed m5C-immune-related genes (DE-m5C-IRGs) were screened using Spearman correlation analysis, with a threshold of |Cor| > 0.5 and P < 0.05.\n\nTo build a prognostic signature, univariate Cox regression, LASSO regression, and the xgboost.surv tool were employed. These methods helped in identifying key genes associated with survival. The prognostic signature was then validated using independent datasets, including GSE31210, GSE68465, and ICGC-LUAD cohorts. These validation sets were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) databases.\n\nAdditionally, the study conducted gene functional enrichment analysis using the 'clusterProfiler' package to understand the biological pathways and processes involved. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed to identify significant pathways, such as the 'immune receptor activity' and 'PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.'\n\nThe prognostic signature's performance was further evaluated by comparing the survival probabilities between different risk subgroups using Kaplan-Meier (K-M) analysis and the log-rank test. The correlation between the risk score and clinical features was explored through the Chi-square test. The study also included an analysis of the immune microenvironment and immunotherapy responses between the risk subgroups.\n\nTo verify the expression of the prognostic genes at the transcription level, Quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was implemented. This involved collecting 10 carcinoma side normal tissue samples and 10 tumor samples from patients, with their informed consent. The expression levels of the prognostic genes were then compared between the normal and tumor samples.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our prognostic model for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), several performance metrics were employed to ensure a comprehensive assessment. The primary metrics reported include the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival curves. ROC curves were used to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the model at 1-, 3-, and 5-year intervals, providing a clear visualization of the model's sensitivity and specificity over time. The K-M survival curves were utilized to compare survival differences between patient subgroups, specifically those with low and high expression levels of differentially expressed m5C-immune-related genes (DE-m5C-IRGs) and those categorized by risk scores.\n\nAdditionally, the prognostic reliability of the model was assessed using the area under the ROC curve (AUC), which quantifies the model's ability to distinguish between high-risk and low-risk patients. The risk scores, calculated using the LASSO coefficients and gene expression levels, were used to stratify patients into low-risk and high-risk subgroups. The correlations between prognostic genes and risk scores were analyzed using the Spearman method, ensuring that the identified genes were significantly associated with patient outcomes.\n\nThe model's performance was further validated using external datasets, including GSE31210, GSE68465, and ICGC-LUAD cohorts, which served as verification sets. This external validation enhances the generalizability and robustness of our findings. Furthermore, the predictive performance of each prognostic gene was examined, and their expression patterns were displayed, providing additional insights into their potential clinical utility.\n\nIn summary, the reported performance metrics are representative of standard practices in the field, ensuring that our model's predictive accuracy and reliability are thoroughly evaluated. The use of ROC curves, K-M survival curves, and external validation datasets aligns with established methodologies in the literature, providing a comprehensive assessment of the model's effectiveness in predicting LUAD patient outcomes.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "Not applicable.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "Evaluation Confidence\n\nThe study employed several statistical methods to ensure the reliability and significance of the results. For instance, the differences in survival probabilities were compared using the log-rank test, which is a standard method for analyzing survival data. Additionally, the Wilcoxon test was used for statistical analysis of the risk groups, providing a non-parametric alternative to compare the distributions of two samples.\n\nThe correlation between risk scores and clinical features was explored through the Chi-square test, which is appropriate for categorical data. To address the issue of multiple comparisons, the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method was applied for P-value correction, helping to control the false discovery rate.\n\nIn the analysis of prognostic genes, univariate regression identified 27 survival-related candidate genes with a hazard ratio not equal to 1 and a P-value less than 0.05. This stringent criterion ensures that only genes with a significant impact on survival are considered. Furthermore, LASSO regression and the XGBoost algorithm were used to refine the list of key genes, providing a robust selection process.\n\nThe study also conducted a power analysis to determine the adequacy of the sample size. This involved setting the significance level at 0.05 and the desired level of statistical efficacy at 0.8, ensuring that the sample size was sufficient to detect meaningful effects. The effect sizes for t-tests were calculated based on RNA sequencing data, and the required sample size for key genes was determined using the R package pwr.\n\nOverall, the statistical methods and analyses employed in this study provide a high level of confidence in the results, ensuring that the findings are both reliable and significant.",
