  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our study falls under the class of artificial neural networks (ANNs). ANNs are computational models inspired by the structure and function of biological neurons, designed to recognize patterns and make predictions based on input data.\n\nThe specific ANN model used in this research is not a novel algorithm but rather a well-established approach in the field of machine learning. It leverages probabilistic learning methods to optimize its performance. The choice of ANN was driven by its proven efficacy in handling complex, non-linear relationships within data, making it suitable for predicting the response time of a microfluidic biosensor.\n\nThe decision to publish this work in a physics journal, rather than a machine-learning-specific journal, is rooted in the application domain. The primary focus of our study is the optimization of a microfluidic biosensor for rapid and accurate detection, which is crucial in the context of fighting pandemics such as COVID-19. The ANN serves as a tool to enhance the predictive accuracy of the biosensor's response time, aligning with the broader goals of improving medical technology and public health outcomes. Therefore, the journal selection reflects the interdisciplinary nature of the research, bridging advancements in machine learning with practical applications in physics and biomedical engineering.",
  "optimization/meta": "The subsection \"Meta-predictor\" is not applicable. The publication discusses the use of multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict the response time of a microfluidic biosensor. However, it does not mention the use of a meta-predictor that combines the outputs of different machine-learning algorithms. The comparison between MLR and ANN is based on their individual performances in predicting the response time, using metrics such as the value adjustment factor, root-mean-square error, mean absolute percentage error, and correlation coefficients. The study concludes that the ANN model is superior to the MLR model in terms of prediction accuracy and reliability.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several key steps to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of the model. Initially, the input parameters for the artificial neural network (ANN) were determined based on the orthogonal array (OA) design. These parameters included factors such as \u03b1, \u03b2, and X, which were crucial for modeling the response time of the microfluidic biosensor.\n\nThe data used for training the ANN was generated through a full factorial design based on the analysis of variance (ANOVA). This approach allowed for a comprehensive exploration of the parameter space, ensuring that the model could capture the underlying relationships effectively.\n\nTo optimize the ANN, multiple networks with varying numbers of hidden layer neurons were trained and tested. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was calculated for each configuration to identify the optimal number of neurons. The network with the minimum error percentage, which consisted of 15 neurons in the hidden layer, was selected for further analysis.\n\nThe transfer function used in the ANN was the log-sigmoid function, which is well-suited for modeling nonlinear relationships. The training algorithm employed was the Levenberg-Marquardt method, known for its efficiency in minimizing the mean squared error (MSE). Gradient descent with adaptive learning rate (LEARNGD) was used as the network algorithm to ensure stable and rapid convergence during training.\n\nThe performance of the ANN was evaluated using several metrics, including the value adjustment factor (VAF), root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and the correlation coefficient (R\u00b2). These metrics provided a comprehensive assessment of the model's predictive accuracy and reliability.\n\nIn summary, the data encoding and preprocessing involved the use of an orthogonal array design, full factorial design based on ANOVA, and the optimization of the ANN architecture. The selected transfer function, training algorithm, and performance metrics ensured that the model could accurately predict the response time of the microfluidic biosensor.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In the optimization process, three key parameters were identified and used as input for the model. These parameters are the inclination angle (\u03b1), the confinement coefficient (\u03b2), and the confinement position (X). The selection of these parameters was based on a numerical database and their significant influence on the response time of the microfluidic biosensor. The levels for each parameter were chosen to cover a range of values that would allow for effective optimization. The inclination angle (\u03b1) was set at three levels: 30\u00b0, 60\u00b0, and 90\u00b0. The confinement coefficient (\u03b2) was set at three levels: 0.1, 1.2, and 2.5. The confinement position (X) was set at three levels: 0 \u00b5m, 40 \u00b5m, and 80 \u00b5m. These parameters and their levels were used in the Taguchi method to minimize the response time of the microfluidic biosensor. The choice of these parameters and their levels was crucial in ensuring that the optimization process was both efficient and effective.",
  "optimization/features": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study utilized an artificial neural network (ANN) to model the response time of a microfluidic biosensor. The ANN was designed with a single hidden layer, and the optimal number of neurons in this layer was determined through extensive testing. The network with the minimum mean absolute percentage error (15 neurons in the hidden layer) was selected as the optimal configuration.\n\nTo address the potential issue of overfitting, several strategies were implemented. Firstly, the dataset was divided into training, validation, and testing subsets. The training subset was used to adjust the weights of the network, while the validation subset was used to tune the network's hyperparameters and monitor its performance during training. The testing subset was used to evaluate the final performance of the trained network on unseen data. This approach ensured that the network generalized well to new data and did not merely memorize the training examples.\n\nAdditionally, the performance of the ANN was compared to that of a multiple linear regression (MLR) model. The comparison involved evaluating several performance indices, including the value adjustment factor (VAF), root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and the coefficient of determination (R\u00b2). The ANN model demonstrated superior performance across all these metrics, indicating that it was not overfitting the data.\n\nTo rule out underfitting, the network's architecture and training process were carefully designed. The use of a non-linear activation function (log-sigmoid) allowed the network to capture complex relationships in the data. Furthermore, the training algorithm employed (Levenberg-Marquardt) is known for its efficiency in minimizing the mean squared error, which helped in achieving a good fit to the data. The high values of R\u00b2 (0.99 for testing and 0.98 for the simulation set) further confirm that the model was not underfitting.\n\nIn summary, the fitting method involved a well-structured approach to prevent both overfitting and underfitting. The use of validation and testing subsets, along with a comparison to an MLR model, ensured that the ANN provided a robust and generalizable solution for predicting the response time of the microfluidic biosensor.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our models. One of the key methods used was the adjustment of the correlation coefficient, specifically the adjusted R-squared (R2 adj). This metric accounts for the number of predictors in the model, providing a more accurate indication of the model's fit, especially when dealing with multiple variables. By focusing on the adjusted R-squared, we aimed to balance model complexity and performance, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized cross-validation techniques to evaluate the performance of our models. This involved dividing the dataset into training, validation, and testing subsets. The models were trained on the training data, validated on the validation set, and finally tested on the testing set. This approach helped in assessing the model's generalization capability and ensured that it performed well on unseen data, thus mitigating overfitting.\n\nFurthermore, we compared the performance of multiple models, including multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural networks (ANN). The comparison was based on various metrics such as the value adjustment factor (VAF), root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and the correlation coefficient (R2). This comparative analysis allowed us to select the most efficient and reliable model for predicting the response time of the microfluidic biosensor.\n\nIn summary, our approach to preventing overfitting involved the use of adjusted R-squared, cross-validation, and a thorough comparison of different models. These techniques collectively ensured that our models were robust, generalizable, and capable of providing accurate predictions.",
  "optimization/config": "The configuration details for the optimization process are thoroughly documented within the publication. The model configuration, including the transfer function, training algorithm, network algorithm, and performance function, is explicitly provided in a table. This table outlines the specific parameters used, such as the log sigmoid transfer function, Levenberg\u2013Marquardt training algorithm, gradient descent network algorithm, and mean squared error performance function.\n\nThe optimization process involved training several networks with varying numbers of hidden layer neurons to determine the optimal configuration. The mean absolute percentage error as a function of the number of neurons in the hidden layer is illustrated in a figure, which helps in identifying the network with the minimum error percentage. The optimal network, which had 15 neurons in the hidden layer, was selected based on this analysis.\n\nAdditionally, the response time obtained through numerical simulation and predicted by the ANN model is compared in another table. This table includes experimental test factors, the response time from both the experiment and the ANN model, and the percentage error between them. This comparison affirms the consistency and accuracy of the ANN model.\n\nThe performance indices, such as RMSE, VAF, MAPE, R2, and R2adj, for different models are also presented in a table. These indices indicate that the ANN model demonstrated the best prediction performance compared to the multiple linear regression (MLR) model.\n\nThe best validation performance for the response time was achieved at epoch 20, where the gradient was 6.4353 \u00d7 10\u22125. This information is crucial for understanding the training process and the convergence of the model.\n\nThe optimal combination of factors, including the angle \u03b1, confinement coefficient \u03b2, and channel position X, was determined using a genetic algorithm in MATLAB. This combination resulted in the minimum response time, which was validated against the optimal combination obtained through ANOVA analysis.\n\nIn summary, all relevant hyper-parameter configurations, optimization schedules, and model files are reported within the publication. The details are presented in tables and figures, providing a comprehensive overview of the optimization process and the performance of the ANN model. The publication adheres to standard reporting practices, ensuring that the information is accessible and reproducible.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model discussed in this publication includes both multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) approaches for predicting the response time of a microfluidic biosensor. The MLR model is more transparent and interpretable compared to the ANN model.\n\nThe MLR model provides a clear equation that relates the response time (TR) to various input variables. The equation is given by:\n\nTR = 5.609 \u2212 0.00789\u03b1 \u2212 0.0486\u03b2 + 0.01833X\n\nHere, \u03b1 represents the inclination angle, \u03b2 represents the confinement coefficient, and X represents the confinement position. The coefficients in this equation indicate the strength and direction of the relationship between each input variable and the response time. For example, a negative coefficient for \u03b2 suggests that as the confinement coefficient increases, the response time decreases, assuming other variables remain constant. This transparency allows for straightforward interpretation and understanding of how each factor influences the response time.\n\nIn contrast, the ANN model is more of a black-box model. While it can provide highly accurate predictions, the internal workings of the model are not as easily interpretable. The ANN model uses a complex network of nodes and layers to process input data and generate predictions. The relationships between input variables and the output are encoded in the weights and biases of the network, which are not directly interpretable. However, the ANN model's performance metrics, such as a high correlation coefficient (R\u00b2 = 0.99) and low root-mean-square error (RMSE = 0.10), indicate its effectiveness in predicting response times.\n\nIn summary, the MLR model offers transparency and interpretability through its clear equation and coefficients, while the ANN model, though highly accurate, operates more as a black-box. The choice between these models depends on the trade-off between interpretability and predictive accuracy.",
  "model/output": "The model discussed in this publication is a regression model. Specifically, it employs both Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict the response time (TR) of a microfluidic biosensor. The ANN model, in particular, is used to regress through training, validation, and testing phases, aiming for an R value close to 1, which indicates a strong correlation between predicted and actual values. The performance of these models is evaluated using various metrics such as the value adjustment factor (VAF), root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and the correlation coefficient (R\u00b2). The ANN model demonstrates superior predictive performance compared to the MLR model, as evidenced by higher R\u00b2 values and lower error metrics. This makes the ANN model more suitable for predicting the response time of the microfluidic biosensor.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time of the model was evaluated through numerical simulation and prediction by an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. The response time, denoted as TR, was compared across various experimental tests. For instance, in one of the tests, the experimental response time (TR Exp) was 5.3769 minutes, while the ANN-predicted response time (TR ANN) was 5.3834 minutes, resulting in a minimal error of 0.121%. This indicates that the ANN model closely matches the experimental data, suggesting efficient execution time.\n\nThe model's performance was further validated using multiple metrics, including the mean squared error (MSE) gradients, which were plotted as a function of the number of epochs during training. The best validation performance was achieved at epoch 20, with a gradient of 6.4353 \u00d7 10^-5. This optimization process ensures that the model runs efficiently without unnecessary computational overhead.\n\nAdditionally, the ANN model demonstrated superior prediction performance compared to the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model. The ANN model achieved a higher value adjustment factor (VAF) of 98.64% and a lower root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.10 minutes, indicating more accurate and faster predictions. The correlation coefficient (R2) for the ANN model was 0.99, which is significantly higher than the R2 of 0.73 for the MLR model, further confirming the efficiency and reliability of the ANN model's execution time.\n\nIn summary, the ANN model's execution time is optimized and efficient, providing accurate predictions with minimal error and high correlation to experimental data.",
  "model/availability": "Not applicable",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method for the predictive models involved several key metrics to assess their performance. These metrics included the value adjustment factor (VAF), root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), correlation coefficient (R\u00b2), and adjusted R\u00b2. The VAF indicates how well the model's predictions match the actual values, with a value of 100 suggesting an excellent model. RMSE measures the average magnitude of the errors between predicted and actual values, where a lower value indicates better performance. MAPE provides the average absolute percentage error, giving insight into the accuracy of the predictions. The correlation coefficient (R\u00b2) assesses the goodness of fit, with values closer to 1 indicating a better fit. Adjusted R\u00b2 accounts for the number of predictors in the model, providing a more accurate measure of fit when multiple variables are involved.\n\nThe models were evaluated using regression analysis, cross-correlation of predicted and actual values, and learning behavior analysis. Regression analysis was performed to compare the values calculated numerically with the finite element method and the predicted values from the artificial neural network (ANN) for the response time (TR) during training, validation, testing, and assembly. Cross-correlation plots were used to visualize the relationship between predicted and actual values, with a high correlation coefficient indicating strong predictive performance. Learning behavior analysis showed how the ANN model improved over time, with correlation coefficients of 0.89 for training, 0.97 for validation, 0.999 for testing, and 0.998 for the simulation set, demonstrating the model's robustness.\n\nAdditionally, a comparative study was conducted between multiple linear regression (MLR) and ANN models. The performance of these models was evaluated using the aforementioned metrics and visualized through Taylor diagrams, which show the correlation coefficient, RMSE, and standard deviation. The ANN model outperformed the MLR model in terms of prediction accuracy, as evidenced by higher VAF and R\u00b2 values, and lower RMSE and MAPE. The ANN model's predictions were also closer to the observed values, indicating its superior capability in predicting the response time of the microfluidic biosensor.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed several performance metrics to evaluate the predictive models used for the response time of a microfluidic biosensor. These metrics include the value adjustment factor (VAF), root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), correlation coefficient (R\u00b2), and adjusted R\u00b2. The VAF indicates how well the model's predictions match the actual values, with higher values signifying better performance. RMSE measures the average magnitude of the errors between predicted and actual values, where lower values are desirable. MAPE provides the average absolute percentage error, offering a percentage-based measure of prediction accuracy. The correlation coefficient (R\u00b2) assesses the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables, with values closer to 1 indicating a better fit. The adjusted R\u00b2 accounts for the number of predictors in the model, providing a more accurate measure when multiple variables are involved.\n\nThese metrics are widely used in the literature for evaluating the performance of predictive models, particularly in the context of regression analysis and neural network models. They provide a comprehensive view of model accuracy, precision, and reliability. By reporting these metrics, we ensure that our evaluation is thorough and comparable to other studies in the field. The use of RMSE, MAPE, and R\u00b2 is standard practice in assessing model performance, while the inclusion of VAF and adjusted R\u00b2 adds depth to our analysis, making it more robust and representative of the model's true predictive power.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we conducted a thorough comparison of different predictive models to evaluate their performance in predicting the response time of a microfluidic biosensor. Specifically, we compared the multiple linear regression (MLR) model and the artificial neural network (ANN) model against results obtained from the finite element method.\n\nWe used several performance metrics to assess the models, including the value adjustment factor (VAF), root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), correlation coefficient (R\u00b2), and adjusted R\u00b2. These metrics provided a comprehensive evaluation of the models' predictive accuracy and reliability.\n\nThe ANN model demonstrated superior performance across all metrics. For instance, the VAF for the ANN model was 98.64%, significantly higher than the 73.23% achieved by the MLR model. Similarly, the RMSE for the ANN model was 0.10 minutes, compared to 0.45 minutes for the MLR model. The correlation coefficient (R\u00b2) for the ANN model was 0.99, indicating a very strong fit, whereas the MLR model had an R\u00b2 of 0.73, suggesting a weaker fit.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized Taylor diagrams to visually compare the models' performance. The ANN model's predictions were closest to the observed values, further confirming its superiority. The deviation intervals for the ANN model were smaller, indicating more accurate predictions.\n\nIn summary, our comparison showed that the ANN model outperformed the MLR model in predicting the response time of the microfluidic biosensor. This conclusion is supported by the quantitative metrics and visual representations used in our evaluation.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the models' performance involved several key metrics, including the value adjustment factor (VAF), root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), correlation coefficient (R\u00b2), and adjusted R\u00b2. These metrics were used to compare the multiple linear regression (MLR) model and the artificial neural network (ANN) model in predicting the response time of a microfluidic biosensor.\n\nTo assess the statistical significance of the results, a Taylor diagram was employed. This diagram, developed by Karl E. Taylor, provides a visual representation of the models' performance using three statistics: Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient, RMSE, and standard deviation. The Taylor diagram indicated that the ANN model's predictions were statistically significant, with a high correlation coefficient (R\u00b2) and a standard deviation close to the observed values. In contrast, the MLR model did not show statistical significance since its R\u00b2 value was less than 0.9.\n\nThe comparative study also included a detailed analysis of the deviation intervals of the predicted values from the observed values. The ANN model demonstrated smaller deviation intervals compared to the MLR model, further supporting its superior performance. Additionally, the ANN model's values for R\u00b2, adjusted R\u00b2, RMSE, MAE, and VAF were significantly better than those of the MLR model, as illustrated in the Taylor diagram and supporting tables.\n\nThe Pareto chart was used to determine the magnitude and significance of the effects of the optimization factors. The confinement channel position (X) was identified as the most influential factor, with a statistically significant effect at the 0.05 level. This analysis underscored the importance of the confinement channel position in optimizing the response time of the microfluidic biosensor.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation confidence is high due to the use of robust statistical methods and performance metrics. The ANN model's superior performance is well-supported by the data, making it the preferred choice for predicting the response time of the microfluidic biosensor.",
