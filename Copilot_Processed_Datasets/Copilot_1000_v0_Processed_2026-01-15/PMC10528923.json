  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study consists of tumor samples from 59 patients who had not undergone any chemotherapy or radiation treatments prior to sample collection. These samples were obtained directly from the operating room following surgical resection. The tissue samples were processed and homogenized using established methods, and then analyzed using a commercially available 41-plex immunology multiplex assay. This assay was chosen to encompass a broad panel of chemokines and cytokines, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of the inflammatory milieu within the tumor microenvironment.\n\nThe data obtained from the multiplex assay were visualized using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), a machine-learning method that helps in identifying patterns in high-dimensional data. This analysis revealed two distinct clusters of inflammatory phenotypes, labeled as immunomodulating and immunostimulating. The dataset includes a variety of clinicopathologic variables, which were compared using appropriate statistical tests such as the Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables and Fisher\u2019s exact test for categorical variables. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test.\n\nThe dataset has not been used in previous publications by the community, as this is the first study to apply a protein-based machine learning approach to identify inflammatory subtypes in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The findings from this study provide a foundation for further research into how these inflammatory subtypes may influence treatment response and potentially elucidate targetable mechanisms within the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in our study is t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). This is a well-established technique for visualizing high-dimensional data by reducing its dimensionality while preserving the structure of the data.\n\nThe t-SNE algorithm is not new; it has been widely used in various fields, including bioinformatics and computational biology, for several years. It is particularly useful for exploring and visualizing complex datasets, such as those involving multiple inflammatory proteins.\n\nThe reason t-SNE was not published in a machine-learning journal in the context of this study is that our primary focus was on applying this established method to a specific biological problem\u2014identifying inflammatory subtypes in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The innovation lies in the application of t-SNE to this particular medical challenge rather than in the development of a new algorithm. Our study contributes to the understanding of PDAC by leveraging existing machine-learning techniques to uncover novel insights into the disease's inflammatory milieu.",
  "optimization/meta": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the machine-learning algorithm, the data encoding and preprocessing involved several steps. Initially, tissue samples were collected directly from the operating room following surgical resection and were transported on ice in DMEM. These samples were then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00b0C. The tissues were processed and homogenized using a previously described method. They were sharply divided into 30 mg pieces, and 500 \u00b5L of cell lysis buffer with protease/phosphatase inhibitor was added. Bead homogenization was performed for three cycles at 50 Hz for 40 seconds, with the samples placed on ice between each cycle for 2 minutes. The lysates were then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 13,000 RCF.\n\nThe tissue homogenates were probed using a commercially available 41-plex immunology multiplex assay, which was normalized to total protein. This assay was selected to encompass a large inflammatory panel of chemokines/cytokines, allowing for a broad assessment of the inflammatory milieu. The data were obtained through the MAGPIX system and analyzed using MILLIPLEX Analyst 5.1.\n\nFor the machine-learning analysis, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) was employed. This method is a machine-learning technique used for visualizing high-dimensional data by assigning similar objects a higher probability while dissimilar points are assigned a lower probability. Several cytokines in the multiplex assay were excluded from the t-SNE analysis due to non-informative data. These included GCSF, IL-9, IL-1B, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, MIP-1A, and TNFB. The t-SNE analysis was performed for perplexity values ranging from 5 to 15, and all iterations showed a clear separation of the data into two distinct groups, labeled as immunomodulating and immunostimulating.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized a multiplex assay to measure 41 unique inflammatory proteins from tumor samples. However, not all of these proteins were informative for our analysis. Specifically, several cytokines were excluded from the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis due to non-informative data. These included GCSF, IL-9, IL-1B, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, MIP-1A, and TNFB.\n\nThe selection of the perplexity parameter for t-SNE was carefully considered. We performed t-SNE analysis for perplexity values ranging from 5 to 15. All iterations of this analysis consistently showed separation of the data into two distinct groups, which we labeled as immunomodulating and immunostimulating. This consistency across different perplexity values suggests that the choice of perplexity within this range did not significantly affect the identification of these two clusters.\n\nThe final model used for clustering was based on the analysis of 32 inflammatory proteins, as some were excluded due to the reasons mentioned earlier. This subset of proteins was sufficient to identify two distinct inflammatory phenotypes in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The selection of these proteins was guided by their relevance to the inflammatory milieu and their potential to differentiate between the two identified clusters.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized 41 unique inflammatory proteins as input features for our machine learning analysis. These features were selected based on their relevance to the inflammatory milieu within the tumor microenvironment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).\n\nFeature selection was inherently performed by excluding certain cytokines from the analysis due to non-informative data. Specifically, cytokines such as GCSF, IL-9, IL-1B, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, MIP-1A, and TNFB were excluded because they did not provide meaningful information for the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis. This exclusion was based on the quality and informativeness of the data rather than a traditional feature selection method applied to the training set.\n\nThe final set of features used in the t-SNE analysis consisted of 32 inflammatory proteins, which were found to be informative and relevant for clustering the inflammatory phenotypes of PDAC. This process ensured that only the most relevant and informative features were included in the analysis, enhancing the robustness and interpretability of the results.",
  "optimization/fitting": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/regularization": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/config": "Not applicable.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a black box but rather a transparent approach that leverages t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) for visualizing high-dimensional data. t-SNE is a machine-learning method that assigns similar objects a higher probability while dissimilar points are assigned a lower probability, making it an interpretable tool for clustering and visualizing complex datasets.\n\nOne of the clear examples of the model's transparency is the identification of two distinct clusters of inflammatory phenotypes in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). These clusters, labeled as immunomodulating and immunostimulating, were consistently separated across different perplexity values in the t-SNE analysis. This separation allowed for a detailed examination of the differences in inflammatory proteins between the two groups.\n\nFurthermore, the model's transparency is evident in the specific inflammatory proteins that were found to be significantly different between the two clusters. Proteins such as FGF-2, IL-1RA, TGF-\u03b1, Flt-3L, TNF-\u03b1, IL-15, IL-1\u03b1, IL-10, MDC, and Fractalkine showed notable differences, providing clear insights into the biological mechanisms underlying the inflammatory subtypes.\n\nThe model's ability to identify these distinct clusters and the associated inflammatory proteins highlights its interpretability. This transparency is crucial for understanding the underlying biology and for potential clinical applications, such as tailoring treatments based on the inflammatory phenotype of the tumor.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in this study is primarily a classification model. It utilizes t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), a machine-learning method designed for visualizing high-dimensional data. This technique assigns similar objects a higher probability while assigning dissimilar points a lower probability, effectively clustering data into distinct groups. In this case, the model identified two distinct clusters of inflammatory phenotypes within pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) samples. These clusters were labeled as immunomodulating and immunostimulating, indicating that the model is used for classification purposes rather than regression. The analysis involved 32 inflammatory proteins and successfully differentiated between the two groups based on their inflammatory profiles.",

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method employed in this study involved a comprehensive analysis of inflammatory proteins in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor samples using a machine-learning approach. The primary technique used was t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), a machine-learning method designed for visualizing high-dimensional data. This method assigns a higher probability to similar objects and a lower probability to dissimilar points, facilitating the identification of distinct clusters within the data.\n\nThe study analyzed 59 tumor samples from patients who had not undergone any chemotherapy or radiation treatments. These samples were homogenized and probed for 41 unique inflammatory proteins using a multiplex assay. The t-SNE analysis was performed for perplexity values ranging from 5 to 15, and all iterations consistently showed separation of the data into two distinct groups: an immunomodulating group and an immunostimulating group.\n\nTo ensure the robustness of the findings, several statistical analyses were conducted. The results of the multiplex assay were analyzed using t-SNE, and specific cytokines were excluded from the analysis due to non-informative data. Clinicopathologic data were obtained through a retrospective review of electronic medical records and compared using appropriate statistical tests, such as the Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables and Fisher\u2019s exact test for categorical variables. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. Statistical significance for multiple comparison analysis was determined using the Bonferroni correction at a p-value threshold of less than 0.0015.\n\nThe evaluation also included a detailed comparison of inflammatory proteins between the two identified clusters. Ten out of 32 inflammatory proteins showed significant differences between the immunomodulating and immunostimulating groups, with notable differences in proteins such as FGF-2, IL-1RA, TGF-\u03b1, Flt-3L, TNF-\u03b1, IL-15, IL-1\u03b1, IL-10, MDC, and Fractalkine. Additionally, the study examined the impact of tumor location and operative blood loss, finding that patients in the immunostimulating group experienced significantly less intraoperative blood loss. The survival analysis indicated that the immunostimulating group trended towards a longer median survival, although this difference did not reach statistical significance.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed several performance metrics to evaluate the distinct inflammatory phenotypes identified in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients. The primary method used for visualizing and analyzing high-dimensional data was t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). This machine-learning technique assigns higher probabilities to similar objects and lower probabilities to dissimilar points, allowing for the clear separation of data into distinct clusters.\n\nWe analyzed 32 inflammatory proteins and identified two main clusters: an immunomodulating group and an immunostimulating group. The statistical significance of the differences between these groups was determined using a Bonferroni correction at a p-value threshold of less than 0.0015. This stringent threshold ensured that the identified differences were robust and not due to random chance.\n\nFor comparing clinicopathologic data, we used the Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables and Fisher\u2019s exact test for categorical variables. These tests are standard in the literature for comparing differences between two independent groups. Survival analysis was conducted using the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences in survival were assessed using the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. These methods are widely accepted and commonly used in survival analysis studies.\n\nThe set of metrics reported in our study is representative of those used in similar research in the field. The use of t-SNE for dimensionality reduction and clustering is well-established in bioinformatics and medical research. The statistical tests employed for comparing demographic and clinical variables, as well as survival analysis, are standard practices in the literature. This ensures that our findings are comparable to other studies in the domain of PDAC and inflammatory phenotypes.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "Not applicable.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The statistical analysis employed in this study was rigorous and aimed to ensure the reliability of the findings. The results of the multiplex assay were analyzed using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), a machine-learning method that visualizes high-dimensional data by assigning similar objects a higher probability and dissimilar points a lower probability. This approach helped in identifying two distinct clusters of inflammatory phenotypes.\n\nThe statistical significance for multiple comparison analysis was determined using the Bonferroni correction at p < 0.0015. This stringent threshold ensures that the results are robust and not due to chance. Several inflammatory proteins showed significant differences between the immunomodulating and immunostimulating groups, with p-values well below the Bonferroni-corrected threshold. For instance, proteins like FGF-2, IL-1RA, TGF-\u03b1, and others had p-values as low as < 0.0001, indicating strong statistical significance.\n\nThe study also compared clinicopathologic data using appropriate statistical tests: Mann-Whitney for continuous variables and Fisher\u2019s exact test for categorical variables. Survival analysis was conducted using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. These methods are well-established in the field and provide a reliable framework for evaluating differences in survival between groups.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics in this study are supported by robust statistical methods and significant p-values, providing confidence in the claims that the identified inflammatory phenotypes are distinct and meaningful. The use of the Bonferroni correction further strengthens the reliability of the findings, ensuring that the observed differences are not due to random variation.",
