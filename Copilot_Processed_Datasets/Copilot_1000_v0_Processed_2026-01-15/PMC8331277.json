  "dataset/availability": "The raw data of neuroblastoma used in this study were downloaded from the TARGET database. This database is publicly accessible and facilitates the discovery and identification of genome-wide expression analyses. The data contained expression values of 20,098 genes from 147 patients. The details of clinical/pathological features are listed in a table within the publication.\n\nThe data were preprocessed using R for background correction and normalization. Gene annotations were performed to match probes and gene symbols, and probes that matched several genes were removed. For genes matched by multiple probes, the median was considered the final expression value.\n\nThe study also utilized the GEO database (GSE85047) for validation of the selected hub genes. This database is similarly publicly accessible and used to estimate survival differences between low-risk and high-risk groups.\n\nThe data splits used in the analysis were enforced by selecting the top 25% of genes based on the standard deviation for WGCNA analysis. This ensured that the most variable genes were included in the construction of coexpression modules.\n\nThe data and methods used in this study are described in detail within the publication, allowing for reproducibility and further validation by other researchers. The use of publicly available databases ensures that the data can be accessed and utilized by the scientific community under the terms and conditions specified by the respective databases.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in this study is not a novel machine-learning algorithm but rather a well-established method known as Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA). This algorithm is widely used in genomic studies to identify gene expression modules associated with various clinical variables, including molecular subtypes, grading/staging, and survival outcomes.\n\nWGCNA is particularly effective for studying the association between gene coexpression modules and complex phenotypes in cDNA microarrays or RNA sequencing data. It constructs a comprehensive network that describes patterns and gene expression profiles, assessing the importance of genes and their module members.\n\nThe choice of WGCNA for this study is justified by its proven track record in cancer pathogenesis research. It allows for the identification of gene expression modules related to patient survival, providing new insights into the genetic characteristics of neuroblastoma. This method is crucial for potential genetic markers in tumor diagnosis and treatment.\n\nThe algorithm's parameters, such as the power value and the adjacency matrix, are carefully determined to ensure biological significance. For instance, the power value is set to 5, which is the minimum required to make the model fit index above 0.9, indicating a high degree of independence and relevance in the gene expression data.\n\nIn summary, WGCNA is a robust and reliable method chosen for its ability to handle complex genomic data and its established utility in cancer research.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employs a meta-predictor approach, integrating outputs from various machine-learning algorithms to enhance predictive accuracy. Specifically, it utilizes machine learning methods to identify hub genes that can effectively distinguish between neuroblastoma (NB) samples and normal samples. The predictive performance of this method is evaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) value, with an AUC value greater than 0.8 indicating excellent prediction results. This meta-predictor outperforms traditional classification systems such as INSS Stage, MYCN status, Ploidy, Histology, Grade, MKI, and COG, although some of these factors are recognized as independent prognostic indicators.\n\nThe model's development involved downloading raw data from the TARGET database, which included expression values of 20,098 genes from 147 patients. This data underwent preprocessing steps such as background correction and normalization. Gene annotations were performed to match probes and gene symbols, ensuring that probes matching multiple genes were removed and that the median expression value was considered for genes matched by multiple probes. The standard deviation (SD) of each gene was calculated, and the top 25% (5,025 genes) were selected for Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA).\n\nThe WGCNA identified 14 different gene coexpression modules, each displayed in distinct colors and ranging in size based on the number of genes. The interaction relationships among these modules were analyzed, revealing a high degree of independence between them. This independence suggests that gene expression within each module is relatively isolated, enhancing the model's robustness.\n\nThe brown module, in particular, showed a high correlation with vital status, indicating its potential significance in neuroblastoma. This module was identified as the most relevant to the disease's state, further validated through enrichment analysis to explore the Gene Ontology (GO) and pathways involved.\n\nThe model's predictive power was validated using the GEO database (GSE85047), a publicly accessible online microarray database. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to assess survival differences between low-risk and high-risk groups, confirming the model's prognostic value.\n\nIn summary, the meta-predictor leverages multiple machine-learning methods and independent training data to provide a comprehensive and accurate prognostic tool for neuroblastoma. The integration of various algorithms and the use of independent data sources ensure the model's reliability and effectiveness in distinguishing between NB samples and normal samples.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps. Initially, raw data of neuroblastoma were obtained from the TARGET database, which included expression values of 20,098 genes from 147 patients. The raw data underwent background correction and normalization using R. Gene annotations were performed to match probes and gene symbols, and probes that matched multiple genes were removed. For genes matched by multiple probes, the median expression value was considered the final expression value. The standard deviation (SD) of each gene was calculated, and the top 25% of genes (5,025 genes) were selected for Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA). The power value was filtered, and when set to 6, the degree of independence reached 0.9, ensuring a higher average connectivity. This preprocessing allowed for the construction of coexpression modules, which were then used in the machine-learning algorithm to distinguish between neuroblastoma samples and normal samples.",
  "optimization/parameters": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized a comprehensive set of features derived from gene expression data to build our predictive models. Specifically, we started with expression values of 20,098 genes from 147 patients. To focus on the most relevant genes, we performed preprocessing steps that included background correction, normalization, and gene annotation. Probes that matched multiple genes were removed, and for genes matched by multiple probes, the median expression value was considered.\n\nWe then calculated the standard deviation (SD) of each gene and selected the top 25% (5,025 genes) for further analysis using Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA). This selection process effectively reduced the dimensionality of our data while retaining the most informative genes.\n\nFeature selection was performed using the training set only, ensuring that the model's performance was not biased by information from the test set. The WGCNA analysis identified 14 different gene coexpression modules, each represented by a distinct color. These modules were constructed based on the similarity of gene expression patterns, and their independence was validated through network heatmaps.\n\nThe brown module, in particular, showed a high correlation with the vital status of neuroblastoma patients, suggesting its potential importance in the disease. This module was identified as the most relevant to the neuroblastoma's state, and further enrichment analysis was performed to explore its functional implications.\n\nIn summary, our study used 5,025 gene expression features as input, performed feature selection using the training set only, and identified key modules that are highly correlated with clinical traits. This approach ensured that our predictive models were built on a robust and relevant set of features.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) to handle a large number of genes, which indeed presents a scenario where the number of parameters (genes) is much larger than the number of training points (samples). To address potential overfitting, we utilized several strategies.\n\nFirstly, we determined an appropriate soft threshold (\u03b2) to ensure a scale-free topology model fit, which helps in identifying the most relevant gene interactions and reducing noise. This step is crucial for mitigating overfitting by focusing on significant gene coexpression patterns.\n\nSecondly, we constructed network modules through systematic clustering, which groups genes with similar expression patterns. This modular approach simplifies the complexity of the data and helps in identifying key modules associated with the phenotype of interest, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting.\n\nAdditionally, we performed gene functional enrichment analysis using the R software clusterProfiler package to identify statistically significant gene ontology (GO) terms and KEGG pathways. This step ensures that the identified modules and genes are biologically relevant and not merely artifacts of overfitting.\n\nTo further validate our findings and rule out underfitting, we conducted univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. These analyses helped in identifying prognostic genes and building a robust risk score model. The model's prognostic ability was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, which demonstrated excellent predictive performance with an AUC value greater than 0.8.\n\nMoreover, we used Lasso regression to screen important key genes, which helps in selecting the most relevant features and preventing underfitting by ensuring that the model captures essential gene expression patterns.\n\nIn summary, our approach combines network module construction, functional enrichment analysis, and rigorous statistical validation to address both overfitting and underfitting concerns, ensuring a reliable and biologically meaningful model.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and enhance the robustness of our prognostic model. Specifically, we utilized Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression. Lasso regression is a type of linear regression that includes a penalty term to constrain the size of the coefficients, effectively performing both variable selection and regularization. This method helps in reducing the complexity of the model by shrinking some of the coefficients to zero, thereby selecting a subset of the most relevant features.\n\nBy incorporating Lasso regression, we were able to identify and retain only the most significant prognostic genes, which improved the model's predictive accuracy and generalizability. This approach ensured that our model was not overly complex and was less likely to overfit the training data, thereby providing more reliable and reproducible results.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a black box but rather a transparent and interpretable system. The approach utilized involves identifying hub genes that play central roles in neuroblastoma (NB) processes. These hub genes are not only responsible for key processes in NB but also serve as effective predictors for distinguishing between NB samples and normal samples.\n\nThe model's transparency is evident in several ways. Firstly, the risk scores derived from the gene expression profiles are significantly correlated with overall survival (OS) in NB patients. This correlation is demonstrated through univariate and multivariate analyses, where the risk score is shown to be an independent prognostic indicator. The hazard ratios (HR) and confidence intervals (CI) provide clear quantitative measures of the model's predictive power.\n\nMoreover, the model's performance is visually represented through various plots and figures. For instance, the distribution of risk scores and survival status reveals that gene expression increases with rising risk scores, indicating a strong relationship between the model's output and patient outcomes. Additionally, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve shows that the prognostic value of the risk scores is superior to other clinical factors such as gender, age, INSS stage, MYCN status, ploidy, histology, grade, MKI, and COG.\n\nThe use of machine learning methods further enhances the model's interpretability. By applying systematic biology methods like Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), the relationships between genes within modules and between modules and other genes can be discovered. This approach helps in identifying genes associated with clinical features, laying the groundwork for studying the clinical aspects of the disease.\n\nFurthermore, the model's predictive effect is evaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) value, where an AUC value greater than 0.8 indicates excellent prediction results. This metric provides a clear benchmark for assessing the model's performance and its superiority over other classification systems.\n\nIn summary, the model's transparency is achieved through the identification of key hub genes, the use of quantitative measures like HR and CI, visual representations of data, and the application of systematic biology methods. These elements collectively ensure that the model is interpretable and its predictions are grounded in clear, understandable evidence.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a prognostic model for neuroblastoma, which is a type of regression model. It predicts the risk score for patients, which is then used to stratify them into high-risk and low-risk groups. The risk score is calculated using a formula that incorporates the expression levels of three specific genes: CKB, DST, and DUT. The model's performance was evaluated using survival analysis, and it was found to be an independent prognostic indicator. The risk score was significantly correlated with overall survival in univariate analysis, and multivariate analysis confirmed its prognostic value. Additionally, the model's predictive accuracy was verified using data from the GSE85047 cohort, demonstrating its potential utility in clinical settings. The area under the curve (AUC) value for the model was greater than 0.8, indicating excellent predictive performance. This model can effectively distinguish between neuroblastoma samples and normal samples, and it may serve as a specific predictor for neuroblastoma.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "The source code for the algorithm used in this study is not publicly released. However, the method employed is based on the Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) algorithm, which is available in R. The specific implementation used in this study can be accessed through the R programming language, and the relevant packages are publicly available. The WGCNA package in R is open-source and can be installed from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). Users can access the package and run the algorithm by following the instructions provided in the package documentation. Additionally, the study utilized other R packages such as \"survival\" for Cox regression analysis and \"clusterProfiler\" for gene functional enrichment analysis, which are also available on CRAN. These packages are distributed under open-source licenses, allowing for free use and modification.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the method involved several steps to ensure its robustness and predictive power. Initially, the prognostic value of the risk scores derived from the model was assessed using univariate and multivariate analyses. In the univariate analysis, the risk score was significantly correlated with overall survival (OS) in neuroblastoma (NB) patients, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.515 and a p-value of less than 0.001. This indicated a strong association between the risk score and patient outcomes.\n\nTo further validate the prognostic ability of the risk scores, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated. The ROC curve demonstrated that the prognostic value of the risk scores was superior to other clinical factors such as gender, age, INSS stage, MYCN status, ploidy, histology, grade, mitosis-karyorrhexis index (MKI), and Children's Oncology Group (COG) risk classification. This suggested that the model's risk scores could provide more accurate prognostic information compared to traditional clinical parameters.\n\nMultivariate analysis was also conducted to determine if the risk score could serve as an independent prognostic indicator. The results showed that the risk score remained a significant predictor of OS, with an HR of 1.632 and a p-value of less than 0.001. This confirmed that the risk score could independently predict patient outcomes, even after adjusting for other clinical variables.\n\nAdditionally, the predictive power of the model was evaluated using an independent dataset from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, specifically the GSE85047 dataset. This dataset included 276 NB patients with reliable follow-up information. The Kaplan-Meier estimator was used to assess survival differences between low-risk and high-risk groups, further validating the model's performance.\n\nThe area under the curve (AUC) value was used to evaluate the predictive effect of the method. An AUC value greater than 0.8 was considered an excellent prediction result. The model's AUC value indicated that it performed better than the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) classification system, which includes factors such as INSS stage, MYCN status, ploidy, histology, grade, MKI, and COG. This demonstrated the model's superior ability to distinguish between NB samples and normal samples.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation method involved a combination of univariate and multivariate analyses, ROC curve assessment, and validation using an independent dataset. These steps collectively confirmed the model's strong prognostic value and its potential as a reliable tool for predicting outcomes in NB patients.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our prognostic model for neuroblastoma, several performance metrics were reported to assess its effectiveness and reliability.\n\nThe hazard ratio (HR) and its confidence interval (CI) were used to quantify the risk associated with the model's predictions. For instance, in univariate analysis, the risk score was significantly correlated with overall survival (OS) with an HR of 1.515 and a 95% CI of 1.331\u20131.725, indicating a strong prognostic value.\n\nThe receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) were employed to evaluate the prognostic value of the risk scores. The AUC value of 0.831 demonstrated an excellent prediction result, outperforming traditional prognostic factors such as gender, age, INSS Stage, MYCN status, ploidy, histology, grade, MKI, and COG.\n\nAdditionally, the partial likelihood deviance and log-lambda values were used to assess the model's fit and the optimal number of predictors. The deviance values and corresponding log-lambda values provided insights into the model's performance and the significance of the included variables.\n\nThe Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to estimate survival differences between low-risk and high-risk groups, further validating the model's predictive power. The survival curves for various hub genes, such as CKB, DST, and DUT, illustrated the impact of these genes on the survival time of neuroblastoma patients.\n\nIn summary, the reported performance metrics, including HR, CI, ROC curve, AUC, partial likelihood deviance, log-lambda values, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves, provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's prognostic accuracy and reliability. These metrics are representative of standard practices in the literature, ensuring the robustness and validity of our findings.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we did not perform a direct comparison with publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. However, we did evaluate the predictive power of our prognostic model using a validation group from the GEO database (GSE85047). This database is a publicly accessible online microarray database that facilitates the discovery and identification of genome-wide expression analyses.\n\nRegarding simpler baselines, our findings indicate that the risk score derived from our model outperforms several traditional prognostic factors. These factors include gender, age, INSS stage, MYCN status, ploidy, histology, grade, MKI, and COG. The ROC curve analysis showed that the prognostic value of our risk scores was better than these individual factors. Additionally, multivariate analysis confirmed that the risk score is an independent prognostic indicator.\n\nWhile we did not compare our method directly to other publicly available methods, the superior performance of our model against these established prognostic factors suggests its robustness and potential utility in clinical settings. The use of machine learning methods to identify hub genes and their expression profiles further supports the effectiveness of our approach in distinguishing between neuroblastoma samples and normal samples.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the model's performance includes several key metrics and statistical analyses that provide confidence in the results. The hazard ratios for various factors are presented with confidence intervals, indicating the range within which the true hazard ratio is likely to fall. For instance, the hazard ratio for the risk score in univariate analysis is 1.515 with a 95% confidence interval of 1.331 to 1.725, and in multivariate analysis, it is 1.632 with a 95% confidence interval of 1.391 to 1.934. These intervals provide a measure of the precision of the hazard ratio estimates.\n\nThe p-values associated with these hazard ratios are all less than 0.001, indicating that the results are statistically significant. This means that there is a very low probability that the observed associations are due to chance, strengthening the confidence in the model's prognostic value.\n\nAdditionally, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) value for the model's predictive performance is reported as greater than 0.8, which is considered excellent. This metric, along with the ROC curve, demonstrates that the model's prognostic value is superior to other clinical factors such as gender, age, INSS Stage, MYCN status, ploidy, histology, grade, MKI, and COG.\n\nThe Kaplan-Meier survival curves for different hub genes (CKB, DST, and DUT) also show significant differences between high-risk and low-risk groups, with p-values indicating statistical significance. These curves further validate the model's ability to distinguish between different risk levels and predict survival outcomes.\n\nOverall, the inclusion of confidence intervals, statistically significant p-values, and robust performance metrics such as the AUC value and ROC curves provide a high level of confidence in the model's performance and its superiority over other prognostic factors.",
  "evaluation/availability": "The raw data used for the evaluation of the prognostic model in this study were obtained from the TARGET database. This database contains expression values of 20,098 genes from 147 patients with neuroblastoma. The data underwent preprocessing steps, including background correction and normalization using R. Gene annotations were performed to match probes and gene symbols, and probes that matched multiple genes were removed. For genes matched by multiple probes, the median expression value was considered the final expression value.\n\nThe validation of the hub genes was conducted using the GEO database, specifically the GSE85047 dataset, which is publicly accessible. This dataset facilitated the discovery and identification of genome-wide expression analyses. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival differences between low-risk and high-risk groups, and the results were validated within this publicly available dataset.\n\nThe study also utilized the INRG classification system, which includes factors such as INSS Stage, MYCN status, Ploidy, Histology, Grade, MKI, and COG. These factors were considered in the evaluation of the model's predictive power. The AUC value, which indicates the model's predictive effectiveness, was found to be greater than 0.8, suggesting an excellent prediction result. This value was compared to the INRG classification system, demonstrating that the model performs better than traditional prognostic factors.\n\nThe nomogram developed in this study can predict the prognosis probability in neuroblastoma. It integrates various risk factors, including age and risk score, to provide a comprehensive assessment of patient outcomes. The nomogram's effectiveness was evaluated using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, which confirmed the risk score as an independent prognostic indicator.\n\nIn summary, the raw evaluation files are not directly available for public release due to the nature of the data and ethical considerations. However, the methods and datasets used for validation, such as the GEO database (GSE85047), are publicly accessible. The study's findings and the nomogram developed are intended to contribute to the field of neuroblastoma research and clinical practice, providing a more accurate and effective prognostic tool."
