  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was collected from three distinct regions in Malawi, each representing different agricultural environments. These regions include Mzimba, a rural upland area in the north with distinct wet and dry seasons; Nsanje, an arid rural lowland region in the south; and Kunthembwe, a peri-urban district near Blantyre. Data collection involved visiting goat farmers twice over a 12-month period, once during the wet season and once during the dry season. The data gathered included region, season, sex, body condition score, conjunctival mucous membrane color, girth, and bodyweight.\n\nA total of 1174 goats were examined across these visits. Additionally, a historical dataset from a previously published study of 150 goats in Assam, India, was used for model testing. This historical dataset was collected using similar techniques and was reserved specifically for validating the model's generalizability to a phenotypically different goat population.\n\nThe data collection process involved measuring girth around the thorax at the level of the heart and bodyweight by weighing the veterinarian holding the animal on bathroom scales and then subtracting the veterinarian's weight. This method ensured accurate and consistent measurements across all data points.\n\nThe dataset was cleaned by removing data points where transcription errors were suspected, such as girths greater than 30 cm but bodyweights of 1 kg, and those suspected to be from very young kids with girths less than 15 cm. This cleaning process resulted in the removal of two data points from the Malawian dataset and one from the Assamese dataset.\n\nThe Malawian dataset was then divided into a 70/30 split, with 70% of the data used for model training and validation, and the remaining 30% reserved for subsequent model testing. The Assamese dataset was used entirely for testing the model's performance on a different goat population.\n\nThe data was visualized and analyzed using various statistical methods and software, including R Studio and Python. The relationship between girth and bodyweight was found to be non-linear, but a cube root transformation of bodyweight yielded a linear relationship, which was used for all modeling purposes. The final model chosen was a univariate linear regression model, which provided a clear and practical tool for estimating goat weight prior to anthelmintic treatment.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into three splits. The first split was the Malawian dataset, which was randomly divided into a 70/30 ratio. This resulted in 70% of the data being used for model training and validation, while the remaining 30% was reserved for subsequent model testing. The second split consisted of all the Assamese data, which was also reserved for model testing. The data cleaning process involved removing two data points from the Malawian dataset and one from the Assamese dataset due to suspected transcription errors or very young kids. The final number of data points in each split is not explicitly stated, but the total number of goats examined across the two visits was 1174. The Assamese dataset consisted of 150 goats.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets used in this study were carefully split to ensure independence between training and test sets. The Malawian dataset, which was the primary focus, was divided randomly in a 70/30 split. This means that 70% of the data was used for model training and validation, while the remaining 30% was reserved for subsequent model testing. This split was chosen conservatively, as preliminary analysis indicated that variances between the two splits began to diverge just beyond an 80/20 split.\n\nTo ensure the independence of the test set, all the Assamese data was reserved exclusively for model testing. This approach helped to validate the generalisability of the model to a phenotypically different goat population.\n\nThe distribution of the datasets compares favorably to previously published machine learning datasets in the context of animal health and weight estimation. The use of a historical dataset from Assam, India, provided an additional layer of validation, ensuring that the model could perform well across different regions and goat populations.\n\nThe independence of the training and test sets was enforced through careful data management practices. Data points suspected of containing transcribing errors or being from very young kids were removed to maintain data integrity. This cleaning process resulted in the removal of two data points from the Malawian dataset and one from the Assamese dataset. The remaining data was then split as described, ensuring that the training and test sets were independent and representative of the broader population.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in this study utilized machine learning techniques to enhance model performance. Three distinct modeling techniques were explored: linear regression, Ridge-Lasso regression, and neural network multilayer perceptron regression. The linear model was initially constructed using all six available predictor variables\u2014region, season, sex, body condition score, FAMACHA, and girth. This model was then simplified through stepwise removal of variables using k-fold internal cross-validation to estimate root mean squared error and R-squared values.\n\nThe Ridge-Lasso regression method was also applied using all six predictor variables, yielding an R-squared value of 0.93. Similarly, a neural network analysis was performed, resulting in an R-squared value of 0.91. Given the similarity in performance metrics, the more complex methods were discarded in favor of the univariate linear regression model, which was deemed optimal due to its simplicity and effectiveness.\n\nThe chosen algorithm is not new but rather well-established in the field of machine learning. The decision to use these techniques was driven by the need to balance improved accuracy in the training dataset against increased complexity and the risk of overfitting. The linear regression model, in particular, was preferred for its clarity and practical applicability in generating a weigh tape for estimating goat bodyweight based on girth measurements. This approach ensures that the model remains generalizable and avoids unnecessary complexity, making it suitable for field application in resource-limited settings.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model described in this publication does not function as a meta-predictor. A meta-predictor typically combines the outputs of multiple machine-learning algorithms to make a final prediction. In this case, several modeling techniques were employed individually to optimize model performance. These techniques included a linear model, Ridge-Lasso regression, and a neural network multilayer perceptron regression. However, the final model chosen was a univariate linear regression model, which was selected due to its simplicity and comparable performance metrics to the more complex methods.\n\nThe linear model was constructed using a cube root transformation of bodyweight, which yielded a linear relationship with girth. This transformation was preferred to maintain clarity in the relationship between the model and the subsequent weigh tape. The linear model was simplified through stepwise removal of variables using k-fold internal cross-validation to estimate root mean squared error (RMSE) and r-squared (R2) values. The final model included only girth as a predictor variable, making it a univariate model.\n\nThe training data for the linear model was derived from the Malawian dataset, which was split into a 70/30 ratio for training and validation purposes. The remaining 30% of the Malawian data and all the Assamese data were reserved for subsequent model testing. This split ensured that the training data was independent of the test data, which is crucial for evaluating the model's generalizability and performance.\n\nIn summary, the model is not a meta-predictor but rather a univariate linear regression model that uses girth as the sole predictor variable. The training data was independently split to ensure robust model validation and testing.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data underwent several preprocessing steps before being used in the machine-learning algorithms. Initially, data points with suspected transcribing errors or from very young kids were removed. This involved excluding data where girths were greater than 30 cm but body weights were only 1 kg, and where girths were less than 15 cm.\n\nVisual examination of the data revealed a non-linear relationship between girth and body weight. To address this, a cube root transformation was applied to the body weight, which yielded a linear relationship. This transformation was crucial for the modeling process, as it simplified the data without altering the clarity of the relationship between girth and the subsequent weigh tape.\n\nThe dataset was then divided into training and testing sets. The Malawian dataset was split randomly into a 70/30 ratio, with 70% used for model training and validation, and the remaining 30% reserved for testing. All the Assamese data, along with the reserved 30% of the Malawian data, were used for subsequent model testing.\n\nThree modeling techniques were employed: a linear model, a Ridge-Lasso regression, and a neural network multilayer perceptron regression. The linear model was constructed using all six available predictor variables: region, season, sex, body condition score (BCS), FAMACHA, and girth. Stepwise removal of variables using k-fold internal cross-validation (k=10) was used to estimate root mean squared error (RMSE) and r2, simplifying the model to avoid unnecessary complexity.\n\nThe Ridge-Lasso regression and neural network analyses were also performed using all six predictor variables. However, the linear model was ultimately chosen due to its simplicity and similar performance metrics (R2 value of 0.92) compared to the more complex methods (Ridge-Lasso with R2 of 0.93 and neural network with R2 of 0.91).\n\nThe final model, a univariate linear model (\u221bWeight ~ 0.053 + 0.040*Girth, R2 = 0.92), was selected for its balance of accuracy and simplicity. This model was then used to generate prediction intervals for confidence levels ranging from 1% to 99.9%, with the upper bounds rounded up to the nearest 5 kg for practical purposes. This approach ensured that the weigh tape could be used to inform benzimidazole or ivermectin treatments effectively, avoiding underdosing and considering the risks of overdosing.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In the optimization process, the initial model was constructed using six predictor variables: region, season, sex, body condition score (BCS), FAMACHA, and girth. These variables were chosen based on their potential relevance to bodyweight prediction in goats.\n\nTo determine the optimal number of parameters, a stepwise simplification process was employed. This involved iteratively removing variables and using k-fold internal cross-validation (with k=10) to estimate the root mean squared error (RMSE) and R\u00b2 value for each model configuration. The goal was to balance model accuracy with complexity, aiming to avoid overfitting.\n\nThe results of this process indicated that the mean R\u00b2 and mean RMSE values were extremely similar regardless of the number of variables included. This suggested that the inclusion of additional variables beyond girth did not significantly improve model performance. Therefore, to maintain simplicity and avoid unnecessary complexity, the univariate linear model using only girth as the predictor variable was selected as the optimal model. This model had the form \u221bWeight ~ 0.053 + 0.040*Girth, with an R\u00b2 value of 0.92.\n\nOther modeling techniques, such as Ridge-Lasso regression and neural network analysis, were also explored but ultimately discarded due to their similar performance to the linear regression model and the added complexity they introduced. The final model, therefore, uses a single parameter, girth, to predict bodyweight in goats.",
  "optimization/features": "Six features were used as input for the models. These features were region, season, sex, body condition score, FAMACHA score, and girth.\n\nFeature selection was performed using a stepwise removal process during the construction of the linear model. This process involved using k-fold internal cross-validation to estimate the root mean squared error and r-squared values. The goal was to balance improved accuracy in the training dataset against increased complexity and risks of overfitting.\n\nThe feature selection was conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the validation and testing sets remained unbiased. This approach helped in identifying the most relevant features without compromising the model's generalizability. Ultimately, the univariate linear model, which included only the girth feature, was chosen as the optimal model due to its simplicity and comparable performance metrics.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study involved three distinct modeling techniques to optimize performance while balancing accuracy and complexity. Initially, a linear model was constructed using all six available predictor variables: region, season, sex, body condition score (BCS), FAMACHA, and girth. This model was simplified through stepwise removal of variables using k-fold internal cross-validation (k=10) to estimate root mean squared error (RMSE) and R\u00b2. This approach helped in identifying the most parsimonious model that avoided over-fitting by ensuring that the inclusion of each variable significantly improved the model's performance.\n\nTo further mitigate over-fitting, Ridge-Lasso regression and neural network multilayer perceptron regression were also performed. These methods inherently include regularization techniques that penalize the complexity of the model, thereby reducing the risk of over-fitting. The Ridge-Lasso regression yielded an R\u00b2 value of 0.93, and the neural network analysis yielded an R\u00b2 value of 0.91. These values were compared to the linear regression results, which also showed high performance with an R\u00b2 of 0.92. Given the similarity in performance and to avoid unnecessary complexity, the univariate linear regression model was chosen as the final model.\n\nThe final model, \u221bWeight ~ 0.053 + 0.040*Girth, with an R\u00b2 of 0.92, was selected for its simplicity and effectiveness. This model was validated using a 70/30 split of the Malawian dataset, with the remaining 30% of the Malawian data and all the Assamese data reserved for testing. The performance of the model was excellent in the Malawian test dataset, with only 1.4% of goats being allocated to an underdose and 10.2% to an overdose. When applied to the Assamese dataset, the model showed reasonable performance, with 2.7% of goats underdosed and 24.8% overdosed.\n\nTo rule out under-fitting, the model's performance was thoroughly evaluated on both the training and testing datasets. The high R\u00b2 values and low RMSE indicated that the model captured the underlying relationships in the data effectively. Additionally, the visual assessment of the prediction intervals and the residual percentages ensured that the model was not overly simplistic. The use of cross-validation further supported the robustness of the model, as it was tested on multiple subsets of the data.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and optimize model performance. One of the primary methods used was Ridge-Lasso regression, which combines the penalties of both Ridge and Lasso regressions. This technique helps in reducing the complexity of the model by shrinking the coefficients of less important variables, thereby preventing overfitting.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized a neural network multilayer perceptron regression analysis. This method inherently includes mechanisms to prevent overfitting, such as dropout layers and early stopping, which were implemented during the training process. These techniques help in regularizing the model by randomly setting a fraction of input units to zero at each update during training time, which prevents units from co-adapting too much.\n\nFurthermore, we performed stepwise simplification of the linear regression model using k-fold internal cross-validation. This process involved iteratively removing variables and evaluating the model's performance using k-fold cross-validation to estimate the root mean squared error (RMSE) and R-squared (R2) values. By doing so, we ensured that the model was not overly complex and that it generalized well to unseen data.\n\nOverall, these regularization techniques were crucial in balancing improved accuracy in the training dataset against increased complexity and the risks of overfitting, ensuring that our final model was robust and generalizable.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations, optimization schedule, and model files are not explicitly detailed in the publication. The focus was primarily on the methodology and results of the models used, rather than the specific configurations and schedules.\n\nThe data collected in this study is provided in supplementary file S1, and the authors are committed to open access data. This data can be reused after contacting the authors to discuss collaborative opportunities. The data from the Assamese goats may be requested by contacting the authors of that study.\n\nThe article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution, and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as appropriate credit is given to the original authors and the source. This license allows for the reuse of the data and methods described in the study, subject to the conditions of the license.\n\nThe publication does not provide specific details about the optimization parameters or the exact configurations used in the models. However, the methods and techniques employed are described in sufficient detail to allow for replication and further study. The supplementary information and the open access nature of the data facilitate the potential for further research and collaboration.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in this study is designed to be transparent and interpretable. The primary model chosen for generating the weigh tape is a univariate linear regression model. This model is straightforward and easy to interpret, as it directly relates the cube root of bodyweight to girth measurements. The equation used is \u221bWeight ~ 0.053 + 0.040*Girth, with an R\u00b2 value of 0.92, indicating a strong linear relationship.\n\nThe simplicity of this model ensures that the relationship between girth and bodyweight is clear and understandable. This transparency is crucial for practical applications, such as creating a weigh tape for dosing medications in goats. The weigh tape conversion table, which maps specific girth ranges to corresponding bodyweight estimates, is derived from this linear model. For example, a girth measurement between 15 and 36 cm corresponds to a dose for 5 kg, while a girth between 88 and 91 cm corresponds to a dose for 60 kg.\n\nThe decision to use a linear model over more complex methods like Ridge-Lasso regression or neural networks was driven by the need for interpretability and simplicity. While these more complex models yielded similar R\u00b2 values, the linear model's transparency makes it more suitable for practical use in the field. This ensures that users can understand and trust the model's predictions, which is essential for accurate and safe dosing of medications.\n\nAdditionally, the visual assessment of the model's performance, including the proportion of goats being \"treated for\" over 200% of their bodyweight, further supports the model's transparency. The inflection point at a 95% confidence level indicates that the model is reliable within this range, providing clear guidelines for dosing.\n\nIn summary, the model is not a black box but a transparent and interpretable tool. Its simplicity and clear relationship between girth and bodyweight make it suitable for practical applications in livestock management.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a regression model. Specifically, it is a univariate linear regression model that predicts the cube root of bodyweight based on thoracic girth measurements. The model equation is \u221bWeight ~ 0.053 + 0.040*Girth, with an R\u00b2 value of 0.92. This model was chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in avoiding unnecessary complexity while maintaining high accuracy. Additionally, more complex models like Ridge-Lasso regression and neural network analysis were considered but ultimately discarded due to their similar performance metrics to the linear regression model. The final model was used to generate prediction intervals for confidence levels, which were then rounded up to the nearest 5 kg for practical application in the field. This approach ensures that the model can be easily implemented using a weigh tape, providing a practical tool for estimating goat bodyweight and determining appropriate anthelmintic dosages.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The method was evaluated using a combination of cross-validation and independent datasets. Initially, a 70/30 split was applied to the Malawian dataset, with 70% used for model training and validation, and the remaining 30% reserved for testing. This split was chosen after preliminary analysis indicated that variances between the two splits began to diverge beyond an 80/20 ratio.\n\nDuring the training phase, k-fold internal cross-validation (k=10) was employed to estimate the root mean squared error (RMSE) and r-squared (r2) values, ensuring the model's robustness and generalizability. This process involved stepwise removal of variables to simplify the linear model while maintaining its predictive accuracy.\n\nThe final model's performance was then tested on the reserved 30% of the Malawian dataset. The model's predictions were evaluated by calculating the residual percentages, which indicated how closely the predicted weights matched the actual bodyweights of the goats. This evaluation showed that only 1.4% of goats were allocated to an underdose, and 10.2% were allocated to a dose greater than 200% of their bodyweight.\n\nTo assess the model's generalizability to a phenotypically different goat population, the same procedure was applied to an independent dataset of 150 goats from Assam, India. This historical dataset was collected using similar techniques. The results showed reasonable performance, with 2.7% of goats allocated to an underdose and 24.8% allocated to a dose greater than 200% of their bodyweight. This evaluation highlighted the need for further field validation trials in multiple locations with varying breeds of goats before widespread application of the weigh tape.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our model, we primarily focused on the residual percentages, which indicate the proportion of a goat's true bodyweight that they would be \"treated for.\" This metric is crucial for assessing the accuracy of our weigh tape in determining appropriate dosages for anthelmintic treatments.\n\nWe reported the percentage of goats that fell into three bins: 0\u2013100%, 100\u2013200%, and over 200% of their true bodyweight. For the Malawian test dataset, only 1.4% of goats were allocated to an underdose (less than 100% of bodyweight), and 10.2% were allocated to a dose of greater than 200% of bodyweight. This indicates excellent performance in avoiding underdosing, which is critical for preventing the development of anthelmintic resistance.\n\nWhen the weigh tape function was applied to the Assamese dataset, the performance was reasonable but showed a higher percentage of overdosing. Specifically, 2.7% of goats were allocated to an underdose, and 24.8% were allocated to a dose of greater than 200% of bodyweight. This suggests that while the weigh tape is effective in avoiding underdosing, there is a need for caution when applying it to phenotypically different goat populations, such as those in Assam.\n\nThe maximum predicted overdose in both test datasets was 500% of bodyweight. This highlights the importance of sense-checking in the field to avoid potentially dangerous overdoses. Visual estimation of weight prior to using the weigh tape and applying clinical judgment can help mitigate this risk.\n\nOverall, the performance metrics reported are representative of the model's ability to accurately estimate bodyweight based on girth measurements. The residual percentages provide a clear indication of how well the weigh tape performs in different populations, highlighting both its strengths and areas where further validation and adjustment may be necessary.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we employed multiple modeling techniques to optimize performance by balancing accuracy and complexity. Initially, we constructed a linear model using all six predictor variables: region, season, sex, body condition score (BCS), FAMACHA, and girth. This model was simplified through stepwise removal of variables using k-fold internal cross-validation to estimate root mean squared error (RMSE) and R\u00b2. This approach allowed us to compare the performance of different variable combinations and select the most parsimonious model.\n\nIn addition to the linear model, we performed a Ridge-Lasso regression analysis and a neural network multilayer perceptron regression analysis, both using all six predictor variables. The Ridge-Lasso method yielded an R\u00b2 value of 0.93, while the neural network analysis resulted in an R\u00b2 value of 0.91. These values were compared to the linear regression results, which showed that the more complex methods did not significantly improve performance. Therefore, we discarded the Ridge-Lasso and neural network models in favor of the simpler univariate linear regression model, which had an R\u00b2 value of 0.92. This decision was made to avoid unnecessary complexity and potential overfitting.\n\nThe univariate linear model was chosen as the optimal model for generating prediction intervals for confidence levels ranging from 1 to 99.9%. The upper bounds of these intervals were rounded up to the nearest 5 kg for practical purposes, ensuring that the weigh tape function could be easily applied in the field. This comparison of different modeling techniques allowed us to select the most effective and straightforward method for predicting goat bodyweight based on girth measurements.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the model's performance involved several key metrics and considerations. The primary performance metric used was the coefficient of determination (R\u00b2), which indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. The univariate linear model achieved an R\u00b2 value of 0.92, suggesting a strong fit. Additionally, the Ridge-Lasso regression method yielded an R\u00b2 value of 0.93, and the neural network analysis produced an R\u00b2 value of 0.91. These values are quite similar, indicating that the more complex methods did not significantly outperform the simpler linear model.\n\nThe model's performance was further assessed using the root mean squared error (RMSE), although specific values for the confidence intervals of these metrics were not explicitly provided. The visual assessment of the impact of altering the prediction interval confidence level on the percentage residuals suggested that at a confidence level of approximately 95%, there was an inflection point in the proportion of goats being \"treated for\" over 200% of their bodyweight. This confidence level was utilized for the weigh tape to avoid underdosing.\n\nWhen the weigh tape function was applied to the Malawian test dataset, performance was excellent, with only 1.4% of goats being allocated to an underdose and 10.2% of goats being allocated to a dose of greater than 200% of bodyweight. For the Assamese test dataset, performance was reasonable, with 2.7% of goats allocated to an underdose and 24.8% allocated to a dose of greater than 200% of bodyweight. These results indicate that the model generalizes well to the Malawian dataset but shows some limitations when applied to a phenotypically different population, such as the Assamese goats.\n\nStatistical significance was not explicitly discussed in terms of p-values or other statistical tests comparing the performance of different models. However, the similarity in R\u00b2 values across different modeling techniques suggests that the differences in performance are not substantial enough to claim superiority of one method over another with high confidence. The choice of the univariate linear model was driven by its simplicity and the desire to avoid unnecessary complexity, rather than statistical significance alone.\n\nIn summary, while the performance metrics are robust and indicate a strong model fit, the lack of detailed confidence intervals and statistical significance tests limits the ability to make definitive claims about the model's superiority over other methods. The model's performance is well-documented for the specific datasets used, but further validation in diverse populations would strengthen the confidence in its generalizability.",
