  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our work utilizes machine-learning techniques to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of subcortical ischemic vascular disease of the Binswanger type (SIVD-BD). Specifically, we have used the Random Forests algorithm, which is a well-established ensemble learning method known for its robustness and ability to handle complex datasets.\n\nThe Random Forests algorithm is not new; it has been extensively used in various fields, including medicine, for its capability to provide accurate predictions and handle large datasets with multiple features. The choice of Random Forests was driven by its proven effectiveness in similar diagnostic tasks and its ability to manage the intricacies of our dataset, which includes a variety of biomarkers and clinical features.\n\nGiven that Random Forests is a widely recognized and validated algorithm, it was deemed appropriate to present our findings in a neurology-focused journal rather than a machine-learning journal. The primary focus of our research is on the application of these techniques to improve the diagnosis and understanding of SIVD-BD, rather than the development of new machine-learning algorithms. This approach aligns with our goal of advancing the field of neurology through the integration of advanced computational methods.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employs a meta-predictor approach, integrating outputs from multiple machine-learning algorithms to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Specifically, both logistic regression and the Random Forests algorithm are utilized. These methods are trained on an expanded set of biomarkers derived from a larger cohort of patients, which helps in accurately determining the probability of a diagnosis of SIVD-BD compared to other diagnoses.\n\nThe use of multiple algorithms allows for a more robust and precise diagnostic tool, as it leverages the strengths of different machine-learning techniques. The training data for these algorithms is derived from expert opinions and an enlarged set of biomarkers, ensuring that the data is independent and diverse. This independence is crucial for the model's reliability and generalizability.\n\nAs more patients are entered into the system and followed up over time, the training set continues to grow, further improving the diagnostic accuracy. This ongoing process ensures that the model remains up-to-date and effective in predicting diagnoses, even for overlapping diseases. The integration of these machine-learning methods into a meta-predictor framework is a significant step towards achieving precision diagnosis in the field of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia.",

  "optimization/parameters": "In the optimization process, the model utilizes a set of input parameters derived from various clinical features, neuropsychological tests, metabolites in white matter, inflammation and blood-brain barrier markers, and Alzheimer\u2019s biomarkers. The total number of parameters, p, is 13. These parameters were selected based on their relevance to the diagnosis of Binswanger Disease (BD) and their ability to distinguish BD from other forms of vascular cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. The selection process involved expert opinions and statistical methods, including Principal Component Analysis and Exploratory Factor Analysis, to ensure that the most significant features were included. The parameters cover a range of biological and clinical indicators, providing a comprehensive approach to diagnosing BD.",
  "optimization/features": "The input features used in the scoring system to select patients most likely to have SIVD-BD consist of 13 distinct features. These features are categorized into five groups: clinical features, neuropsychological testing, metabolites in white matter, inflammation and blood-brain barrier (BBB) markers, and Alzheimer\u2019s biomarkers.\n\nThe clinical features include hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyper-reflexia, and imbalance. Neuropsychological testing focuses on executive function scores. Metabolites in white matter involve measurements of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and choline (CHO). Inflammation and BBB markers include the albumin index, BBB permeability, and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) index. Alzheimer\u2019s biomarkers consider the ratio of amyloid-\u03b21\u201342 to phosphorylated-\u03c4181.\n\nFeature selection was performed to identify the major features involved in the diagnosis. This selection process was based on expert opinions and literature reviews, ensuring that the features used are relevant and significant for diagnosing SIVD-BD. The feature selection was conducted using the training set only, adhering to best practices in machine learning to prevent data leakage and ensure the model's generalizability.",

  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in our study is not a black box but rather a transparent system, particularly when utilizing machine-learning algorithms like Random Forests. These algorithms are inherently interpretable, as they provide insights into the importance of various features used in the classification process. For instance, Random Forests can rank features based on their contribution to the predictive accuracy of the model. This ranking helps identify which biomarkers are most critical in determining the probability of a diagnosis.\n\nIn our heuristic method of classification, we constructed a scoring system known as the Binswanger Disease Score System (BDSS). This system includes various features such as structural damage to the white matter, indicated by a low N-acetylaspartate (NAA) level, and inflammatory factors like a reduced matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) index. Higher scores in the BDSS indicate a higher probability of the patient having SIVD-BD. This scoring system is transparent because it clearly outlines the components and their respective weights, making it easy to understand how the diagnosis is reached.\n\nAdditionally, our use of statistical methods like logistic regression further enhances the transparency of the model. Logistic regression provides coefficients for each feature, indicating their individual impact on the likelihood of the diagnosis. This allows for a clear interpretation of how each biomarker contributes to the final prediction.\n\nOverall, the combination of these methods ensures that our model is not only accurate but also interpretable, providing valuable insights into the diagnostic process.",
  "model/output": "The model discussed in this publication is primarily focused on classification rather than regression. It aims to determine the probability of a diagnosis of subcortical ischemic vascular disease of the Binswanger type (SIVD-BD) rather than predicting a continuous outcome. The model utilizes machine-learning algorithms, specifically Random Forests, along with logistic regression, to classify patients based on a set of biomarkers and features. These features include clinical indicators, neuropsychological test results, metabolites in white matter, inflammation markers, and blood-brain barrier permeability. The goal is to accurately distinguish SIVD-BD from other diagnoses, leveraging the increasing number of features and an expanding training set based on expert opinions. This approach allows for a more precise diagnosis, potentially years before clinicians can differentiate overlapping diseases.",

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the classification methods involved multiple approaches to ensure their accuracy and reliability. Initially, a heuristic method was developed based on literature reports, which included various features used in diagnosing the condition. This method was refined into a scoring system, the Binswanger Disease Score System (BDSS), where higher scores indicated a higher probability of the patient having the condition. The major components of this system included structural damage to the white matter, indicated by a low N-acetylaspartate (NAA) level, and inflammatory factors such as a reduced matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) index.\n\nTo further enhance the diagnostic accuracy, statistical methods were employed. Both logistic regression and the machine-learning algorithm, Random Forests, were used with an enlarged set of biomarkers derived from an expanded cohort of patients. These methods demonstrated accurate determination of the condition compared to other diagnoses. This encouraging result suggests the potential to predict a diagnosis several years before clinicians can separate overlapping diseases.\n\nAs more patients are entered into the system and sufficient follow-up time is available, the training set will expand, improving diagnostic accuracy. The evaluation also considered the future directions, acknowledging the projected increase in patients with vascular causes of dementia and the need for biomarkers linked to inflammation. The biomarkers selected reflect current concepts of tissue injury mechanisms, involving long-standing vascular injury, reduced cerebral blood flow, intermittent hypoxia, and inflammation response. This approach guides the selection of the optimal set of biomarkers conforming to the proposed pathophysiology.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our methods for diagnosing subcortical ischemic vascular disease of the Binswanger type (SIVD-BD), we employed a combination of traditional statistical methods and advanced machine-learning algorithms. Specifically, we utilized logistic regression and the Random Forests algorithm to determine the probability of a diagnosis of SIVD-BD. These methods were applied to an expanded set of biomarkers derived from a cohort of patients, allowing for an accurate determination of SIVD-BD compared to other diagnoses.\n\nThe performance metrics reported in our study include the accuracy of the diagnostic predictions made by these algorithms. We found that both logistic regression and Random Forests provided accurate determinations of SIVD-BD, suggesting that these methods are effective in distinguishing SIVD-BD from other overlapping diseases. This accuracy is particularly encouraging as it indicates the potential for early diagnosis, several years prior to the clinicians\u2019 ability to separate these conditions.\n\nThe set of metrics used in our study is representative of current practices in the field, as similar statistical and machine-learning approaches have been successfully applied in other medical domains for precision diagnosis. The use of multiple biomarkers and advanced analytical techniques aligns with the growing trend in medical research towards more precise and individualized diagnostic methods. By continuously expanding our training set with more patients and longer follow-up periods, we aim to further improve the diagnostic accuracy and reliability of our methods.",

  "evaluation/confidence": "Evaluation Confidence\n\nThe evaluation of the methods discussed involves several key biomarkers and statistical analyses that provide a robust foundation for confidence in the results. The albumin index, which indicates blood-brain barrier disruption, shows significant elevation in patients with Binswanger\u2019s disease (BD), suggesting a clear and measurable difference. Similarly, the N-acetylaspartate (NAA) levels in white matter, measured by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, are significantly lower in BD patients due to ischemic injury, providing another reliable biomarker. The matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) index is also significantly reduced in BD, further supporting the diagnostic value of these biomarkers.\n\nStatistical significance is a crucial aspect of the evaluation. The numbers in parentheses in the figures represent the statistical significance of the findings, ensuring that the observed differences are not due to random chance. This rigorous statistical approach enhances the confidence in the results and the superiority of the methods used.\n\nMoreover, the use of machine-learning algorithms, such as Random Forests, in conjunction with logistic regression, has shown accurate determination of SIVD-BD compared to other diagnoses. This combination of traditional statistical methods and advanced machine-learning techniques provides a comprehensive and reliable evaluation framework. The increasing number of patients and the growing training set based on expert opinions further improve the diagnostic accuracy, making the results more confident and reliable over time.",
