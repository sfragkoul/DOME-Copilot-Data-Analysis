  "dataset/provenance": "The datasets used in this study were obtained from various sources to train and validate machine learning-based gene signatures for drug responses. For cell-line datasets, microarray gene expression (GE) data and growth inhibition data (GI50 or IC50) were used from breast cancer cell lines treated with cisplatin (N = 39), carboplatin (N = 46), or oxaliplatin (N = 47). Additionally, bladder cancer cell line GE and IC50 measurements for cisplatin were obtained from CancerRxGene (N = 17). However, all models used to evaluate patient data were trained on breast cancer cell line data due to the insufficient number of bladder cancer cell lines.\n\nFor patient datasets, RNA-seq GE and survival measurements were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for patients with bladder urothelial carcinoma (N = 72 treated with cisplatin), ovarian epithelial tumors (N = 410 treated with carboplatin), and colorectal adenocarcinoma (N = 99 treated with oxaliplatin). Additional GE values for cisplatin-treated patients with urothelial carcinoma (N = 30) and oxaliplatin-treated patients with colorectal cancer (N = 83) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus. Clinical metadata and GE for TCGA patients were sourced from the Genomic Data Commons, while methylation data were downloaded from cBioPortal.\n\nThe initial gene sets for developing signatures were identified from previous publications and databases such as PharmGKB and DrugBank. These gene sets were refined using Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA) with breast cancer cell line data to analyze interactions between GE, copy number (CN), and GI50 data. Genes whose expression and/or CN showed a correlation with GI50 were selected for Support Vector Machine (SVM) training. For cisplatin, genes with low expression in TCGA bladder cancer patients were eliminated to avoid data-to-sample size imbalance. The methodology and datasets used are adaptable to other drugs and cancer types, aiming to improve treatment efficacy by tailoring it to a patient's specific tumor biology.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in this study is Support Vector Machines (SVMs). SVMs are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression, and outliers detection. They are particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces and are robust to overfitting.\n\nThe specific SVM implementation employed in this research is not entirely novel but involves a unique application and optimization process tailored to the problem at hand. The approach includes the use of a Gaussian kernel function, which is a common choice for SVM due to its ability to handle non-linear relationships. The models were trained using a method similar to that reported by Dorman et al., but with modifications to enhance classification accuracy.\n\nA greedy Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm was utilized to improve the classification accuracy of the SVM models. This algorithm systematically evaluates and removes genes from the initial set based on their misclassification rates, aiming to identify the gene subset that yields the lowest misclassification rate or log-loss statistic. This process ensures that the final gene signature is optimized for predictive performance.\n\nThe reason this specific SVM implementation was not published in a machine-learning journal is that the focus of this study is on the application of machine learning to predict chemotherapy responses rather than the development of new machine-learning algorithms. The primary contribution lies in the biological insights gained from the gene signatures and their potential clinical applications. The optimization of the SVM models is a means to achieve this end, rather than the end itself.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employs an ensemble approach, which can be considered a form of meta-predictor, as it integrates multiple machine-learning algorithms to improve predictive accuracy. Specifically, ensemble machine learning (ML) is used to combine gene signatures generated at different resistance thresholds. This method helps to mitigate issues related to poor performance and overfitting by leveraging the strengths of multiple individual gene signatures.\n\nThe ensemble model incorporates various machine-learning techniques, including support vector machine (SVM) models, which are used to derive gene sets whose expression is related to cell line GI50 values. These SVM models are trained using data from cancer cell lines and validated with patient gene expression and clinical outcome data. The ensemble approach involves averaging the predictions from these SVM models, which are generated at different GI50 thresholds. This averaging process helps to reduce the dependence on specific GI50 values for predicting drug responses.\n\nIt is important to note that the training data for the ensemble model is derived from cancer cell lines, and these models are then validated using independent patient data. This ensures that the training data is independent of the validation data, which is crucial for assessing the generalizability and robustness of the model. The ensemble approach aims to provide a more accurate and reliable prediction of drug responses by combining the predictions from multiple models, each trained on different resistance thresholds.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure the data was suitable for training and testing the models. Initially, gene expression (GE) data from breast cancer cell lines treated with cisplatin, carboplatin, or oxaliplatin were used. These datasets included growth inhibition (GI50) or target inhibition (IC50) data, which were crucial for training the machine-learning models.\n\nTo handle the differences in data types and sources, expression levels were normalized by converting them to z-scores using MATLAB. This normalization step was essential because the training data came from microarray platforms, while the testing data were RNA-seq datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients. This approach helped to mitigate the discrepancies arising from different methodologies.\n\nFor cisplatin, genes whose expression correlated with the GI50 values were selected, but those with minimal expression in TCGA bladder cancer patients (RNA-seq counts by Expectation Maximization [RSEM] <5.0 for the majority of individuals) were eliminated. This filtering step reduced the number of genes for the support vector machine (SVM) analysis, helping to avoid data-to-sample size imbalances.\n\nThe initial gene sets for each drug were identified from previous publications and databases such as PharmGKB and DrugBank. These genes were then analyzed using multiple factor analysis (MFA) with breast cancer cell line data to examine interactions between GE, copy number (CN), and GI50 data. Genes showing a direct or inverse correlation with GI50 were selected for SVM training.\n\nFor drugs like oxaliplatin, where the number of correlated genes exceeded the number of cell lines, the input for the machine-learning model was limited to genes whose GE was related to the GI50. This approach ensured that the model was not overfitted and could generalize better to new data.\n\nIn summary, the data encoding and preprocessing involved normalization to z-scores, filtering of genes based on expression levels in patient data, and selection of biologically relevant genes through MFA. These steps were crucial for training robust machine-learning models that could accurately predict chemotherapy responses in patients.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the number of parameters used in the model varied depending on the specific gene signature and the drug resistance threshold. We derived gene signatures for different levels of drug resistance by varying the GI50 threshold. This process generated a series of optimized Gaussian SVM gene signatures, each with a different set of genes.\n\nThe selection of genes for the final signatures was based on their biological relevance to the drugs under observation. We initially documented genes associated with drug effectiveness or responses from the peer-reviewed literature. For cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin, 179, 90, and 288 genes were implicated, respectively. However, not all of these genes were included in the final signatures. We reduced the number of dimensions by selecting genes that were biologically relevant and showed significant correlation with drug response.\n\nThe final gene signatures consisted of a subset of these genes, with the exact number varying by signature. For example, some cisplatin gene signatures included between 13 to 19 genes. The selection of these genes was done using a greedy BFS algorithm that evaluated each gene's contribution to the classification accuracy. Genes with the highest misclassification rate were removed iteratively until the subset with the lowest misclassification rate was identified.\n\nAdditionally, we used ensemble averaging to combine signatures by averaging the weighted accuracy of a set of related models. This approach helped to create a composite gene signature that performed well across different resistance thresholds. The decision function for the ensemble classifier was the mean of the decision function scores of the component classifiers, weighted by the AUC.\n\nIn summary, the number of parameters (p) in our model was not fixed but varied depending on the specific gene signature and the drug resistance threshold. The selection of genes was based on their biological relevance and their contribution to the classification accuracy, as determined by the greedy BFS algorithm and ensemble averaging.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, the number of input features varied depending on the drug and the specific analysis. For cisplatin, the number of correlated genes in treated cells exceeded the number of cell lines, so feature selection was crucial. Genes whose expression correlated with the GI50 were eliminated if they showed no or little expression in TCGA patients with bladder cancer. This approach reduced the overall number of genes for the SVM analysis, helping to avoid a data-to-size sample imbalance.\n\nFor oxaliplatin, the number of genes related to the GI50 also exceeded the number of cell lines available for training. Therefore, we limited the input for the oxaliplatin ML model to those genes whose gene expression was related to the GI50.\n\nFeature selection was performed using the training set only, ensuring that the model's generalizability was not compromised. We used multiple factor analysis (MFA) to analyze interactions between gene expression, copy number, and GI50 data for the drug of interest. Genes whose gene expression and/or copy number showed a direct or inverse correlation with GI50 were selected for SVM training.\n\nIn summary, feature selection was an essential step in our methodology to ensure that the models were trained on biologically relevant genes, reducing the risk of overfitting and improving the models' generalizability. The exact number of features used as input varied by drug and analysis but was determined through a rigorous feature selection process using the training set only.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we indeed encountered a scenario where the number of parameters (genes) was initially much larger than the number of training points (cell lines). This is a common issue in gene expression studies due to the high dimensionality of the data. To address potential overfitting, we employed several strategies.\n\nFirstly, we reduced the number of dimensions by selecting genes that were biologically relevant to the drugs under observation. This step was crucial in mitigating the risk of overfitting by focusing on genes with known roles in drug responses.\n\nSecondly, we used multiple factor analysis (MFA) to analyze interactions between gene expression, copy number variations, and drug response data (GI50 or IC50). This approach helped us to identify genes whose expression and/or copy number showed a direct or inverse correlation with drug response, further refining our gene set.\n\nFor cisplatin, we eliminated genes whose expression correlated with GI50 but showed no or little expression in TCGA patients with bladder cancer. This step helped to avoid a data-to-sample size imbalance and reduced the overall number of genes for the support vector machine (SVM) analysis.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized a greedy backward feature selection (BFS) algorithm to improve classification accuracy. This algorithm iteratively removes genes with the highest misclassification rate, ensuring that the final gene subset has the lowest misclassification rate or log-loss statistic based on cross-validation.\n\nTo further validate our models and rule out underfitting, we performed leave-one-out cross-validation and k-fold cross-validation. These techniques helped us to assess the generalizability of our models and ensure that they were not too simplistic to capture the underlying patterns in the data.\n\nMoreover, we created composite gene signatures through ensemble averaging, which combines signatures by averaging the weighted accuracy of related models. This approach helped to enhance the robustness and accuracy of our predictions.\n\nIn summary, by carefully selecting biologically relevant genes, using dimensionality reduction techniques, employing feature selection algorithms, and validating our models through cross-validation, we were able to mitigate the risks of both overfitting and underfitting in our study.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the generalizability of our models. One of the primary concerns with machine learning approaches in genomics is the risk of overfitting due to the high dimensionality of gene expression data relative to the number of samples. To mitigate this, we reduced the number of dimensions by selecting genes that are biologically relevant to the drugs under observation. This approach helped in focusing on features that are more likely to be informative and reducing the noise from irrelevant genes.\n\nAdditionally, we used a greedy Best-First Search (BFS) algorithm to improve classification accuracy. This algorithm iteratively removes genes with the highest misclassification rate from the initial gene set, thereby refining the model and reducing the risk of overfitting. The procedure was repeated until all genes were evaluated, and the gene subset with the lowest misclassification rate or log-loss statistic based on cross-validation was selected as the gene signature for subsequent testing.\n\nWe also performed k-fold cross-validation to assess the performance of our models. This technique involves dividing the data into k subsets, training the model on k-1 subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated k times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. Cross-validation helps in providing a more robust estimate of model performance and reduces the likelihood of overfitting.\n\nFurthermore, we conducted permutation analyses with randomized cell line labels and random sets of genes to assess the significance of our derived support vector machines (SVMs). This involved generating gene signatures based on random gene selection and comparing their performance to our biologically-inspired signatures. The results indicated that our signatures performed significantly better than those derived from random gene selection, further validating their robustness and generalizability.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations, optimization schedule, model files, and optimization parameters are not explicitly detailed in the provided information. However, it is mentioned that machine learning experiments were conducted using specific tools and methods, such as Gaussian kernel functions in MATLAB and leave-one-out cross-validation. The gene signatures derived from these experiments were assessed using patient expression data.\n\nThe specific configurations and parameters used in these experiments are not reported in the provided information. Therefore, it is not clear whether these details are available for public access or under what license they might be shared.\n\nThe gene signatures and the methods used to derive them are described, but the exact hyper-parameter settings and optimization details are not specified. This information would be necessary for replicating the experiments or understanding the optimization process in detail.",
  "model/interpretability": "The models employed in this study are not entirely black-box, as they utilize Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with a Gaussian kernel, which can be interpreted to some extent. The process of deriving gene signatures involves a greedy Best-First Search (BFS) algorithm that evaluates individual genes based on their misclassification rates, providing a level of transparency. This algorithm iteratively removes genes with the highest misclassification rates, ultimately selecting a gene subset with the lowest misclassification rate. This approach allows for the identification of specific genes that contribute significantly to the model's predictions.\n\nMoreover, the ensemble averaging technique used to create composite gene signatures combines multiple models, averaging their decision function scores weighted by the Area Under the Curve (AUC). This method enhances the interpretability of the results by highlighting the most consistent and reliable predictors across different resistance thresholds.\n\nAdditionally, the study explores the biological relevance of the selected genes by examining pathways related to chemoresistance. For instance, genes like MSH2, which is involved in mismatch repair, and BCL2, associated with apoptotic pathways, are frequently selected in the gene signatures. This biological context helps in understanding the underlying mechanisms of drug resistance and provides insights into potential targets for further study.\n\nThe heat map generated using the R language hist2d function visualizes the frequencies of genes appearing in the gene signatures at different resistance thresholds. This visualization tool aids in interpreting which genes are consistently important across various levels of drug resistance.\n\nFurthermore, the study discusses the impact of specific genes, such as ATP7B, which is present in multiple carboplatin models and significantly affects the accuracy of predictions for carboplatin-treated patients. This detailed analysis of individual genes and their contributions to the model's performance adds to the interpretability of the results.\n\nIn summary, while the models are based on complex machine learning techniques, the use of SVMs with a Gaussian kernel, the greedy BFS algorithm, ensemble averaging, and the exploration of biological pathways provide a level of transparency. This allows for a better understanding of the key genes and mechanisms involved in drug resistance, making the models more interpretable than typical black-box approaches.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in this study is primarily a classification model. It utilizes supervised support vector machine (SVM) learning to derive gene sets whose expression is related to the cell line GI50 values. The goal is to classify patients into categories such as disease-free or recurrent based on their gene expression profiles. The model generates gene signatures that predict responses to different platinum-based chemotherapy agents\u2014cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin. These signatures are then validated using clinical outcome data from patients with various types of cancer, such as bladder, ovarian, and colorectal cancer. The accuracy of the model is evaluated based on its ability to correctly classify patients into these categories, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting treatment responses.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "The source code for the machine learning models and algorithms used in this study is not publicly released. However, the results of these models, including the gene signatures, are made available through an online web-based SVM calculator. This calculator can be accessed at http://chemotherapy.cytognomix.com. The calculator allows users to input patient expression data and predict responses to platin chemotherapy agents, such as cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin. The web-based tool provides a user-friendly interface for applying the derived gene signatures to new datasets, facilitating the prediction of drug responses in clinical settings.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the method involved several rigorous steps to ensure the robustness and accuracy of the gene signatures derived from cell line data. Initially, permutation analysis was conducted using randomized cell line labels and random sets of genes to assess the significance of the derived Support Vector Machines (SVMs). This involved generating 10,000 gene signatures based on random gene selection and comparing their misclassification rates with the best-performing SVM gene signatures.\n\nFor cisplatin, the median GI50 was used as the resistance threshold, and the analysis showed that the best SVM gene signatures had lower misclassification rates compared to randomly selected gene signatures. Similar analyses were performed for carboplatin and oxaliplatin, with the results indicating that the biochemically-inspired signatures outperformed those generated with random cell line labels.\n\nAdditionally, log-loss minimization was employed to evaluate the gene signatures. The random gene analysis and random label analysis were conducted to compare the log-loss of the derived signatures with those generated using the initial cisplatin gene set. The findings indicated that the cisplatin gene signatures had lower log-loss, demonstrating their superior performance.\n\nThe specificity of the cisplatin gene signatures was further evaluated by applying them to patients treated with other drugs. The accuracy of the signatures in predicting disease-free and recurrent disease outcomes was assessed, showing that the cisplatin gene signatures performed better in modeling patients treated with platinum drugs compared to those treated with other drugs.\n\nK-fold cross-validation was also utilized to evaluate the misclassification-based gene signatures for cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin. This method involved dividing the data into k subsets, training the model on k-1 subsets, and testing it on the remaining subset. This process was repeated k times, with each subset serving as the test set once. The results of the cross-validation provided insights into the generalizability and robustness of the gene signatures.\n\nFurthermore, ensemble averaging was employed to create a composite gene signature by combining the signatures generated at different resistance thresholds. This approach aimed to improve the predictive accuracy by leveraging the strengths of multiple models.\n\nOverall, the evaluation method involved a combination of permutation analysis, log-loss minimization, cross-validation, and ensemble averaging to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the derived gene signatures. These steps collectively demonstrated the effectiveness of the method in predicting responses to platinum chemotherapy agents.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our evaluation, we primarily focused on misclassification rates and log-loss as our key performance metrics. These metrics were chosen to assess the accuracy and reliability of our gene signatures in predicting patient responses to chemotherapy agents.\n\nMisclassification rates were calculated to determine the proportion of incorrect predictions made by our models. This metric is crucial for understanding how often our models fail to correctly classify patients as either sensitive or resistant to the drugs. We reported misclassification rates for various gene signatures, such as those derived from cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin. For instance, our best-performing cisplatin gene signatures had misclassification rates as low as 7.7%, indicating high accuracy in predicting patient responses.\n\nLog-loss, on the other hand, measures the uncertainty of our models' predictions. It provides a more nuanced evaluation by considering the probability distributions of the predictions rather than just the final class labels. We used log-loss to optimize our gene signatures and reported the results for different resistance thresholds. This metric is particularly useful for comparing the performance of models that produce probabilistic outputs.\n\nIn addition to these primary metrics, we also reported the area under the curve (AUC) for some of our gene signatures. The AUC provides a single scalar value that summarizes the performance of a binary classifier across all possible classification thresholds. For example, one of our cisplatin gene signatures (Cis3) had an AUC of 0.64 when validated against TCGA patients with bladder cancer. However, the AUC can vary significantly depending on the dataset and the basis of expected outcomes, as seen in our comparison with the dataset reported by Als et al.\n\nWe also evaluated the specificity of our gene signatures by assessing their performance on patients treated with different drugs. For instance, we found that our cisplatin gene signatures could accurately predict the outcomes of patients treated with carboplatin, albeit with some differences in accuracy.\n\nOverall, our set of performance metrics is representative of the standards used in the literature for evaluating predictive models in oncology. We believe that reporting misclassification rates, log-loss, and AUC provides a comprehensive view of our models' performance and their potential clinical utility.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we employed a comprehensive approach to evaluate the performance of our machine learning models, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVMs), in predicting chemotherapy responses. We conducted a permutation analysis using randomized cell line labels and random sets of genes to assess the significance of our derived SVMs. This analysis helped us determine whether the observed performance of our gene signatures could have arisen by chance.\n\nFor cisplatin, we generated 10,000 gene signatures based on random gene selection and found that these had higher rates of misclassification compared to our best-performing SVM gene signatures. Similarly, for carboplatin and oxaliplatin, we created random cell line label combinations and found that only a few signatures had lower error rates than our biochemically-inspired signatures.\n\nWe also minimized for log-loss instead of misclassification. The random gene analysis for cisplatin resulted in gene signatures with higher log-loss than our initial cisplatin gene set. When we performed a log-loss-based random label analysis, we found that a small percentage of random label gene signatures had a lower log-loss than our cisplatin signature at the same GI50 threshold. This finding was not entirely surprising, as it depends on the GI50 threshold used for labeling.\n\nRegarding the specificity of our cisplatin gene signatures, we evaluated their performance on patients treated with other drugs. The best-performing cisplatin gene signatures accurately predicted disease-free and recurrent patients, although with slightly lower accuracy compared to platin-treated patients. This indicates that our gene signatures are more effective in modeling gene expression changes in patients treated with platin drugs.\n\nIn summary, our evaluation involved comparing our models to random baselines and assessing their performance across different drug treatments. This rigorous comparison helped us validate the robustness and specificity of our gene signatures in predicting chemotherapy responses.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the gene signatures involved several statistical methods to assess their significance and performance. Permutation analysis was used to determine if the observed performance of the gene signatures could have arisen by chance. This was done by randomizing cell line labels and using random sets of genes. For cisplatin, 10,000 gene signatures based on random gene selection had higher rates of misclassification than the best median SVM gene signatures. This indicates that the performance of the derived gene signatures is statistically significant and not due to random chance.\n\nThe significance of the gene signatures was further evaluated using different thresholds and metrics. For instance, when minimizing for log-loss, the random gene analysis resulted in gene signatures with a higher log-loss than the signature generated with the initial cisplatin gene set. This suggests that the derived gene signatures are robust and perform better than random selections.\n\nAdditionally, the specificity of the cisplatin gene signatures was assessed by evaluating their performance on patients treated with other drugs. The best-performing cisplatin gene signatures accurately predicted disease-free and recurrent patients, although with slightly lower accuracy compared to platin-treated patients. This demonstrates the generalizability of the gene signatures to different treatment contexts.\n\nThe use of ensemble models also provided a way to combine multiple gene signatures, potentially improving overall accuracy and avoiding issues with overfitting. Ensemble averaging of gene signatures generated at different resistance thresholds showed a small increase in accuracy, better representing the sensitive, disease-free class. This approach helps to mitigate problems with poor performance and overfitting by leveraging the strengths of multiple models.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation of the gene signatures included rigorous statistical methods to ensure their significance and performance. The results indicate that the derived gene signatures are robust, statistically significant, and superior to random selections and baselines. The use of ensemble models further enhances the reliability and generalizability of the predictions.",
