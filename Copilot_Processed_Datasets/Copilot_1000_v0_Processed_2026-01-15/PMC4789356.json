  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from UniProt/SwissProt, a comprehensive resource for protein sequence and annotation data. The dataset was compiled using keyword searches for terms such as \"flavohemoglobin,\" \"truncated hemoglobin,\" and \"single domain hemoglobin bacteria.\" This initial search yielded 1539 entries from various bacterial organisms.\n\nTo ensure the quality and relevance of the dataset, several filtering steps were applied. Entries annotated as \"fragments,\" \"isoforms,\" \"potentials,\" \"similarity,\" or \"probables\" were removed using a PERL script. Additionally, a similarity filter with a 90% cutoff was applied to ensure that no two sequences had more than 90% similarity. However, this similarity filter was not applied to the single domain hemoglobin (sHb) subset due to its small size and high similarity among annotated sHbs.\n\nAfter curation, the final dataset consisted of 333 high-quality bacterial hemoglobin-like (HbL) proteins. This included 217 flavohemoglobin (flavoHb) sequences, 87 truncated hemoglobin (trHb) sequences, and 29 single domain hemoglobin (sHb) sequences. These proteins were derived from over 246 bacterial species, providing a diverse and representative sample for analysis.\n\nThe sequence length distributions and similarity ranges were also studied for individual domains of HbL proteins. For instance, the longest flavoHb sequences with FAD/NAD-binding domains ranged between 300 and 500 amino acids. The sequence similarity within the trHb subclass showed that 50% of the sequences had 31\u201340% similarity, while 30% had a similarity range between 41 and 50%. For the flavoHb subclass, 40% of the sequences had a similarity range between 61 and 70%, and 25% had a similarity between 51 and 60%.\n\nThe domain architecture of HbL proteins was characterized using tools like Pfam and InterPro, providing a comprehensive understanding of the structural organization of these proteins. This curated dataset serves as a robust foundation for developing and evaluating prediction models for HbL proteins and their subclasses.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into five splits for evaluation purposes. This division is part of a 5-fold cross-validation process. In this method, the entire dataset is randomly split into five sets of approximately equal size. Four of these sets are used for training the model, while the remaining one set is used for testing. This process is repeated five times, with each of the five sets being used as the test set once. This ensures that every data point is used for both training and testing, providing a robust evaluation of the model's performance.\n\nThe specific distribution of data points in each split is not detailed, but it is mentioned that the splits are of approximately equal size. This implies that each split contains roughly one-fifth of the total dataset. The exact number of data points in each split would depend on the total size of the dataset, but the goal is to maintain a balanced distribution across all splits to ensure fair and comprehensive testing.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset used in this study was initially retrieved from UniProt/SwissProt using specific keyword searches, resulting in 1539 entries. To ensure the dataset's quality and reduce redundancy, several steps were taken.\n\nFirst, protein sequences annotated as \"fragments,\" \"isoforms,\" \"potentials,\" \"similarity,\" or \"probables\" were removed using a PERL script. This step was crucial to eliminate low-quality or uncertain sequences that could introduce noise into the analysis.\n\nNext, a similarity filter with a 90% similarity cutoff was applied. This filter ensured that no two sequences in the dataset had more than 90% similarity, which is essential for creating a diverse and representative dataset. However, this filter was not applied to the single-domain hemoglobin (sHb) subset due to its small size (29 proteins) and the relatively high similarity between annotated sHbs.\n\nThe final dataset consisted of 333 high-quality bacterial hemoglobin-like (HbL) proteins, including 217 flavohemoglobin (flavoHb), 87 truncated hemoglobin (trHb), and 29 single-domain hemoglobin (sHb) proteins from over 246 bacterial species.\n\nTo evaluate the performance of the HbL classification, a 5-fold cross-validation method was employed. This method involved randomly dividing the whole dataset into five sets of approximately equal size. Four sets were used for training, and one set was used for testing. This process was repeated five times, with different sets chosen for testing each time. This approach ensured that the training and test sets were independent and that the results were robust and generalizable.\n\nThe distribution of sequence lengths and similarities within the dataset was also studied. For example, the longest flavoHb sequences had lengths between 300 and 500 amino acids. Additionally, the sequence similarity between all HbL subclasses was analyzed, providing insights into the diversity and representativeness of the dataset.\n\nIn summary, the dataset was carefully curated to reduce redundancy and ensure high quality. The use of 5-fold cross-validation further ensured that the training and test sets were independent, and the results were reliable and generalizable. The distribution of sequence lengths and similarities within the dataset was also analyzed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's characteristics.",
  "dataset/availability": "The dataset used in this study was originally retrieved from UniProt/SwissProt using specific keyword searches. The dataset consisted of bacterial hemoglobin-like (HbL) proteins, including flavohemoglobin, truncated hemoglobin, and single-domain hemoglobin. After curation and applying a similarity filter, the final dataset comprised 333 high-quality bacterial HbL proteins from over 246 bacterial species.\n\nThe dataset is not explicitly mentioned to be released in a public forum. However, the sequences were obtained from UniProt/SwissProt, which is a publicly accessible database. The specific entries and the curated dataset used in this study are not detailed in terms of public availability or licensing. Therefore, it is not clear whether the exact dataset used in this study is publicly available or under what terms it might be shared.\n\nThe similarity filter applied ensured that no two sequences had more than 90% similarity, except for the single-domain hemoglobin subset due to its small size and high similarity among annotated sequences. This filtering process was enforced using a PERL script to remove redundant sequences and maintain the quality of the dataset.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in our study is Support Vector Machine (SVM). SVM is a well-established and widely used tool for solving two-class classification problems, particularly in computational biology.\n\nThe SVM algorithm employed in our research is not new. It is a proven method that has been extensively used and validated in various fields, including bioinformatics. The specific implementation of SVM used in our work is SVMlight, a freely downloadable package available online. This package was chosen for its effectiveness and reliability in handling classification tasks.\n\nThe reason the SVM algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that our focus is on its application in bioinformatics, specifically for the prediction and classification of bacterial hemoglobin-like (HbL) proteins. The innovation lies in how we applied and optimized SVM for this particular biological problem, rather than in the development of a new machine-learning algorithm. Our study contributes to the field by demonstrating the effectiveness of SVM in classifying HbL proteins and their subclasses, using features such as amino acid composition, dipeptide composition, and evolutionary information.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. It is not a meta-predictor.\n\nThe model employs several different methods for classification, including single amino acid composition (AC), dipeptide composition (DC), position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), and maximum to minimum (MM) profiles. These methods are used independently to develop SVM modules for classifying HbL proteins and their subfamilies. The performance of each method is evaluated separately, and the results are presented in tables.\n\nThe training data for each method is independent, as each method uses its own set of features derived from the protein sequences. The SVM training is carried out by optimizing various kernel function parameters and the value of the regularization parameter C for each method. The performance of the SVM prediction modules is estimated by 5-fold cross-validation, ensuring that the training and testing sets are independent for each fold.\n\nThe model also includes a hybrid system that combines AC and DC profiles. This hybrid system achieves the highest accuracy in HbL versus non-HbL protein classification and in the classification of sHb, flavoHb, and trHb proteins. The hybrid system uses the features from both AC and DC profiles as input to the SVM, but it is not a meta-predictor in the sense of combining the outputs of other machine-learning algorithms. Instead, it combines the features from two different methods to improve the performance of the SVM classification.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, several methods were employed to encode and preprocess the data for the machine-learning algorithm. One of the key techniques used was dipeptide composition (DC), which encapsulates global information about each protein sequence. This method provides a fixed pattern length of 400 (20 \u00d7 20) by calculating the fraction of each dipeptide in the sequence.\n\nAnother important encoding method was the amino acid composition (AC), which involves calculating the fraction of each of the 20 natural amino acids in a protein. This was done using an alphabetical ordering of the amino acids. Additionally, the maximum to minimum (MM) composition vector was obtained by sorting the average amino acid composition from the most abundant to the least abundant. A specific residue order was used to calculate the MM profile.\n\nPosition-specific scoring matrices (PSSM) were also utilized. These matrices provide a score for each amino acid at each position in the sequence, which was then normalized to values between 0 and 1. The PSSM composition was computed in a vector of 400 dimensions by calculating the composition of occurrences of each type of amino acid corresponding to each type present in the protein sequence. Each element of this input vector was divided by the length of the sequence to normalize it.\n\nFor the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, the data was converted into a suitable format using the col2svm program. This program assigns positive and negative labels to the sequences, which are then used for training the SVM model. The SVM training involved optimizing various kernel function parameters and the regularization parameter C.\n\nIn summary, the data encoding and preprocessing involved calculating dipeptide composition, amino acid composition, and PSSM, followed by normalization and conversion into a format suitable for SVM training. These steps ensured that the data was in an appropriate form for the machine-learning algorithm to effectively classify the protein sequences.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In the optimization process, several parameters were considered and tuned to enhance the performance of the models. The primary parameters involved in the optimization were the kernel function parameters and the regularization parameter C for the Support Vector Machine (SVM). The kernel function parameters varied depending on the type of kernel used, such as the radial basis function (RBF) kernel, which includes the gamma factor (\u03b3). The optimization aimed to find the best combination of these parameters to achieve the highest accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC).\n\nThe selection of parameters was systematic and involved a thorough evaluation using cross-validation techniques. Specifically, 5-fold cross-validation was employed, where the dataset was divided into five subsets. Four subsets were used for training, and one subset was used for testing. This process was repeated five times, each time using a different subset for testing. The performance metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and MCC, were calculated for each fold, and the average performance was used to select the optimal parameters.\n\nThe optimization process ensured that the models were robust and generalizable, as the parameters were chosen based on their performance across multiple subsets of the data. This approach helped in identifying the most effective parameters for discriminating between HbL proteins and non-HbL proteins, as well as for classifying different subtypes of HbL proteins.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized several types of input features to encapsulate the global information about each protein sequence. The dipeptide composition (DC) feature set, for instance, provides a fixed pattern length of 400, as it considers all possible combinations of 20 amino acids taken two at a time.\n\nThe amino acid composition (AC) feature set is based on the average composition of amino acids in the sequences, ordered alphabetically. Additionally, we employed the maximum to minimum (MM) composition vector, which sorts the average amino acid composition from the most to the least abundant, following a specific residue order.\n\nWe also incorporated the position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) to capture evolutionary information. This matrix provides a profile of the conservation of each position in the sequence across related proteins.\n\nFeature selection was not explicitly performed in the traditional sense, as we relied on the inherent properties of the feature sets to capture relevant information. The parameters for the support vector machine (SVM) were optimized using the training data, ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data. This optimization process indirectly influences the effective use of features by adjusting the kernel function parameters and the regularization parameter.\n\nThe combination of these feature sets\u2014DC, AC, MM, and PSSM\u2014allowed us to achieve high prediction accuracy and robustness in classifying hemoglobin-like (HbL) proteins. The use of these comprehensive feature sets ensured that our model could effectively distinguish between different types of HbL proteins and non-HbL proteins.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study utilized Support Vector Machine (SVM) models, which are known for their effectiveness in handling high-dimensional spaces and are particularly well-suited for classification tasks in computational biology.\n\nThe number of parameters in our models is indeed large, given the complexity of the feature vectors used, such as dipeptide composition (DC), amino acid composition (AC), position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), and maximum to minimum (MM) profiles. However, over-fitting was mitigated through several strategies. Firstly, the models were trained using a 5-fold cross-validation approach, ensuring that each model was evaluated on a separate test set, which helps in assessing the generalization performance. Secondly, the optimization of kernel function parameters and the regularization parameter C was carefully conducted to balance the model's complexity and its ability to generalize to unseen data. This regularization helps in preventing the model from becoming too complex and overfitting the training data.\n\nTo rule out under-fitting, the performance of the models was evaluated using multiple metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). The high values obtained for these metrics across different datasets and subfamilies indicate that the models are sufficiently complex to capture the underlying patterns in the data. Additionally, the use of different feature types (AC, DC, PSSM, MM) provides a robust representation of the protein sequences, reducing the risk of under-fitting. The hybrid system, which combines AC and DC profiles, further enhances the model's ability to capture both local and global sequence information, thereby improving its predictive performance.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed a regularization technique to prevent overfitting during the training of our support vector machine (SVM) models. Specifically, we optimized the regularization parameter C, which controls the trade-off between achieving a low training error and a low testing error. By tuning this parameter, we aimed to find an optimal balance that would generalize well to unseen data, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting. This approach is crucial in computational biology, where the complexity of biological data can lead to models that perform well on training data but poorly on new, unseen data.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters used in our study are reported within the publication. Specifically, details about the support vector machine (SVM) training process, including the optimization of various kernel function parameters and the regularization parameter C, are provided. The SVMlight package, which is freely downloadable, was utilized for this purpose.\n\nThe performance evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), are also thoroughly documented. These metrics were calculated using a 5-fold cross-validation approach, ensuring a robust assessment of the model's performance.\n\nRegarding the availability of model files and optimization parameters, the publication does not explicitly mention the provision of these files. However, the methods and configurations described are sufficient for replication by other researchers. The SVMlight package, being open-source, allows for the implementation of the described models and optimization processes.\n\nFor those interested in accessing the supplementary materials, such as figures and tables, these are referenced within the text and can be found in the associated supplementary documents. These documents provide additional details that support the main findings and methods described in the publication.",
  "model/interpretability": "The models employed in this study, particularly the Support Vector Machine (SVM) modules, are generally considered black-box models. This means that while they are highly effective in classification tasks, the internal workings and decision-making processes are not easily interpretable. The SVM modules utilize various kernel functions and optimization parameters, which contribute to their high predictive accuracy but do not provide clear, human-understandable explanations for their predictions.\n\nHowever, certain aspects of the models can be made more transparent through the use of feature vectors and composition profiles. For instance, the dipeptide composition (DC) and amino acid composition (AC) feature vectors encapsulate global information about each protein sequence. The DC profile provides a fixed pattern length of 400, representing the fraction of each dipeptide in the sequence. Similarly, the AC profile uses an alphabetical ordering of amino acids to calculate the average composition. These profiles offer a structured way to understand how different sequences are represented and classified.\n\nAdditionally, the position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) and maximum to minimum (MM) profiles add layers of interpretability. The PSSM captures evolutionary information by scoring the likelihood of each amino acid at specific positions in the sequence, while the MM profile sorts amino acid compositions from most to least abundant. These profiles help in understanding the sequence characteristics that the SVM modules use for classification.\n\nThe confusion matrix and performance evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), also provide insights into the model's performance. The confusion matrix shows the actual versus predicted classifications, highlighting any misclassifications. Performance metrics offer a quantitative measure of the model's effectiveness, ensuring that the predictions are reliable and accurate.\n\nIn summary, while the SVM modules themselves are black-box models, the use of feature vectors, composition profiles, and performance evaluation metrics adds a degree of transparency. These elements help in understanding how the models process input data and make predictions, even if the internal decision-making process remains opaque.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a classification model. It is designed to classify hemoglobin-like (HbL) proteins into their respective subfamilies, such as single-domain hemoglobins (sHb), flavohemoglobins (flavoHb), and truncated hemoglobins (trHb). The model uses support vector machines (SVM) and various feature extraction methods, including amino acid composition (AC), dipeptide composition (DC), position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), and maximum to minimum (MM) profiles. The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). The model demonstrates high prediction accuracy and the ability to correctly classify a large majority of HbL proteins into their independent classes. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis further supports the model's strong performance, with high area under the curve (AUC) values indicating effective classification capabilities.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "The source code for the methods described in this study is not publicly released. However, the developed approach is accessible through an online server named BacHbpred. This server is implemented on the World Wide Web and is freely accessible at a specified URL. The server provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to submit their query sequences. The results are then displayed in a simple tabular format. The scripts of the methods are written in CGI-PERL programming language, and the interface is designed using HTML.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the method involved a comprehensive approach to ensure the robustness and accuracy of the predictions. The primary evaluation technique used was 5-fold cross-validation. This process involved randomly dividing the entire dataset into five subsets of approximately equal size. Four of these subsets were used for training the model, while the remaining subset was used for testing. This procedure was repeated five times, with each subset serving as the test set once. This method helps to ensure that the model's performance is consistent and not dependent on a particular subset of data.\n\nThe performance of the classification models was estimated using several key metrics: accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). Accuracy measures the percentage of correctly predicted positive and negative examples. Sensitivity, also known as recall, indicates the percentage of positive examples (HbL proteins) that are correctly predicted as positive. Specificity measures the percentage of negative examples (non-HbL proteins) that are correctly predicted as negative. The Matthews correlation coefficient provides a balanced measure of the quality of binary classifications, taking into account true and false positives and negatives.\n\nAdditionally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted using sensitivity and specificity to calculate the area under the curve (AUC). The AUC values for different models (based on amino acid composition, dipeptide composition, PSSM profile, and MM profile) were reported, providing a visual and quantitative assessment of the models' performance. The AUC scores indicated that the models performed well, with values close to 1, suggesting high predictive accuracy.\n\nThe evaluation also included a comparison with homology-based methods such as BLAST and Pfam. This comparison involved searching the sequences against known protein databases and evaluating the performance of the SVM models against these established methods. The results showed that the SVM models were able to accurately predict a large majority of HbL proteins and classify them properly into their respective subclasses.\n\nFurthermore, the performance of the models was analyzed using confusion matrices, which provided detailed information about the actual and predicted classifications. This analysis was particularly important for unbalanced datasets, where the error rate of the classifier might not represent the true performance. The confusion matrices helped to identify any confusion between classes and provided insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation method involved a rigorous cross-validation process, the use of multiple performance metrics, ROC curve analysis, and comparisons with established homology-based methods. These evaluations collectively demonstrated the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed models for predicting HbL proteins and their subclasses.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed several performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of our classification models. The primary metrics reported include accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). These metrics provide a comprehensive view of the model's performance across different aspects.\n\nAccuracy measures the overall correctness of the predictions, representing the percentage of correctly predicted positive and negative examples. Sensitivity, also known as the true positive rate, indicates the proportion of actual positive examples (HbL proteins) that are correctly identified. Specificity, or the true negative rate, reflects the percentage of actual negative examples (non-HbL proteins) that are correctly predicted. The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) is a balanced measure that considers true and false positives and negatives, providing a single value that summarizes the quality of the binary classification.\n\nAdditionally, we used the false positive rate (FPR) to further analyze the performance, especially in cases where the dataset is unbalanced. The confusion matrix was utilized to visualize the performance and identify any confusion between classes. This matrix helps in understanding how often the system misclassifies one class as another, which is crucial for datasets with varying class distributions.\n\nThe use of these metrics is representative of standard practices in the field of computational biology and machine learning. They provide a robust evaluation framework, ensuring that our models are thoroughly assessed and comparable to other studies in the literature. The combination of these metrics allows for a detailed analysis of the model's strengths and weaknesses, ensuring that our classification system is reliable and effective for predicting HbL proteins and their subclasses.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "A comparison was conducted to evaluate the performance of the developed SVM models against publicly available methods. Specifically, BLAST-search and HMM sequence profiles from Pfam were used for this comparison. The BLAST-search involved an E-value cutoff of 0.00001 against the UniProt/SwissProt database, retaining sequences with similarity between 90% and 30%. This filter was applied to truncated hemoglobin (trHb) and flavohemoglobin (flavoHb) but not to single-domain hemoglobin (sHb) due to the smaller number of sequences retrieved.\n\nThe results from the BLAST-search were analyzed using various SVM HbL-models, including AC, DC, PSSM, and MM. Out of 2451 sequences, 1941 were predicted as positive, 37 as negative, and 473 were predicted by one, two, or three approaches. Additionally, individual HbL class models were used to predict sequences from the BLAST-search, resulting in 103, 589, and 942 sequences being positively predicted for sHb, flavoHb, and trHb, respectively.\n\nThe performance of the SVM models was also compared to Pfam, showing that the SVM methods performed similarly but identified additional domains not detected by Pfam. For instance, no flavoHb proteins were identified as cytochrome reductase domains in Pfam, whereas the SVM models could detect this domain.\n\nFurthermore, the developed SVM methods were tested on a whole-bacterial genome prediction of Bacillus subtilis, which contains 4053 sequences. The results showed that 76 proteins were predicted as positive in all approaches, including one annotated HbL sequence and 11 uncharacterized proteins. This indicates that the SVM models are effective in identifying both known and potentially new HbL proteins.\n\nIn summary, the comparison with BLAST-search and Pfam, along with the genome-wide prediction, demonstrates the robustness and accuracy of the developed SVM models in identifying and classifying HbL proteins.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our models was conducted using 5-fold cross-validation, which provides a robust measure of performance by dividing the dataset into five subsets and training on four while testing on the remaining one. This process is repeated five times, ensuring that each subset is used for testing once.\n\nPerformance metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) were calculated for each fold. The average values of these metrics across the five folds were reported, along with their standard deviations. This approach allows us to assess the variability and reliability of our results.\n\nThe standard deviations provide an indication of the confidence intervals for our performance metrics. For instance, the average accuracy for the amino acid composition (AC) method is 85.76% with a standard deviation of 1.59%, suggesting a relatively consistent performance across different folds.\n\nStatistical significance was evaluated through the comparison of different methods. The performance of our models was compared against baselines and other approaches, such as BLAST/PSI-BLAST and Pfam. The results indicate that our methods, particularly those using PSSM and MM profiles, outperformed these baselines in terms of accuracy and other metrics.\n\nThe receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the curve (AUC) further support the robustness of our models. The AUC values for different methods were reported, showing that our models achieved high AUC scores, indicating strong discriminative power.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics have associated standard deviations that provide insights into their confidence intervals. The results are statistically significant, demonstrating the superiority of our methods over baselines and other approaches. The use of 5-fold cross-validation and detailed performance analysis ensures that our claims of method superiority are well-supported.",
