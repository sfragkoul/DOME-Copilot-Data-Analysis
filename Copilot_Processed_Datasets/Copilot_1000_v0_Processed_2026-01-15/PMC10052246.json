  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset utilized in this study was sourced from the state mental health and addiction authority\u2019s database. This database contains comprehensive information on demographic, diagnostic, assessment, and treatment service details of individuals involved in behavioral health services. The data retrieved included the last assessment completed during the calendar years 2019 and 2020.\n\nThe study involved a total of 90,500 data points, encompassing three racial groups: Asian Americans (544 individuals), White Americans (78,704 individuals), and Black Americans (11,252 individuals). These participants were either actively engaged in behavioral health services or had completed an episode of care within the specified years.\n\nThe dataset has been used previously in exploratory factor analysis, which identified five factors with adequate to good internal consistency. These factors included personal recovery, trauma and stress-related problems, substance use risks, self-sufficiency, and cultural-linguistic considerations. The dataset has also been utilized in the development and standardization of the Adult Needs and Strengths Assessment (ANSA), which is a comprehensive tool for assessing psycho-social factors in individuals with mental health and/or substance use challenges.\n\nThe dataset has not been widely used by the broader community, but it has been instrumental in informing the standardization of the ANSA instrument and in understanding the behavioral health needs and strengths of different racial groups within the state's behavioral health service system.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was split into three groups based on race. The first group consisted of Asian Americans, with a sample size of 544 individuals. The second group comprised White Americans, with a significantly larger sample size of 78,704 individuals. The third group included Black Americans, with a sample size of 11,252 individuals.\n\nThe distribution of data points across these groups shows a notable disparity in sample sizes. The White American group had the largest number of participants, followed by the Black American group, and then the Asian American group, which had the smallest sample size. This imbalance was addressed using a balance node provided by SPSS Modeler to correct for the differences in sample sizes among the racial groups, ensuring a more accurate classification model.\n\nThe dataset was further divided based on the year of assessment, serving as a proxy for the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were either actively involved in behavioral health services or had completed an episode of care during the calendar years 2019 or 2020. The last assessment data completed during these years were retrieved for analysis.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "Not applicable",
  "dataset/availability": "The data utilized in this study were derived from a publicly funded behavioral health service system, specifically from the state mental health and addiction authority\u2019s database. This database includes demographic, diagnostic, assessment, and treatment service information for individuals actively involved in or who had completed an episode of care during the calendar years 2019 or 2020.\n\nThe data splits used in the analysis were determined by the study's focus on comparing Asian Americans with non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Black Americans. The dataset was balanced using a balance node provided by SPSS Modeler to correct imbalances among racial groups, ensuring a more accurate classification model.\n\nHowever, the specific data splits and the raw dataset itself are not publicly released. The study emphasizes the use of secondary administrative data, which is subject to privacy and confidentiality regulations. Therefore, the data is not available in a public forum. The enforcement of data privacy and confidentiality was managed through institutional review board approval and adherence to relevant ethical guidelines, such as the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in this study is a decision tree-based method known as Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID). This algorithm is not new; it has been utilized in various fields for several decades. CHAID is a well-established technique for detecting interactions between variables and building classification trees.\n\nThe decision to use CHAID in this study was driven by its ability to handle categorical data and identify complex relationships among predictors. It is particularly useful for exploring interactions and structural linkages among variables, making it suitable for analyzing behavioral health data.\n\nThe choice of CHAID aligns with the study's focus on identifying race-specific differences in behavioral health needs and strengths. The algorithm's capability to detect intersectionality and structural linkages among predictors was crucial for understanding the unique challenges faced by different racial groups, particularly Asian Americans.\n\nThe study's primary objective was to examine how demographic characteristics, behavioral health functional needs, and strengths significantly predicted outcomes for Asian Americans in behavioral health services. CHAID's strengths in data mining and pattern recognition made it an appropriate tool for this analysis.\n\nThe findings from this study provide evidence that Asian Americans who participated in publicly funded behavioral health services faced unique challenges, such as language barriers and cultural stress. The use of CHAID helped identify these key factors, demonstrating the algorithm's effectiveness in uncovering complex relationships in the data.\n\nIn summary, CHAID was chosen for its proven track record in handling categorical data and detecting interactions among variables. Its application in this study was driven by the need to understand the specific behavioral health needs and strengths of Asian Americans, contributing to the development of culturally appropriate interventions.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employed in this study does not utilize data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it relies on a single machine-learning method known as Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID). CHAID is a decision tree technique used for classification and prediction. It works by recursively partitioning the data into segments that are more homogeneous with respect to the target variable.\n\nCHAID is particularly useful for identifying interactions between variables and for handling categorical data, which makes it suitable for the analysis conducted in this study. The algorithm builds a classification tree by detecting intersectionality and structural linkages among predictors. It starts with the predictor that has the lowest p-value and continues splitting the data recursively until terminal nodes are reached, where the results are no longer statistically significant.\n\nThe study does not involve a meta-predictor approach, which would typically combine the outputs of multiple machine-learning models. Instead, CHAID operates independently on the dataset, ensuring that the training data is used in a straightforward manner without the complexity of integrating outputs from different algorithms.\n\nThe independence of the training data is maintained throughout the process. The CHAID algorithm ensures that each split is based on the statistical significance of the predictors, and the Bonferroni-adjusted p-value is used to control for multiple comparisons. This approach helps in identifying the most important predictors for the target variable while avoiding overfitting and ensuring the robustness of the model.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, the data encoding and preprocessing were crucial steps to ensure the machine-learning algorithm, specifically the Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID), could effectively analyze the behavioral health data. The data consisted of demographic variables and assessment ratings from the Adult Needs and Strengths Assessment (ANSA).\n\nDemographic variables such as age, gender, race, and assessment year were included. Gender was categorized into male, female, and transgender. The assessment year served as a proxy for the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Race was compared among Asian Americans, non-Hispanic White Americans, and non-Hispanic Black Americans.\n\nFor the ANSA items, each need was rated on a 4-point scale: 0 indicating no evidence of a need, 1 signifying a significant history of the need or a need not currently impacting functioning, 2 indicating a need that interferes with functioning, and 3 denoting a dangerous or disabling need. Strength items were rated based on their usefulness in addressing identified needs and supporting well-being, with a similar 4-point scale: 0 for an essential strength in planning, 1 for a strength that could be used in planning, 2 for a strength that must be developed, and 3 for no identified strength.\n\nTo facilitate the machine-learning process, ratings of 2 or 3 on need-related items were recoded as actionable, indicating that intervention was required. Similarly, ratings of 2 or 3 on strength items were recoded as non-actionable, suggesting that intervention was not required. Ratings of 0 and 1 on strength items were recoded as actionable, indicating useful strengths.\n\nThe CHAID algorithm was utilized to build classification trees by detecting intersectionality and structural linkages among predictors. This process involved recursive splitting of the data based on the predictor with the lowest p-value until the terminal node was reached. The algorithm grew to four levels, and all descriptive analyses were conducted using SPSS 26, while CHAID was run using IBM SPSS Modeler subscription version 1.0.\n\nTo address sample size differences by racial group, a balance node provided by SPSS Modeler was used to correct imbalances. This balancing process was essential for creating a better classification model, especially when the binary target variable was not equally distributed. The classification tree model identified the strongest linkages between a set of predictors for Asian Americans, White Americans, and Black Americans in behavioral health treatment.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized a machine learning-based data mining algorithm known as Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) to identify race-specific differences among various predictors. The model considered a wide range of predictors, including demographic variables such as age, gender, race, and assessment year, as well as behavioral health-related needs and strengths.\n\nThe number of parameters (p) used in the model was extensive, encompassing multiple domains assessed by the Adult Needs and Strengths Assessment (ANSA). These domains included personal recovery, trauma and stress-related problems, substance use risks, self-sufficiency, and cultural-linguistic considerations. Each domain contained several items, which were rated on a 4-point scale, contributing to the overall complexity and richness of the data.\n\nThe selection of parameters was guided by exploratory factor analysis, which identified five factors with adequate to good internal consistency. These factors reflected subpopulations of individuals receiving mental health services, the role of strength items, and cultural considerations. The CHAID algorithm was particularly effective in handling the vast number of predictors and integrating them in non-linear and highly interactive ways, focusing on risk algorithms rather than individual risk factors.\n\nThe model's ability to detect intersectionality and structural linkages among predictors allowed for a comprehensive analysis of behavioral health-related needs and strengths across different racial groups. The classification tree model built by CHAID identified the strongest linkages between predictors, providing insights into the unique challenges faced by Asian Americans in behavioral health services.\n\nIn summary, the model utilized a large number of parameters, carefully selected through exploratory factor analysis and refined using the CHAID algorithm. This approach ensured that the model could effectively capture the complex interactions among various predictors, leading to a robust and informative analysis of behavioral health needs and strengths.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized a comprehensive set of input features to predict behavioral health needs and strengths among different racial groups. The features included demographic variables such as age, gender, race, and assessment year. Additionally, we considered various behavioral health-related items categorized into domains like personal recovery, trauma and stress-related problems, substance use risks, self-sufficiency, and cultural-linguistic considerations.\n\nThe total number of features (f) used as input was substantial, encompassing both demographic data and detailed assessments from the Adult Needs and Strengths Assessment (ANSA). This assessment tool includes multiple items rated on a 4-point scale, covering a wide range of needs and strengths.\n\nFeature selection was performed using the Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) algorithm, a machine learning-based data mining technique. CHAID was employed to detect race-specific differences and identify the most significant predictors for Asian Americans. The process involved recursive splitting of data based on statistical significance, specifically using Bonferroni-adjusted p-values less than 0.05 for chi-squared tests.\n\nTo ensure the integrity of the feature selection process, it was conducted using the training set only. This approach helped in building a robust classification tree model that could effectively differentiate behavioral health needs and strengths among Asian Americans, White Americans, and Black Americans. The model's performance was evaluated using the area under the ROC curve (AUC), which was found to be acceptable for research purposes, with values of 0.71 and 0.70 for the respective comparisons.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study utilized the Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) algorithm, a machine learning-based data mining technique. This approach was chosen to handle the vast number of predictors and integrate them in non-linear and highly interactive ways, focusing on risk algorithms rather than individual risk factors.\n\nThe dataset included four demographic variables (age, gender, race, and assessment year) and various behavioral health-related needs and strengths. The number of predictors was indeed large, but the sample sizes for the different racial groups varied significantly, with Asian Americans (N = 544), White Americans (N = 78,704), and Black Americans (N = 11,252). To address potential overfitting, especially given the disparity in sample sizes, a balance node provided by SPSS Modeler was used. This process corrected imbalances among racial groups, ensuring a better classification model where the binary target variable was not equally distributed.\n\nTo rule out overfitting, the recursive splitting process in CHAID continued until the terminal node was reached, with the predictor having the lowest p-value being the first split. This process, called repeated group separation, enabled the detection of the least significant predictor for Asian Americans by repeatedly splitting child nodes until the results were no longer statistically significant. The chi-squared tests for repeated node separation were based on the Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 0.05, ensuring that the splits were statistically meaningful.\n\nUnderfitting was addressed by the nature of the CHAID algorithm, which builds classification trees by detecting intersectionality and structural linkages among predictors. This method allowed for the identification of complex relationships within the data, ensuring that the model captured the necessary patterns without being too simplistic.\n\nThe classification tree grew to four levels, indicating a sufficient depth to capture the underlying structure of the data without being overly complex. All descriptive analyses were conducted using SPSS 26, and CHAID was run using IBM SPSS Modeler subscription version 1.0, ensuring robust and reliable statistical procedures.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed the Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) algorithm, which inherently includes a form of regularization through its recursive partitioning process. This method helps to prevent overfitting by ensuring that the splits in the classification tree are statistically significant. Specifically, we used Bonferroni-adjusted p-values to determine the significance of each split, with a threshold of less than 0.05. This adjustment helps to control for the increased risk of Type I errors that can occur with multiple comparisons, thereby reducing the likelihood of identifying spurious relationships in the data.\n\nAdditionally, the CHAID algorithm stops splitting when the results are no longer statistically significant, which acts as a form of pruning. This means that the tree does not grow unnecessarily large, further mitigating the risk of overfitting. The classification tree grew to four levels, indicating a balanced approach between model complexity and generalization.\n\nMoreover, we addressed sample size imbalances among racial groups by using a balance node provided by SPSS Modeler. This process helps to ensure that the classification model is not biased towards the majority group, thereby improving the robustness and generalizability of the model.",
  "optimization/config": "Not applicable.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a black box but rather a transparent one, as it utilizes the Chi-Squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) algorithm. CHAID is a decision tree technique that is inherently interpretable, making it possible to understand the relationships between predictors and the target variable.\n\nThe CHAID algorithm works by recursively splitting the data into segments that are more homogeneous with respect to the target variable. This process results in a decision tree where each node represents a split based on a predictor variable, and the branches represent the possible outcomes of that split. The terminal nodes, or leaves, of the tree represent the final segments of the data, which are as homogeneous as possible with respect to the target variable.\n\nIn this study, the CHAID algorithm was used to identify the strongest linkages between a set of predictors for Asian Americans. The predictors that were found to be most important in differentiating the behavioral health needs and strengths of Asian Americans from those of White and Black Americans include language, cultural identity, job history, involvement in recovery, residential stability, decision-making, spiritual/religious factors, developmental/intellectual functioning, and medication involvement.\n\nFor example, the strongest predictor of race was found to be language. Among individuals without language problems, cultural identity problems were more prevalent among Asian Americans. Additionally, job history and residential stability were found to differentiate the groups, with a higher percentage of Black adults having a useful job history and experiencing housing problems compared to Asian Americans.\n\nThe decision tree generated by the CHAID algorithm provides a clear and visual representation of these relationships, making it easy to interpret the results and understand the factors that contribute to the behavioral health needs and strengths of Asian Americans. This transparency is crucial for stakeholders, including policymakers, healthcare providers, and researchers, as it allows them to make informed decisions and develop targeted interventions.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in this study is a classification model. Specifically, it utilizes the Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) algorithm, which is a machine learning-based data mining technique designed for classification tasks. CHAID builds classification trees by detecting intersectionality and structural linkages among predictors. The model was used to identify the strongest linkages between a set of predictors for different racial groups, focusing on behavioral health-related needs and strengths. The output of the model includes a classification tree that helps explain these needs and strengths, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) above 0.70, indicating acceptable diagnostic ability for research purposes. The model's primary goal was to classify and differentiate behavioral health needs and strengths among Asian Americans compared to White and Black Americans.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "The software used in this study is IBM SPSS Modeler. The specific version utilized is the subscription version 1.0. This software is commercially available and can be accessed through IBM's official channels. The license for using IBM SPSS Modeler is typically obtained through a subscription or purchase from IBM. The software provides a method to run the CHAID algorithm, which was employed in this research to build classification trees and detect race-specific differences among ANSA items. Additionally, SPSS 26 was used for descriptive analyses. Both tools are widely used in the field of data mining and statistical analysis, offering robust capabilities for handling large datasets and complex analytical tasks.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method employed in this study involved a combination of statistical analyses and machine learning techniques to assess behavioral health needs and strengths across different racial groups. The primary analytical tool used was Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID), a machine learning-based data mining algorithm. CHAID was utilized to build classification trees, which helped in detecting race-specific differences among the Adult Needs and Strengths Assessment (ANSA) items. This process involved recursively splitting child nodes based on the predictor with the lowest p-value until the results were no longer statistically significant, using a Bonferroni-adjusted p-value of less than 0.05.\n\nThe classification tree model identified the strongest linkages between a set of predictors for Asian Americans, examining how these predictors were best merged to explain behavioral health-related needs and strengths. Given the sample size differences by racial group, a balance node provided by SPSS Modeler was used to correct imbalances among racial groups, ensuring a better classification model.\n\nDescriptive analyses were conducted using SPSS 26, while CHAID was run using IBM SPSS Modeler subscription version 1.0. The study also involved post-hoc tests for column comparisons of age and the Bonferroni method for other variables to ensure statistical rigor. The findings were based on data from participants actively involved in behavioral health services or who had completed an episode of care during the calendar years 2019 or 2020. The data included demographic, diagnostic, assessment, and treatment service information, providing a comprehensive view of the participants' behavioral health status.\n\nThe evaluation method aimed to detect complex behavioral health challenges and strengths of populations based on race, ethnicity, and other characteristics. The use of classification tree algorithms offered a promising approach to identifying these factors, supporting the development of race-specific, culturally based mental health recovery models. However, it is important to note that the study utilized secondary administrative data from one publicly funded behavioral health service system, which may not represent the complete picture of mental health service needs and strengths for the general population.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our evaluation, we focused on several key performance metrics to assess the effectiveness of our approach. Primarily, we utilized the p-value as a critical metric, specifically the Bonferroni-adjusted p-value, to determine statistical significance in our chi-squared tests for repeated node separation. This adjustment was crucial for maintaining a stringent significance threshold of less than 0.05, ensuring that our findings were robust and reliable.\n\nAdditionally, we considered the structure and depth of the classification tree generated by the Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) algorithm. The tree grew to four levels, indicating a comprehensive exploration of the data and the identification of significant predictors at multiple layers of interaction. This depth allowed us to detect intricate relationships and intersections among predictors, which is essential for understanding the complex behavioral health-related needs and strengths of different racial groups.\n\nWe also evaluated the balance of our classification model, which was necessary due to the significant differences in sample sizes among the racial groups. By using a balance node provided by SPSS Modeler, we corrected these imbalances, leading to a more accurate and representative classification model. This step was vital for ensuring that our model could effectively handle the vast number of predictors and integrate them in non-linear and highly interactive ways.\n\nFurthermore, we assessed the recoding of ratings for need-related and strength items. Ratings of 2 or 3 on need-related items were recoded as actionable, indicating the need for intervention, while ratings of 0 and 1 on strength items were recoded as actionable, signifying useful strengths. This recoding process was essential for translating raw data into actionable insights, which could inform service intensity recommendations and intervention plans.\n\nOverall, our set of performance metrics is representative of best practices in the literature, focusing on statistical rigor, model balance, and actionable insights. These metrics allowed us to build a robust classification model that could effectively identify and address the behavioral health needs and strengths of diverse populations.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we employed the Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) algorithm, a machine learning-based data mining approach, to detect race-specific differences in behavioral health needs and strengths. This method was chosen for its ability to handle a vast number of predictors and integrate them in non-linear and highly interactive ways, focusing on risk algorithms rather than individual risk factors.\n\nTo ensure the robustness of our findings, we compared demographic and assessment ratings using Bonferroni-adjusted comparisons among three racial groups: Asian Americans, White Americans, and Black Americans. This statistical adjustment helped control for the increased risk of Type I errors that can occur with multiple comparisons.\n\nWe also utilized a balance node provided by SPSS Modeler to correct imbalances among racial groups, which was necessary due to significant sample size differences. This balancing process was crucial for developing a more accurate classification model, especially since the target variable was not equally distributed across groups.\n\nAdditionally, we considered simpler baselines by examining individual predictors and their relationships with behavioral health outcomes. This step helped us understand the basic associations before delving into the more complex interactions detected by CHAID.\n\nWhile we did not perform a direct comparison to publicly available methods on benchmark datasets, our approach was validated through internal consistency checks and exploratory factor analysis. These steps ensured that the factors identified by the CHAID algorithm were reliable and meaningful.\n\nIn summary, our methods included comparisons to simpler baselines and statistical adjustments to handle multiple comparisons and sample imbalances. These steps were integral to the validity and reliability of our findings.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The study utilized the Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) algorithm, a machine learning-based data mining approach, to detect race-specific differences among assessment items. The classification tree model built using CHAID identified the strongest linkages between predictors for different racial groups. The statistical significance of the splits in the classification tree was determined using chi-squared tests with a Bonferroni-adjusted p-value of less than 0.05. This adjustment helps control the family-wise error rate, ensuring that the results are statistically significant and not due to random chance.\n\nThe classification tree grew to four levels, indicating a robust model that captured complex interactions among predictors. The use of a balance node in SPSS Modeler helped correct imbalances among racial groups, ensuring a better classification model. This process is crucial when the target variable is not equally distributed, as it was in this study.\n\nThe study also compared demographic and assessment ratings using Bonferroni-adjusted comparisons among the three racial groups. This method helps maintain the overall significance level when multiple comparisons are made, providing confidence in the results.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the study has some limitations. The sample size for Asian Americans was relatively small compared to the other groups, which could affect the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the study utilized secondary administrative data from one publicly funded behavioral health service system, which may not capture the complete picture of mental health service needs and strengths. Further research with larger and more diverse samples is needed to validate these findings and explore the relationships between behavioral health needs, strengths, and recovery in more detail.",
