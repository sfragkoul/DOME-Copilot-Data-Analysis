  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was collected from two primary sources. The first set of data was gathered from individuals attending the Department of Orthopedics at Osaka Minami Medical Center (OMMC) between December 22, 2021, and February 21, 2022. A total of 66 patients were enrolled, and 186 walking videos were recorded. These videos were used for model development and internal validation. The second set of data was collected from attendees of the Matsuzaka Health Festival 2023, held in Matsuzaka City on September 10, 2023. This set included 65 walking videos, which were used for external validation of the model.\n\nThe walking videos were recorded using a FLIR CHAMELEON3 camera with specific technical specifications to ensure high-quality capture of lateral movement. Participants were instructed to walk down a designated ten-meter path three times, with the camera positioned four meters away to capture clear footage. Only the walking sequences between the four to seven-meter marks were analyzed to focus on stable walking patterns.\n\nThe dataset has not been used in previous papers or by the community, as this study represents the first application of a deep learning-based computer vision model specifically designed to identify locomotive syndrome (LS). The model's development and validation processes were conducted using prospectively collected data, ensuring the integrity and relevance of the findings. The dataset's unique focus on LS and the use of advanced computer vision techniques make it a valuable contribution to the field of digital health and gait analysis.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset used in this study was divided into three main splits: model creation, internal validation, and external validation. For model creation and internal validation, data was collected from participants at the Department of Orthopedics. A total of 66 patients were enrolled, with two-thirds (approximately 44 participants) assigned to the model development sample and one-third (approximately 22 participants) to the internal validation sample. This resulted in a distribution of 128 walking videos for model creation and 58 walking videos for internal validation.\n\nThe external validation dataset consisted of 65 participants from the Matsuzaka Health Festival 2023, providing an additional 65 walking videos. This external validation was crucial for assessing the model's broader applicability and effectiveness in different settings.\n\nThe model's performance was evaluated using a structured cross-validation methodology, which included three distinct segments: CV1, CV2, and CV3. These segments helped rigorously assess the model\u2019s diagnostic performance, ensuring that the results were robust and reliable. The sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each cross-validation segment, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the model's accuracy in detecting locomotive syndrome (LS).",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets used in this study were carefully split to ensure independence between the training and test sets, which is crucial for the validity of our model's performance evaluation.\n\nFor model development, a total of 66 patients who visited the Department of Orthopedics at Osaka Minami Medical Center (OMMC) were enrolled. These participants were randomly assigned to two groups: two-thirds were allocated to the model development sample, and one-third were assigned to the internal validation sample. This random assignment helped to ensure that the datasets were independent and that the model's performance could be rigorously evaluated.\n\nAdditionally, for external validation, 65 participants from the Matsuzaka Health Festival 2023 were recruited. These participants were entirely separate from those in the model development and internal validation groups, ensuring that the external validation dataset was independent. This external validation step is essential for assessing the model's generalizability and performance in real-world settings.\n\nThe distribution of our datasets compares favorably to previously published machine learning datasets in the field of medical diagnostics. Our approach of using prospectively collected data and ensuring independent datasets for training, internal validation, and external validation aligns with best practices in machine learning and medical research. This methodology helps to mitigate the risk of overfitting and ensures that our model's performance is robust and reliable.\n\nTo enforce the independence of the datasets, we employed strict protocols for data collection and participant selection. Participants were instructed to walk down a designated ten-meter path three times, and only the walking sequences occurring between the four to seven-meter marks were considered for detailed analysis. This standardized approach ensured consistency in the data collected. Furthermore, the use of a specific camera and recording settings helped to maintain uniformity across all videos, reducing variability and enhancing the reliability of our datasets.\n\nIn summary, the datasets were split into independent training, internal validation, and external validation sets through random assignment and strict data collection protocols. This approach ensures that our model's performance is thoroughly evaluated and generalizable to real-world applications.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our study leverages deep learning techniques, specifically focusing on computer vision and pose estimation. The core of our model integrates OpenPose for precise pose estimation from video data and a spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (MS-G3D) for analyzing graph-structured data. This combination is novel in the context of diagnosing locomotive syndrome (LS) and represents a significant advancement in medical diagnostics.\n\nThe algorithm is not entirely new but is innovative in its application to LS detection. OpenPose and MS-G3D have been used in various other contexts, such as analyzing human movement and identifying conditions like Parkinson's disease. However, their integration for LS detection is pioneering. This specific application was not published in a machine-learning journal because the primary focus of our study is on the medical application and diagnostic accuracy of the model rather than the development of new machine-learning algorithms. The emphasis is on the practical implementation and validation of these techniques in a clinical setting to improve the early detection and management of LS.\n\nThe choice of this algorithm was driven by the need for high sensitivity in screening tools, which is crucial for early detection. The model's development and validation processes, including cross-validation and external validation, demonstrated its effectiveness in identifying LS cases with a high degree of accuracy. The results showed that the model outperformed the collective judgment of experienced orthopedic surgeons in terms of sensitivity, making it a valuable tool for early LS detection. However, the model's specificity and negative predictive value (NPV) presented areas for improvement, highlighting the need for further refinement and broader validation across diverse datasets.",
  "optimization/meta": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the data encoding and preprocessing, we utilized a combination of pose estimation and graph-structured data techniques. Specifically, we employed OpenPose to extract key body landmarks from the walking videos, which allowed us to quantify the motor functions of the participants. These landmarks were then structured into a graph format, enabling the application of a spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (MS-G3D). This approach facilitated the analysis of both spatial and temporal dimensions of the gait patterns, which is crucial for identifying subtle indicators of locomotive syndrome (LS).\n\nThe videos were recorded using a FLIR CHAMELEON3 camera with specific technical settings to ensure high-quality capture of lateral movements. Participants walked down a ten-meter path three times, and only the stable walking sequences between the four to seven-meter marks were considered for analysis. This ensured that the data used for training and validation was consistent and focused on the most relevant portions of the gait cycle.\n\nTo handle any technical issues, such as unplayable videos, we ensured that no more than two videos per participant were used as a training dataset. This step was crucial for maintaining the integrity of the data and avoiding any biases that might arise from incomplete or corrupted recordings.\n\nIn summary, the data encoding process involved extracting key body landmarks using OpenPose, structuring these landmarks into a graph format, and applying a spatial-temporal graph convolutional network to analyze the gait patterns. This method allowed for a comprehensive and accurate assessment of the participants' walking patterns, which is essential for the early detection of LS.",

  "optimization/fitting": "The model developed for screening locomotive syndrome (LS) using computer vision involved a deep learning approach with a spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (MS-G3D). The number of parameters in this model is indeed substantial, given the complexity of the neural network architecture used for pose estimation and gait analysis.\n\nTo address the potential issue of overfitting, several strategies were employed. Firstly, cross-validation was utilized during the internal validation phase. This involved dividing the dataset into three segments (CV1, CV2, and CV3) and training the model on different combinations of these segments. This approach helps to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data by evaluating its performance across multiple subsets of the data.\n\nAdditionally, the model's performance was assessed using metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy. The variability in these metrics across the different cross-validation folds provided insights into the model's robustness and its ability to avoid overfitting.\n\nExternal validation was also conducted using an independent dataset from a different clinical setting. This step was crucial for evaluating the model's generalizability and accuracy in a real-world scenario. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated at 0.75, demonstrating the model's predictive accuracy.\n\nTo mitigate underfitting, the model was optimized with a focus on achieving high sensitivity, which is critical for a screening tool aimed at early detection of LS. The sensitivity scores across the cross-validation folds were notably high, indicating that the model effectively identified true positive cases. Furthermore, the model's Positive Predictive Value (PPV) was robust, signifying that the predictions regarding LS presence were generally precise.\n\nIn summary, the combination of cross-validation, external validation, and a focus on key diagnostic metrics helped to ensure that the model neither overfitted nor underfitted the data. This comprehensive approach provided a reliable assessment of the model's performance and its potential for accurate LS screening.",

  "model/interpretability": "The model developed for screening locomotive syndrome (LS) leverages deep learning and computer vision techniques, specifically utilizing pose estimation through OpenPose and a spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (MS-G3D). While these advanced methods provide high diagnostic accuracy, they inherently introduce a level of complexity that can make the model somewhat of a black box. The model's decision-making process is not immediately transparent, as it involves intricate layers of neural networks that process and analyze gait patterns from video data.\n\nHowever, the model's design and validation process offer some insights into its interpretability. The use of pose estimation allows the model to focus on key body landmarks, which are crucial for evaluating motor functions. This approach provides a structured way to understand how the model identifies LS by analyzing specific gait characteristics. For instance, the model can highlight areas where it detects deviations in gait patterns that are indicative of LS, such as changes in posture or movement symmetry.\n\nMoreover, the model's performance metrics, such as sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values, provide a quantitative measure of its effectiveness. The high sensitivity (0.86) indicates that the model is highly effective in identifying true LS cases, which is critical for early detection. The variability in specificity (0.51) suggests areas for improvement in accurately ruling out non-LS cases, but it also points to the model's focus on minimizing false negatives.\n\nThe external validation with an independent dataset further supports the model's generalizability and reliability. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.75 demonstrates the model's reasonable predictive accuracy in distinguishing between LS and non-LS cases. This validation process helps in understanding the model's performance across different clinical settings, enhancing its interpretability and trustworthiness.\n\nIn summary, while the model's deep learning components make it somewhat of a black box, the use of pose estimation and structured validation processes provide valuable insights into its decision-making. The model's focus on key gait characteristics and its performance metrics offer a clearer understanding of how it identifies LS, making it a reliable tool for screening and early detection.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a classification model. It is designed to diagnose locomotive syndrome (LS) by analyzing gait patterns in single-camera video recordings. The model uses pose estimation (OpenPose) and graph-structured data through a spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (MS-G3D) to classify instances into LS and non-LS categories. The diagnostic performance metrics, such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy, indicate its effectiveness in correctly identifying individuals with LS. The model's high sensitivity and PPV highlight its reliability in detecting LS cases, making it a valuable tool for early diagnosis and treatment initiation. However, the model's specificity and NPV suggest areas for improvement, particularly in accurately ruling out non-LS cases. Overall, the model's classification capabilities demonstrate its potential for non-invasive and efficient screening of LS, contributing to better patient outcomes and healthcare delivery.",

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of our method involved a comprehensive process designed to ensure the robustness and generalizability of our model. Initially, we conducted internal validation using a structured cross-validation methodology, which included three distinct segments: CV1, CV2, and CV3. This approach allowed us to rigorously assess the model's diagnostic performance across different subsets of the data. The results from these cross-validation phases provided insights into the model's sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and overall accuracy.\n\nFollowing the internal validation, we proceeded with external validation using an independent dataset. This step was crucial for evaluating the model's performance in a different clinical setting, thereby assessing its generalizability. We constructed a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and calculated the Area Under the Curve (AUC) to provide a detailed assessment of the model's diagnostic performance. The AUC of 0.75 demonstrated the model's predictive accuracy in this external validation.\n\nAdditionally, we compared the diagnostic performance of our deep learning-based model against the collective judgment of six certified orthopedic surgeons with over ten years of clinical experience. Each doctor independently assessed the same video dataset for the presence of locomotive syndrome (LS). This comparison highlighted the strengths and limitations of our model, showing that while our model exhibited higher sensitivity and overall accuracy, it had lower specificity compared to the doctors' assessments. This evaluation underscored the potential of our model to more accurately diagnose LS, despite its tendency for false positives.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation method involved a combination of internal cross-validation, external validation with an independent dataset, and a comparative analysis with expert orthopedic surgeons. This multifaceted approach ensured a thorough assessment of the model's diagnostic performance and its potential for real-world application.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our model, several key performance metrics were reported to provide a comprehensive assessment of its diagnostic capabilities. These metrics include sensitivity, specificity, Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV), and overall accuracy.\n\nSensitivity, which measures the model's ability to correctly identify true positive cases, was a primary focus during the development phase. The model demonstrated high sensitivity across different cross-validation phases, with an average sensitivity of approximately 0.86. This indicates the model's proficiency in accurately detecting individuals with Locomotive Syndrome (LS), which is crucial for early detection and intervention.\n\nSpecificity, which assesses the model's ability to correctly identify true negative cases, showed more variability. The average specificity across the cross-validation phases was 0.51, highlighting the need for improvement in accurately distinguishing individuals without LS. This variability underscores the model's inconsistent performance in identifying true negatives across different datasets.\n\nThe Positive Predictive Value (PPV) was robust, with an average of 0.85. This metric indicates that when the model predicts the presence of LS, it is generally accurate. However, the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) was lower, averaging 0.52, suggesting that the model's ability to rule out non-LS cases is less reliable.\n\nOverall accuracy, which measures the model's ability to correctly classify both LS and non-LS cases, was reported at 0.77. This metric provides a balanced view of the model's performance, confirming its substantial capability in differentiating LS from non-LS conditions accurately.\n\nIn addition to these metrics, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) was calculated during external validation, yielding a value of 0.75. This further confirms the model's reasonable predictive accuracy in distinguishing individuals with and without LS, verifying its effectiveness as a screening tool in various settings.\n\nThe reported metrics are representative of standard performance measures used in the literature for evaluating diagnostic models. Sensitivity and specificity are fundamental metrics that provide insights into the model's ability to correctly identify positive and negative cases. PPV and NPV offer additional context by considering the prevalence of the condition in the population. Overall accuracy provides a single metric that summarizes the model's performance across all classes. The inclusion of the AUC during external validation ensures that the model's performance is assessed in a real-world setting, enhancing the reliability and generalizability of the results.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our evaluation, we conducted a comprehensive comparison of our deep learning-based computer vision model against the collective judgment of six certified orthopedic surgeons. Each doctor, with over ten years of clinical experience, independently assessed the same video dataset for the presence of locomotive syndrome (LS) in an external validation process. This comparison was crucial for evaluating the model's diagnostic performance in a real-world clinical setting.\n\nThe results revealed that our model exhibited a higher sensitivity (89%) compared to the average sensitivity of the doctors (40%). This indicates that our model is more effective in identifying affected patients, which is critical for early detection and treatment. However, the doctors demonstrated greater specificity (77% vs 38%), suggesting that our model has a higher tendency for false positives.\n\nIn terms of predictive values, the model's Positive Predictive Value (PPV) was slightly lower (75% vs 84%) compared to the doctors, but its Negative Predictive Value (NPV) was higher (62% vs 38%). This means that while the model is slightly less precise in confirming LS cases, it is better at ruling out non-LS cases. Overall, the model's accuracy (72%) was higher than that of the doctors (52%), underscoring its potential to more accurately diagnose LS despite its limitation in specificity.\n\nThis comparison highlights the strengths and weaknesses of our model relative to human expertise, providing valuable insights into its practical applicability and areas for improvement. The model's high sensitivity and NPV make it a promising tool for early LS screening, while its lower specificity suggests the need for integration with clinical assessment to minimize false positives.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our model's performance included several key metrics, such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy. These metrics were calculated during both internal and external validation phases.\n\nDuring internal validation, we employed a cross-validation methodology with three distinct segments (CV1, CV2, and CV3). The results showed notable sensitivity across these iterations, with an average sensitivity of approximately 0.86. This indicates the model's proficiency in accurately detecting locomotive syndrome (LS) cases. However, specificity scores exhibited considerable variability, averaging 0.51 across the evaluations. This variability underscores the model's inconsistent ability in identifying true negatives across diverse datasets.\n\nThe PPV recorded robust outcomes, with an aggregate PPV of 0.85. These PPV metrics signify that the model's predictions regarding LS presence are generally precise. However, the NPV presented variability, with an average NPV of 0.52 across the CV phases, reflecting the model\u2019s fluctuating capability in accurately ruling out non-LS cases.\n\nThe accuracy assessments, indicating the model\u2019s overall efficacy in correctly classifying LS and non-LS instances, were documented at 0.82 (CV1), 0.73 (CV2), and 0.77 (CV3), with an overall average accuracy of 0.77.\n\nFor external validation, a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to provide a detailed assessment of the model\u2019s diagnostic performance. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) was calculated at 0.75, demonstrating the model\u2019s predictive accuracy.\n\nStatistical significance was assessed using appropriate tests. For numeric variables, differences in means were evaluated using independent samples t-tests. For categorical variables, Chi-square tests of independence were applied to determine significant associations between groups. These statistical analyses were conducted using Python 3.8 and the SciPy library, ensuring thorough evaluation and interpretation of the data.\n\nThe external validation results, along with the internal validation findings, provide a comprehensive view of the model's performance. The consistency of results between internal and external validations highlights the model\u2019s stable performance across diverse datasets and clinical environments, which is essential for its reliability and broader clinical application.",
