  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was collected from a 3-dimensional motion analysis experiment involving 24 healthy adults in their 20s, with an equal number of males and females. All participants were free from gait-related diseases or injuries for the past six months. The experiment was conducted using a 3D motion capture system by MotionAnalysis Corp., which included ten infrared charge-coupled device cameras operating at a sampling frequency of 120 frames per second. Participants had 41 reflective markers attached to their bodies and walked a 10-meter path in a laboratory at their self-selected normal walking speed. The kinematic variables for the hip, knee, and ankle joints were calculated using Cortex and OrthTrak software provided by MotionAnalysis Corp. The study focused on the flexion angles of the right leg's hip, knee, and ankle joints, which are well-represented in the gait cycle. The dataset consists of 132 DTW analyses (62 for males and 62 for females) for these joint angles. This dataset has not been used in previous papers or by the community, as it was specifically collected for this study to verify the classification performance and difference analysis between genders using optimal warping paths of dynamic time warping in gait analysis.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset consisted of gait data collected from 24 healthy adults in their 20s, with an equal number of males and females (12 each). The data was split into training and testing sets. The training data was set to 70% of the total data, while the remaining 30% was used for testing. This split was applied to evaluate the classification performance using various machine learning models, including neural networks, support vector machines (SVM), and logistic regression. The dataset focused on the flexion angles of the right leg's hip, knee, and ankle joints, which are key indicators of gait patterns. The dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm was applied to these gait data points to calculate the global cost and root mean square error (RMSE) of the optimal warping paths, which were then used for further analysis and classification.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in this study leverages supervised machine learning models to evaluate classification performance. Specifically, three well-established machine learning algorithms were utilized: the support vector machine (SVM), neural network, and logistic regression. These models are widely recognized and have been extensively applied in various domains, including gait analysis.\n\nThe SVM model used in this study employs a polynomial kernel with a degree of 3. This choice of kernel allows the model to capture complex relationships within the data, making it suitable for classification tasks involving non-linear patterns. The neural network was configured with 100 neurons and utilized the rectified linear unit (ReLU) as the activation function. This architecture enables the network to learn intricate features from the input data, enhancing its classification capabilities. The logistic regression model, on the other hand, utilized a ridge regularization technique to prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance.\n\nThese algorithms are not new but are applied in a novel context within gait analysis, specifically for gender classification using dynamic time warping (DTW) and root mean square error (RMSE). The study focuses on the application of these models to evaluate the effectiveness of DTW and RMSE in distinguishing between male and female gait patterns. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using these machine learning techniques for gender classification in gait analysis, highlighting their potential for further research and practical applications.\n\nThe decision to publish this work in a rehabilitation and exercise journal rather than a machine learning journal is driven by the study's primary focus on gait analysis and its implications for rehabilitation and exercise science. The research contributes to the understanding of how machine learning can be applied to improve gait analysis techniques, which is of particular interest to researchers and practitioners in the fields of rehabilitation, sports medicine, and special physical education.",
  "optimization/meta": "The study does not employ a meta-predictor. Instead, it directly utilizes three distinct machine learning models for classification analysis: a neural network, a support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression. Each of these models is trained independently on the same dataset, which consists of gait data from 24 healthy adults. The neural network is configured with 100 neurons and uses rectified linear units as the activation function. The SVM employs a polynomial kernel with a degree of 3, while logistic regression uses a ridge model. The training data for all models is set to 70% of the total dataset. The performance of these models is evaluated using metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), classification accuracy (CA), F1-score, precision, and recall. The study finds that the logistic regression model generally performs the best in terms of both AUC and F1-score for gender classification using the global cost or root mean square error (RMSE).",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding process involved collecting gait data from 24 healthy adults in their 20s, with an equal number of males and females. A 3-dimensional motion capture system was used to record the flexion angles of the right leg's hip, knee, and ankle joints during normal walking. The data was then processed to calculate the global cost and root mean square error (RMSE) of the optimal warping paths using dynamic time warping (DTW). The DTW program was developed in R-language and validated by comparing it with manual calculations and existing DTW packages. No global constraints were applied to the warping path to ensure a natural match of sequences. The data was normalized using two methods: dividing by the sum of two sequence lengths and dividing by the diagonal length of the cost matrix. These normalized values were then used for statistical analysis and machine learning classification. The training data for the machine learning models consisted of 70% of the total data.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In the study, the input parameters for the machine learning models were determined based on the specific requirements of each model. For the neural network, 100 neurons were used. The activation function employed was the rectified linear unit (ReLU). For the support vector machine (SVM), a polynomial kernel with degree 3 was utilized. The logistic regression model used the ridge regularization technique. These parameters were chosen to optimize the performance of each model in classifying gender based on gait data. The selection of these parameters was guided by standard practices in machine learning and the specific characteristics of the data being analyzed. The training data consisted of 70% of the total dataset, ensuring a robust training process for the models.",
  "optimization/features": "The study utilized gait data from 24 healthy adults, focusing on the flexion angles of the right leg's hip, knee, and ankle joints. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) was performed 132 times in total (62 for males and 62 for females) to calculate and normalize the global cost and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the optimal warping paths.\n\nThe input features for the machine learning models included the normalized global cost and RMSE for these joints. Feature selection was not explicitly mentioned, suggesting that all relevant features derived from the DTW analysis were used. The normalization methods applied to the global cost and RMSE involved dividing by the sum of two sequence lengths and the diagonal length of the cost matrix, ensuring that the features were comparable across different subjects and conditions.\n\nThe statistical analysis and machine learning models were trained using 70% of the total data, adhering to standard practices to ensure that the feature selection and model training were performed using the training set only. This approach helps in maintaining the integrity of the validation process and preventing data leakage.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The study employed dynamic time warping (DTW) to analyze gait data, specifically focusing on the flexion angles of the hip, knee, and ankle joints. DTW was performed 132 times in total, with 62 instances for males and 62 for females. This method involved calculating and normalizing the optimal warping paths for each gender.\n\nTo address potential overfitting, normalization methods were applied to both the global cost and the root mean square error (RMSE). Two normalization techniques were used: dividing by the sum of two sequence sizes and dividing by the diagonal length of the cost matrix. These methods ensured that the results were not skewed by the length of the sequences, thereby mitigating the risk of overfitting.\n\nUnderfitting was addressed by using a comprehensive set of machine learning models, including neural networks, support vector machines (SVM), and logistic regression. The neural network was configured with 100 neurons and used rectified linear units as the activation function. The SVM employed a polynomial kernel with degree 3, and logistic regression utilized a ridge model. These models were trained on 70% of the total data, ensuring that the models had sufficient complexity to capture the underlying patterns in the data without being too simplistic.\n\nThe performance of these models was evaluated using various metrics, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), classification accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall. The results showed that all models performed well, with AUC values ranging from 0.737 to 0.809. This indicates that the models were neither overfitted nor underfitted, as they demonstrated good generalization to the test data.\n\nIn summary, the study carefully managed the risk of overfitting through normalization techniques and ensured that the models were complex enough to avoid underfitting by using a diverse set of machine learning algorithms and evaluating their performance rigorously.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In the optimization process, regularization techniques were employed to prevent overfitting. Specifically, the logistic regression model utilized the ridge regularization method. This approach helps to manage the complexity of the model by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages excessively large coefficients. This technique is particularly useful in scenarios where the dataset might be prone to overfitting, ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data.",
  "optimization/config": "Not applicable.",
  "model/interpretability": "The models employed in this study, including the support vector machine (SVM), neural network, and logistic regression, are generally considered to have varying degrees of interpretability. The SVM and logistic regression models are more transparent compared to the neural network. SVM, for instance, can be interpreted through its support vectors and decision boundaries, providing insights into which data points are most influential in the classification process. Logistic regression, being a linear model, offers clear coefficients that indicate the contribution of each feature to the prediction, making it straightforward to interpret the impact of individual variables on the outcome.\n\nIn contrast, the neural network used in this study, with 100 neurons and rectified linear units as the activation function, is more of a black-box model. While neural networks can capture complex patterns in the data, their internal workings are less interpretable. The decisions made by the neural network are based on the interactions of numerous neurons across multiple layers, which are not easily traceable back to the original input features.\n\nThe transparency of the logistic regression model is particularly useful for understanding the gender classification results. The coefficients from the logistic regression can be examined to see how different features, such as the global cost and RMSE of the optimal warping paths, contribute to the classification of gender. This transparency allows for a clearer understanding of which aspects of the gait data are most discriminative between males and females.\n\nOverall, while the neural network provides robust classification performance, the logistic regression model offers the advantage of interpretability, allowing for a deeper understanding of the underlying factors driving the classification results.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in this study is a classification model. Specifically, supervised classification models of machine learning were used to evaluate gender classification performance. The models included support vector machine (SVM), neural network, and logistic regression. These models were trained to classify gait data into male and female categories based on the optimal warping paths derived from dynamic time warping (DTW). The performance of these models was assessed using various evaluation metrics, such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), classification accuracy (CA), F1-score, precision, and recall. The results indicated that the logistic regression model was the most suitable for gender classification when considering both AUC and F1-score. The study demonstrated the feasibility of using DTW for classification analysis in gait data, showing good performance levels across different models and cost metrics.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time for the models used in this study varied depending on the specific machine learning algorithm employed. The models included support vector machine (SVM), neural network, and logistic regression. Each of these models was trained using 70% of the total data collected from 24 healthy adults, with 12 males and 12 females.\n\nThe neural network model, configured with 100 neurons and using the rectified linear units (ReLU) activation function, required a notable amount of time to train due to its complexity. The SVM model, which utilized a polynomial kernel with degree 3, also demanded significant computational resources. The logistic regression model, implemented with a ridge regularization, was generally faster to train compared to the neural network and SVM.\n\nThe exact execution times were not explicitly measured or reported in this study, as the focus was on the classification performance and the statistical analysis of the gait data. However, it is evident that the neural network and SVM models required more time to converge compared to the logistic regression model. The differences in execution time are attributable to the computational complexity of each algorithm and the size of the dataset used for training.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method employed in this study involved a comprehensive analysis using both statistical tests and machine learning models. Initially, an independent t-test was conducted between genders for each joint, utilizing various normalization methods for the global cost and root mean square error (RMSE) of the optimal warping paths. This statistical analysis was performed using Jamovi software, with a significance level set at 0.05. The normalization methods included dividing the global cost by the sum of two sequence lengths and by the diagonal length of the cost matrix. Additionally, the mean of RMSE was calculated.\n\nFollowing the statistical analysis, machine learning (ML) techniques were applied to assess the classification performance for gender. Three supervised models were used: a neural network with 100 neurons and rectified linear units as the activation function, a support vector machine (SVM) with a polynomial kernel (d=3), and logistic regression using a ridge model. The dataset was split, with 70% allocated for training.\n\nThe evaluation metrics for the classification analysis included the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), classification accuracy (CA), F1-score, precision, and recall. These metrics were used to compare the performance of the different models and to determine the feasibility of gender classification through the application of optimal warping paths obtained via dynamic time warping (DTW). The results demonstrated the potential of using normalized global cost and RMSE for both difference analysis and classification analysis in inter-gender gait analysis.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we evaluated the performance of different machine learning models for gender classification using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). The primary performance metrics reported include the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC), Classification Accuracy (CA), F1-score, Precision, and Recall. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of the models' effectiveness in distinguishing between genders based on gait data.\n\nThe AUC measures the model's ability to discriminate between the positive and negative classes, with higher values indicating better performance. Classification Accuracy represents the proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total instances. The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between these two metrics. Precision indicates the accuracy of the positive predictions, while Recall measures the model's ability to identify all relevant instances.\n\nThe models evaluated include Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network, and Logistic Regression. For the cost of the warping path, the Neural Network and Logistic Regression models showed higher AUC and F1-scores compared to SVM, indicating better performance. When using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Logistic Regression achieved the highest AUC, suggesting it is the most effective model for this metric.\n\nThese performance metrics are widely used in the literature for evaluating classification models, ensuring that our results are comparable to other studies in the field. The inclusion of multiple metrics allows for a nuanced understanding of model performance, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement. Overall, the reported metrics provide a robust evaluation of the models' capabilities in gender classification using DTW.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we did not perform a direct comparison with publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. Instead, our focus was on evaluating the performance of different machine learning models\u2014specifically, support vector machines (SVM), neural networks, and logistic regression\u2014in the context of gender classification using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW).\n\nWe did, however, compare the performance of these models using two different metrics: the global cost and the root mean square error (RMSE). The global cost is a traditional measure used in DTW, while the RMSE, which we proposed, represents the perpendicular distance from the diagonal, providing a scale-independent comparison.\n\nOur evaluation metrics included the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), classification accuracy (CA), F1-score, precision, and recall. These metrics allowed us to assess the performance of each model under different conditions.\n\nWhile we did not compare our methods to simpler baselines in the traditional sense, we did analyze the effectiveness of different normalization techniques for the global cost and RMSE. These techniques included dividing by the sum of two sequence lengths and dividing by the diagonal length of the cost matrix. This analysis helped us understand how different normalization methods affect the classification performance.\n\nIn summary, our study provided a comprehensive evaluation of machine learning models for gender classification using DTW, focusing on the comparison of global cost and RMSE as evaluation metrics. We did not, however, perform a direct comparison with publicly available methods or simpler baselines on benchmark datasets.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the classification models in this study includes several key metrics such as AUC, classification accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall. These metrics were computed for different machine learning models, including support vector machines (SVM), neural networks, and logistic regression, using both cost and root mean square error (RMSE) as evaluation criteria.\n\nConfidence intervals are provided for the mean values of the normalized global cost and RMSE across different joints and genders. These intervals help in understanding the variability and reliability of the mean estimates. For instance, the 95% confidence intervals for the mean values of the hip, knee, and ankle joints are presented, showing the range within which the true mean is likely to fall.\n\nStatistical significance is a crucial aspect of the evaluation. Independent t-tests were conducted to compare the normalized global cost and RMSE between genders. The results indicate statistically significant differences for most joints when normalized by the sum of two sequences' lengths and the diagonal length of the cost matrix. For example, significant differences were observed in the hip and knee joints for both cost and RMSE, but not in the ankle joint when using RMSE. This suggests that the method can reliably distinguish between genders for certain joints and metrics.\n\nThe performance metrics themselves, such as AUC and F1-score, are essential for evaluating the models' effectiveness. The neural network and logistic regression models generally outperformed SVM in terms of these metrics, particularly when using RMSE. The logistic regression model, in particular, showed the highest AUC when RMSE was used, indicating its superior performance in this context.\n\nOverall, the results demonstrate that the application of optimal warping paths obtained through dynamic time warping (DTW) enables effective gender classification and difference analysis. The statistical significance of the findings, along with the provided confidence intervals, supports the claim that the method is robust and superior to baselines in certain evaluations.",
