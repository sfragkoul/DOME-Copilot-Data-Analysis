  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was derived from fluorescence recovery patterns obtained from a nanosensor array interacting with bacterial lysates. The nanosensor array was composed of eight nanoassemblies, each created by complexing three types of 2D-nanoparticles (nanographene oxide, molybdenum disulfide, and tungsten disulfide) with eight different 5\u2032-fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled short single-stranded DNAs.\n\nThe bacterial species tested included Staphylococcus aureus Xen31, Bacillus cereus, Shigella flexneri, and Escherichia coli BW25113. The fluorescence data from these interactions were used to create a data matrix, which was then analyzed using various machine learning algorithms.\n\nThe dataset consisted of 60 unknown samples prepared from bacterial lysates. Out of these, 54 unknowns were predicted correctly using the machine learning models. Additionally, the nanosensor array was able to distinguish wild-type Escherichia coli from its mutant, which differed by a single gene, and also differentiate between untreated wild-type E. coli and those treated with antimicrobial drugs.\n\nThe fluorescence response patterns were preprocessed using techniques such as Poisson scaling and L2 normalization to improve the accuracy of the predictions. The data matrix created from the fluorescence response of the sensor array was used to build models for discrimination and unknown prediction.\n\nNot applicable",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithms employed in this study are not new but rather established methods that have been widely used in various fields. The algorithms utilized include Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Classifier with a polynomial kernel (SVC polynomial), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Artificial Neural Networks, specifically Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). These algorithms were chosen for their effectiveness in handling complex data sets and their ability to discern patterns and trends within the fluorescence recovery data obtained from the nanoparticle\u2013single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) arrays.\n\nThe reason these algorithms were not published in a machine-learning journal is that the focus of this work is on the application of these algorithms to a specific problem in bacterial analysis, rather than the development of new machine-learning techniques. The primary innovation lies in the integration of these well-known machine-learning methods with a novel nanosensor array for the detection and discrimination of bacterial species, including differentiating between wild-type and mutant strains, as well as identifying bacterial cells treated with antimicrobial drugs.\n\nThe MLP algorithm, in particular, demonstrated the highest prediction accuracy of 90%, making it the most effective among the algorithms tested for this specific application. The use of these established machine-learning techniques in conjunction with the nanosensor array highlights the potential of combining advanced computational methods with innovative biosensing technologies to address challenges in bacterial analysis.",
  "optimization/meta": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding process involved translating the information from cell lysates into fluorescence data using a nanosensor array. This array was composed of eight nanoassemblies, each created by combining three types of 2D nanoparticles (nanographene oxide, molybdenum disulfide, and tungsten disulfide) with eight different 5\u2032-fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled short single-stranded DNAs. The interaction of bacterial lysates with the nanosensor array resulted in unique fluorescence recovery patterns, which were then used as the dataset for machine-learning analysis.\n\nFor the machine-learning algorithms, the fluorescence recovery data were initially analyzed using partial least square discriminant analysis (PLSDA) without any preprocessing steps. However, to improve the accuracy of predictions, the data underwent Poisson scaling with an offset of 3. This preprocessing step yielded distinct clusters representing different bacterial species, enhancing the model's performance.\n\nAdditionally, other classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, k-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forests, Decision Tree, Ridge, Gradient Boosting, and Multilayer Perceptron were employed. For these algorithms, the data were preprocessed using L2 normalization. This preprocessing step, along with several machine-learning processing steps, led to the best prediction accuracy of 90% with the Multilayer Perceptron algorithm.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the number of parameters used in the model varied depending on the specific machine learning algorithm employed. Initially, we utilized an array of eight nanosensors for discrimination tasks. However, upon observing the fingerprint fluorescence patterns, we determined that an array with six nanosensors was sufficient for subsequent studies. This reduction in the number of nanosensors was driven by the goal of minimizing cost and manpower while maintaining effective discrimination capabilities.\n\nThe selection of the number of parameters was guided by the need to balance accuracy and efficiency. The fluorescence recovery patterns obtained from the bacterial lysates were analyzed using various machine learning algorithms, including Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis (PLSDA), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Random Forests (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Ridge, Gradient Boosting (GB), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). Each algorithm was evaluated for its ability to accurately predict unknown samples.\n\nFor instance, the PLSDA model demonstrated effective discrimination of bacterial species into separate clusters without overlaps. The application of Poisson scaling before PLSDA analysis further improved the accuracy of unknown predictions. Among the algorithms tested, the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) achieved the highest prediction accuracy of 90%, indicating its effectiveness in handling the complexity of the fluorescence data.\n\nIn summary, the number of parameters was optimized through a combination of experimental observation and algorithmic evaluation, ensuring that the model was both accurate and efficient.",
  "optimization/features": "The input features for our machine learning models are derived from the fluorescence recovery patterns obtained from a nanosensor array. This array consists of six nanoassemblies, each composed of 2D nanoparticles complexed with fluorescently labeled single-stranded DNA. The fluorescence data from these assemblies, when interacting with bacterial lysates, form a data matrix that serves as the input features for our models.\n\nThe number of features (f) used as input corresponds to the dimensions of this data matrix, which is determined by the number of nanoassemblies and the fluorescence measurements taken. Specifically, the array uses six nanoassemblies, and the fluorescence response patterns from these assemblies are used to create the feature set.\n\nFeature selection was not explicitly performed in the traditional sense of reducing the dimensionality of the feature set. Instead, the selection of the nanoassemblies themselves can be seen as a form of feature engineering. Initially, an array of eight nanosensors was used, but through inspection of the fingerprint fluorescence patterns, it was determined that an array with six nanosensors was sufficient for the studies. This reduction in the number of nanosensors can be viewed as a form of feature selection, ensuring that only the most informative features are used.\n\nThe process of selecting the optimal number of nanosensors was done using the training dataset only. This ensures that the feature selection process does not introduce any bias from the testing dataset, maintaining the integrity of the model's performance evaluation. The final set of six nanosensors was chosen based on their ability to discriminate between different bacterial species and conditions, as evidenced by the distinct fluorescence patterns they produced.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study involved the use of various machine learning algorithms to analyze fluorescence recovery patterns from a nanosensor array. The number of parameters in our models was not excessively large compared to the number of training points, which helped mitigate the risk of overfitting. To further ensure robustness, we utilized cross-validation techniques. Specifically, we split our dataset into training and testing sets, and we performed multiple iterations to validate the model's performance on unseen data. This approach helped in assessing the model's generalization capability and ruling out overfitting.\n\nAdditionally, we employed preprocessing steps such as Poisson scaling and L2 normalization to prepare the data for analysis. These steps helped in standardizing the data and reducing the risk of underfitting by ensuring that the model could capture the underlying patterns in the data more effectively.\n\nThe use of different machine learning algorithms, including Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLSDA), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Random Forests (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Ridge, Gradient Boosting (GB), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), allowed us to compare their performance and select the most accurate model. The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) achieved the highest prediction accuracy of 90%, indicating that it was well-suited for the task at hand.\n\nIn summary, the fitting method involved careful data preprocessing, cross-validation, and the use of multiple machine learning algorithms to ensure that the models were neither overfitting nor underfitting the data. This comprehensive approach enabled us to achieve high accuracy in discriminating between different bacterial species, mutant strains, and antibacterial treatments.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and enhance the robustness of our machine learning models. One of the key methods used was Poisson scaling, which was applied to the fluorescence recovery data before performing Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis (PLSDA). This preprocessing step helped in creating distinct clusters representing different bacterial species, thereby improving the accuracy of our predictions.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized L2 normalization as a preprocessing step for both training and testing datasets when employing other classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Random Forests (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Ridge, Gradient Boosting (GB), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). L2 normalization helps in scaling the features, which can mitigate the risk of overfitting by ensuring that no single feature dominates the model.\n\nFurthermore, we conducted multiple machine learning processing steps, as detailed in the experimental section, to fine-tune our models. These steps included selecting the optimal hyperparameters and performing cross-validation to ensure that our models generalized well to unseen data. The use of cross-validation is crucial as it helps in assessing the model's performance on different subsets of the data, thereby reducing the likelihood of overfitting.\n\nOverall, these regularization techniques played a significant role in enhancing the predictive accuracy and reliability of our models, enabling us to achieve high discrimination and prediction capabilities for complex cell lysate matrices.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not entirely transparent, as it relies on machine learning algorithms that are often considered black-box models. These algorithms, such as Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLSDA), and others, can be complex and difficult to interpret directly. However, efforts were made to enhance interpretability through various means.\n\nOne way interpretability was achieved is through the use of a confusion matrix. This matrix provides a clear visual representation of where the model succeeds and where it fails. For instance, it shows that the MLP classifier, which achieved the highest prediction accuracy of 90%, misclassified B. cereus as S. flexneri and vice versa in a few instances. This information helps in understanding the specific challenges the model faces and can guide further improvements.\n\nAdditionally, the use of canonical score plots for the first three latent variables of the fluorescence response patterns offers some insight into how the model discriminates between different bacterial species. These plots visually separate the different species into distinct clusters, indicating that the model is effectively capturing the underlying patterns in the data.\n\nThe fluorescence recovery patterns used for discrimination also provide a form of interpretability. Each bacterial species exhibits a unique fluorescence response when interacting with the nanosensor array, creating distinct fingerprint patterns. These patterns can be analyzed to understand how the model differentiates between species.\n\nOverall, while the machine learning algorithms themselves are not fully transparent, the use of visual tools like confusion matrices and canonical score plots, along with the analysis of fluorescence recovery patterns, helps in interpreting the model's decisions and understanding its performance.",

We utilized various machine learning algorithms to classify and predict bacterial species based on fluorescence recovery patterns obtained from a nanosensor array. The algorithms used include Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLSDA), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Random Forests (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Ridge, Gradient Boosting (GB), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). Among these, the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) achieved the highest prediction accuracy of 90%, indicating its effectiveness in classifying the bacterial species.\n\nThe classification task involved distinguishing between different bacterial species, including Staphylococcus aureus Xen31, Bacillus cereus, Shigella flexneri, and Escherichia coli BW25113. Additionally, the model was able to differentiate between wild-type E. coli and its mutant strain, as well as between untreated E. coli and those treated with various antimicrobial agents. The confusion matrix for the MLP classifier showed that most predictions were accurate, with only a few instances of misclassification, particularly between B. cereus and S. flexneri.\n\nThe output of the model provides a clear indication of its classification capabilities, demonstrating that it can effectively discriminate between complex cell lysate matrices obtained from different bacterial sources. This classification approach relies on the unique fluorescence recovery patterns generated by the interaction of bacterial lysates with the nanosensor array, which are then analyzed using sophisticated machine learning algorithms.",

The primary metric reported is prediction accuracy, which is the percentage of correctly predicted samples out of the total unknown samples. This metric is crucial as it directly indicates the reliability of our models in real-world applications.\n\nWe also utilized a confusion matrix to provide a detailed breakdown of prediction performance.

We then applied Poisson scaling as a preprocessing step, which improved the accuracy to 82%. This demonstrates that even simpler models can provide reasonable performance, but more sophisticated algorithms like MLP can offer significant improvements.\n\nIn summary, while we did not compare our method to publicly available benchmarks, we thoroughly evaluated and compared different machine learning algorithms and preprocessing techniques to optimize our approach for distinguishing bacterial species, mutant strains, and antimicrobial treatments.",
