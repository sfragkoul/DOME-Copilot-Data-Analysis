  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in our study consists of biological images of C. elegans, specifically from 96-well plates. These images are inherently challenging due to high variation in illumination and contrast, as well as complicated occlusions and deformations of the objects to be classified. The goal is to label each pixel in the image as one of four classes: adult worm, larva, egg/embryo, or background. The images contain a mix of adults, larvae, and eggs, and the pixel area of each developmental stage can be used to calculate a quantitative measure of lethality in a mixed population.\n\nThe dataset is not explicitly quantified in terms of the number of data points, but it is sufficient to evaluate the performance of our DevStaR system. The performance was assessed by comparing pixel values labeled by the algorithm with manual coloring of objects by a human expert for the same set of images. This comparison helps in understanding the object recognition error of DevStaR, although it does not represent a direct comparison with typical results of human scoring.\n\nThe images used in our study are from a functioning C. elegans laboratory, indicating that the data is relevant and applicable to real-world scenarios. The algorithm has been demonstrated to clearly distinguish between groups of images with differing levels of lethality, and it is being applied to assess data from high-throughput RNA interference (RNAi) screens. This suggests that the dataset is not only used in our current study but also has the potential to be used in future research and by the community for similar analyses.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our work leverages a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for generating scores for object categorization. SVMs are a well-established class of machine-learning algorithms known for their effectiveness in classification tasks, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional spaces.\n\nThe SVM used in our approach is not a novel algorithm but rather a tried-and-tested method that has been extensively used in various applications. The reason it was not published in a machine-learning journal is that our primary focus is on the application of this algorithm within the context of biological image analysis, specifically for developmental stage recognition in C. elegans. The innovation lies in how we integrate the SVM with other techniques, such as the min-cut algorithm and hierarchical grouping mechanisms, to address the unique challenges posed by biological images.\n\nOur contribution is not in the development of a new machine-learning algorithm but in the novel application and combination of existing methods to solve a specific problem in biological imaging. This approach allows us to handle complex scenarios involving overlapping, occlusions, and clutter, which are common in biological images. By using the SVM to generate scores and then applying a min-cut algorithm to resolve ambiguities based on the proximity of object parts, we achieve a robust and accurate labeling system. This integration of different techniques is what sets our work apart and makes it suitable for publication in a computer vision and pattern recognition journal.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model described in our work does not operate as a traditional meta-predictor. Instead, it follows a hierarchical principle where each layer consists of units that evaluate and group information to resolve ambiguities in label scores. The evaluation functions within these layers can utilize either model-based or learning (discriminative) methods to output label scores. This approach allows for a flexible combination of methods tailored to the specific nature of the sub-problems at different layers.\n\nThe grouping mechanisms applied in our model do not rely on data from other machine-learning algorithms as input in the typical sense of a meta-predictor. Rather, they use local geometrical and topological constraints to organize the scores produced by the evaluation functions. These constraints help eliminate ambiguities in the label scores, producing coherent structures without the need for external machine-learning data.\n\nThe training data for our model is designed to be independent at each layer. The output of one layer serves as the input for the next, ensuring that the grouping and evaluation processes are self-contained within the hierarchy. This independence is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the hierarchical principle, as it allows each layer to focus on resolving ambiguities specific to its level of abstraction.\n\nIn summary, while our model incorporates elements of both discriminative and model-based methods, it does not function as a meta-predictor in the conventional sense. The hierarchical structure and the use of grouping mechanisms ensure that the training data remains independent and tailored to the specific challenges at each layer.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our approach, data encoding and preprocessing were crucial steps to ensure effective object categorization. We began by representing objects using a tree graph, where the branches and bifurcations became edges linking object parts. This tree graph, denoted as GTop(v, e), where v represents parts of an object and e represents edges connecting adjacent object parts, served as a natural representation for the object categorization process.\n\nTo handle shapes with multiple boundary contours, which often occur due to overlaps or deformations, we employed a novel solution. We selected a point in each boundary contour and applied a \"topological surgery\" to link these points, creating a single, unique boundary shape. This process involved using a greedy method to select the closest pair of points in Euclidean distance, with one point on the internal contour and the other on the outline. The dynamic programming algorithm was then applied to this new boundary shape.\n\nFor object part labeling and deconstruction, we focused on categorizing objects into four labels: \"worm,\" \"egg clump,\" \"egg,\" or \"larva.\" Given the complexity of overlapping objects, we needed to label object parts first and then group these parts to produce final object labels. The units in our graph GTop(v, e) were the nodes, and we aimed to produce scores for the four categories.\n\nWe extracted 13 features for each object part, including area, length of the symmetry axis, length of the boundary contour, and changes in width at different scales. These features helped distinguish between different object categories, particularly for large objects like worms and egg clumps, which are characterized by their thickness, elongation, size, and boundary contour smoothness.\n\nAn SVM learning method was trained using approximately 2000 examples to assign scores to each category. The SVM output provided a score for each category, with the magnitude of the score indicating the confidence of the label assignment. To resolve score ambiguities, we used the proximity of object parts in the tree graph. The min-cut algorithm was applied with edge weights determined from the SVM output and proximity in the tree graph, significantly improving our results.\n\nIn summary, our data encoding involved creating a tree graph representation of objects, handling multiple boundary contours through topological surgery, and extracting relevant features for SVM-based categorization. This preprocessing ensured that our machine-learning algorithm could effectively categorize objects in complex biological images.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In the optimization process of our model, we primarily focus on a few key parameters that control the behavior and performance of our algorithms. One crucial parameter is the one that regulates the creation of branches in the tree graph representation of objects. This parameter is set to ensure that the algorithm does not generate excessive branches due to minor shape variations, thereby maintaining robustness across different images. We set this parameter once for all images, which simplifies the process and ensures consistency.\n\nAdditionally, we use an empirically optimized edge weight, denoted as \u03bc, in the min-cut algorithm. This weight encourages neighboring pixels to adopt the same label, which is essential for accurate segmentation. The value of \u03bc is determined through extensive testing and optimization to achieve the best possible segmentation results.\n\nThe number of features extracted for each object part is another important parameter. We extract a total of 13 features, including area, length of the symmetry axis, length of the boundary contour, and changes in width at different scales. These features are used as input for the Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning method, which assigns scores to different object categories.\n\nThe selection of these parameters was based on a combination of theoretical considerations and empirical testing. We aimed to balance the complexity of the model with its performance, ensuring that it could handle a variety of images and object categories effectively. The parameters were tuned to optimize the segmentation and labeling of objects, including worms, egg clumps, eggs, and larvae.",
  "optimization/features": "The input features used in our approach are derived from the characteristics of object parts, specifically focusing on large objects for categorization. We extracted a total of 13 features for each object part. These features include area, length of the symmetry axis, length of the boundary contour, and changes in width at different scales. Additionally, we consider the sum of the number of times the width changes sign, which helps in distinguishing between smooth and bumpy boundary contours.\n\nFeature selection was not explicitly performed in the traditional sense. Instead, we carefully chose features based on empirical observations and the known distinguishing characteristics of the objects we aimed to categorize. This selection process was informed by examining numerous examples of worms and egg clumps, focusing on attributes such as thickness, elongation, size, and boundary contour smoothness.\n\nThe features were selected based on a comprehensive analysis of the objects' properties, ensuring that they captured the essential differences between the categories. This methodical approach allowed us to derive a robust set of features without the need for additional feature selection techniques. The learning procedure, specifically the Support Vector Machine (SVM), was then trained using approximately 2000 examples to assign scores to each category, providing a reliable basis for object categorization.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in our approach is designed to be robust and efficient, with a focus on minimizing overfitting and underfitting.\n\nThe number of parameters in our model is not excessively large compared to the number of training points. We utilize a Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning method, which is known for its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces and its ability to handle a large number of features without overfitting. The SVM was trained using approximately 2000 examples, which provided a sufficient number of training points to ensure robust learning.\n\nTo rule out overfitting, we employed a single parameter that controls the creation of branches in the tree structure. This parameter was set once for all images, ensuring consistency and preventing the model from becoming too complex. Additionally, the use of a greedy method to select the closest pair of points for topological surgery further simplifies the model, reducing the risk of overfitting.\n\nUnderfitting was addressed by carefully selecting relevant features for the SVM. We extracted 13 features for each object part, including area, length of the symmetry axis, length of the boundary contour, and changes in width at different scales. These features were chosen based on their ability to distinguish between different object categories, such as worms, egg clumps, eggs, and larvae. The SVM's ability to assign scores to each category and the use of a min-cut algorithm to group object parts helped to ensure that the model captured the necessary complexity of the data without being too simplistic.\n\nOverall, the fitting method strikes a balance between complexity and simplicity, utilizing a limited number of parameters and features to achieve accurate object categorization while avoiding overfitting and underfitting.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our approach, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure robust performance across various images. One key method involved the use of a min-cut algorithm, which helps in segmenting objects by considering local illumination variations. This algorithm assigns weights to edges based on the median value of energies within connected components, making it adaptive to different images and reducing the risk of overfitting to specific illumination conditions.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized a support vector machine (SVM) for categorizing object parts. The SVM was trained on a large dataset of approximately 2000 examples, which helped in generalizing the model and preventing overfitting. The SVM assigns scores to different categories, and the magnitude of these scores indicates the confidence of the classification. This scoring mechanism, combined with the proximity information from the tree graph, allows for a more accurate and robust labeling of object parts.\n\nFurthermore, we applied dynamic programming algorithms to find the optimal symmetry pairing and grouping of object parts. These algorithms consider both the symmetry scores and the penalty for the number of object parts created, ensuring that the model does not overfit to specific shapes or configurations.\n\nOverall, these techniques collectively contribute to the robustness of our method, enabling it to handle variations in illumination, occlusions, and deformations in biological images effectively.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model we propose is not a black box but rather a transparent and interpretable system. Our approach, known as the Hierarchical Principle (HP), is designed to be clear and understandable at each layer of the hierarchy. Each layer consists of units that evaluate and group based on specific functions, making the decision-making process explicit.\n\nThe evaluation functions within each layer can use either model-based or learning (discriminative) methods to output label scores. These methods are well-documented and understood in the field of computer vision. For instance, we use the min cut algorithm as a grouping mechanism to resolve ambiguities in object labels. This algorithm is a well-established technique in computer vision and is used to ensure that neighboring units are constrained to take similar labels, thereby producing coherent structures.\n\nThe grouping mechanisms apply local geometrical and topological constraints, which are intuitive and easy to interpret. These constraints help in organizing the scores and eliminating ambiguities, making the final output more reliable and understandable. For example, in our system, the symmetry axis and tree structures are used to represent object parts and their relationships, providing a clear visual and structural interpretation of the data.\n\nMoreover, our system includes a visual representation of the decision-making process. Figures such as the architecture of the four-layer machine and the identification of the well area demonstrate how the model processes images and resolves ambiguities. These visual aids make it easier to understand how the model arrives at its conclusions, enhancing its transparency.\n\nIn summary, our model is designed to be interpretable and transparent. The use of well-known algorithms, clear evaluation and grouping mechanisms, and visual representations of the decision-making process ensure that the model's operations are understandable and verifiable.",
  "model/output": "The model described in this publication is primarily focused on object recognition and categorization, which falls under the classification type of machine learning models. It is designed to label objects or parts of objects into predefined categories such as \"worm,\" \"egg clump,\" \"egg,\" or \"larva.\"\n\nThe model operates through a hierarchical principle, where each layer consists of units that evaluate and score potential labels for object parts. These scores are then processed through a grouping mechanism to resolve ambiguities and produce coherent structures. The grouping mechanism ensures that neighboring units are constrained to take similar labels, thereby eliminating ambiguities in the label scores assigned to the units.\n\nOne of the key contributions of the model is the use of a min-cut algorithm as a grouping mechanism. This algorithm helps to resolve object label ambiguities left by the scores generated by the learning machine. The min-cut algorithm is applied to a tree graph representation of the object parts, where edges store object part information. This tree graph, referred to as GTop(v, e), is a natural representation for the object categorization process.\n\nThe final output of the model is a set of category labels for the object parts, which are then grouped to produce the final object labels. For example, the model can clearly separate an egg clump from an adult worm, as illustrated in the final results after applying the min-cut algorithm.\n\nIn summary, the model is a classification model that uses a hierarchical approach with evaluation functions and grouping mechanisms to label and categorize object parts accurately.",
  "model/duration": "The model, referred to as DevStaR, is designed to process images from 96-well plates and classify objects within each well into four categories: adult worm, larva, egg/embryo, or background. The algorithm runs efficiently, taking an average of 4 seconds per image. These images are typically 1200\u00d71600 pixels in size. The processing is performed on a single 3GHz Intel Xeon processor, and the current setup uses a quad-core machine with 16GB of RAM. This execution time allows for rapid analysis, making it suitable for high-throughput screening applications. The model has been demonstrated to effectively distinguish between groups of images with varying levels of lethality, and it is currently being applied to assess data from high-throughput RNA interference (RNAi) screens.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of our method, DevStaR, involved several steps to ensure its accuracy and reliability in labeling objects in biological images. We began by comparing the pixel values labeled by our algorithm with manual coloring of objects by a human expert for the same set of images. This comparison, though time-consuming, provided a benchmark for evaluating the object recognition error of DevStaR. It's important to note that while this comparison gives an idea of the algorithm's performance, it does not directly reflect typical human scoring, as biologists usually estimate the number of animals at each developmental stage rather than quantifying each pixel.\n\nWe calculated the number of false positive (FP), false negative (FN), true positive (TP), and true negative (TN) pixels segmented and labeled by DevStaR, assuming the biologist's labels were correct. This allowed us to evaluate precision and recall for the separation of objects from the background and for the segmentation and labeling of each developmental stage. Precision was calculated as TP/(TP + FP), and recall as TP/(TP + FN).\n\nOur algorithm demonstrated high precision and recall for object/background separation and adult labeling, indicating that DevStaR accurately matches human estimations of total objects and the location of adult worms in an image. However, precision and recall were lower for eggs and larvae. For eggs, mislabeling a large clump can significantly affect detection accuracy. For larvae, the small size of these objects means that boundary pixel errors can lead to substantial errors in total larval area.\n\nTo further evaluate DevStaR's performance, we used data from mutant C. elegans strains containing temperature-sensitive (ts) alleles. By adjusting the temperature, we could control lethality and measure the algorithm's ability to distinguish between different levels of lethality and survival. We used the total labeled pixel area for each developmental stage as a proxy for the number of C. elegans progeny that are alive or dead, calculating ratios of these areas as a measure of lethality and survival. Testing on over 1700 images, DevStaR successfully distinguished different levels of lethality and survival, even accounting for biological variation and measurement error.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our evaluation of the DevStaR system, we focused on several key performance metrics to assess the accuracy and reliability of our algorithm in segmenting and labeling different developmental stages of C. elegans. The primary metrics we reported include precision, recall, sensitivity, and specificity.\n\nPrecision and recall are fundamental metrics in evaluating the performance of segmentation and labeling tasks. Precision is defined as the ratio of true positive (TP) predictions to the sum of true positives and false positives (FP), indicating the accuracy of the positive predictions made by the algorithm. Recall, on the other hand, is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives (FN), reflecting the algorithm's ability to identify all relevant instances.\n\nWe also reported sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity, which is equivalent to recall in this context, measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified by the algorithm. Specificity is the ratio of true negatives (TN) to the sum of true negatives and false positives, providing insight into the algorithm's ability to correctly identify negative instances.\n\nThese metrics were evaluated for both foreground-background segmentation and the segmentation and labeling of specific developmental stages, including adults, eggs, and larvae. The precision-recall plots and sensitivity-specificity plots for these tasks are visualized in Figure 7, where each point corresponds to an image.\n\nThe choice of these metrics is representative of standard practices in the literature for evaluating segmentation and labeling algorithms, particularly in biological image analysis. Precision and recall are widely used to assess the balance between the correctness of positive predictions and the completeness of identifying all relevant instances. Sensitivity and specificity further provide a comprehensive view of the algorithm's performance by considering both positive and negative predictions.\n\nIn summary, the reported metrics\u2014precision, recall, sensitivity, and specificity\u2014offer a thorough evaluation of the DevStaR system's performance. These metrics are well-established in the field and provide a clear indication of the algorithm's effectiveness in handling the challenges posed by biological images, including variations in illumination, contrast, occlusions, and deformations.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our evaluation, we did not perform a direct comparison with publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. Instead, we focused on comparing our algorithm's performance with manual labeling by human experts. This comparison was done to assess the accuracy of our DevStaR system in labeling pixels corresponding to different developmental stages of C. elegans.\n\nThe manual labeling process involved a human expert coloring objects in the images, which is extremely time-consuming and was specifically conducted for this evaluation. This method provided us with a ground truth to calculate the number of false positives, false negatives, true positives, and true negatives segmented and labeled by our algorithm. By doing so, we could evaluate precision and recall for the separation of objects from the background and for the segmentation and labeling of each developmental stage.\n\nWhile this approach gave us an idea of the object recognition error of DevStaR, it did not represent a direct comparison with typical results of human scoring. The human experts usually estimate the number of animals at each developmental stage rather than performing detailed pixel-level labeling. Therefore, our comparison primarily served to validate the algorithm's performance against a high-accuracy, albeit labor-intensive, manual method.\n\nRegarding simpler baselines, our approach inherently includes a comparison with basic learning methods that lack grouping mechanisms. We argue that such methods would be too complex for most problems without incorporating grouping mechanisms. Our DevStaR system utilizes a hierarchical principle that includes both evaluation functions (which can be model-based or learning methods) and grouping mechanisms to resolve ambiguities in the label scores. This hierarchical approach allows for the organization of scores, ensuring that neighbor units are constrained to take similar labels, thereby producing coherent structures.\n\nIn summary, while we did not compare our method directly with other publicly available algorithms on standard benchmarks, our evaluation against manual expert labeling provided a robust assessment of our algorithm's performance. Additionally, our hierarchical approach inherently addresses the limitations of simpler baselines by integrating grouping mechanisms to enhance label accuracy.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our DevStaR system involved a comparison of pixel values labeled by the algorithm with manual coloring of objects by a human expert. This comparison allowed us to calculate the number of false positive (FP), false negative (FN), true positive (TP), and true negative (TN) pixels segmented and labeled by DevStaR. We evaluated precision and recall for the separation of objects from the background and for the segmentation and labeling of each developmental stage. Precision is defined as TP/(TP + FP), and recall is defined as TP/(TP + FN).\n\nFor the comparisons of objects/background and adult labeling, our algorithm demonstrated both high recall and precision, indicating that DevStaR accurately matches human estimations of both total objects and the location of adult worms in an image. However, precision and recall were lowest for larvae, primarily due to differences in labeling boundary pixels on these relatively small objects. Larvae are very small and contain roughly 250 pixels, so an error of one pixel around the object boundary can translate into a large error in total larval area.\n\nWe also evaluated sensitivity versus specificity for the object/background separation and for the segmentation and labeling of adults, larvae, and eggs. Sensitivity is the same as precision, and specificity is defined as TN/(TN + FP). The high specificity for the object/background separation and all developmental stages indicates that DevStaR accurately labels background pixels, which constitute many more pixels than each class of object.\n\nTo assess whether DevStaR can accurately measure the lethality or survival phenotype and discriminate between images with different levels of lethality, we used data from mutant C. elegans strains containing temperature-sensitive (ts) alleles. By adjusting the temperature, we controlled the lethality and used the total labeled pixel area for each developmental stage as a proxy for the number of C. elegans progeny that are alive (larvae) or dead (eggs). These relative areas provided sufficient discriminative power to distinguish different levels of lethality and survival.\n\nIn testing on more than 1700 images, DevStaR could clearly distinguish different levels of lethality and survival. The distribution of lethality and survival rates for a strain carrying a ts mutation in a gene essential for embryonic survival was measured at restrictive (22.5\u00b0C) and permissive (15\u00b0C) temperatures. Despite biological variation and measurement error, the distributions at the two temperatures were clearly distinct, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.",
