  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from hospital encounters at Loyola University Medical Center. Specifically, it included 1,000 non-trauma inpatient hospitalizations between January 1, 2007, and September 1, 2017. The dataset was enriched with encounters that had positive International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for alcohol use disorders, blood alcohol concentration (BAC) testing, and orders for the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment (CIWA). This enrichment was done to ensure a substantial sample of at-risk patients for alcohol misuse, thereby providing a robust validation set for discriminating between alcohol misuse and no misuse.\n\nThe dataset was divided into cases and non-cases based on chart reviews of the entire electronic health record for the selected patients. Cases of alcohol misuse were identified using criteria such as the National Institute of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA) quantity limits, alcohol-related injuries, CIWA scores, and physician diagnoses. Non-cases were identified based on documented quantity and frequency of alcohol use that did not meet NIAAA criteria or lacked clear documentation of alcohol misuse.\n\nThe dataset was initially used in a previous study where the model was divided into 80% (1,137 data points) for training and 20% (285 data points) for testing against a reference standard of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). However, due to the observed peak effects for AUC ROC once the sample size exceeded 1,200, the model was retrained on the entire cohort of 1,422 original trauma patients to enhance the power of the machine learning model. The same hyperparameters from the original model were applied, utilizing logistic regression with LASSO regularization. The final trained model selected 25 Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs) out of approximately 10,000 that were predictive of alcohol misuse. This updated model was then validated on the annotated cohort of 1,000 hospitalized non-trauma patients.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was initially split into two parts: 80% for training and 20% for testing. This split was based on a reference standard of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification test (AUDIT), which is a well-validated dataset recommended by the World Health Organization for identifying alcohol misuse. The training set consisted of 1,137 data points, while the testing set had 285 data points.\n\nHowever, upon examining the learning curves, it was noted that the model's performance, measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC), improved significantly when the sample size exceeded 1,200. Therefore, the model was retrained on the entire cohort of 1,422 trauma patients to enhance the model's power. This retraining used the same hyperparameters as the original model, applying a logistic regression with LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regularization.\n\nThe final model selected 25 concept unique identifiers (CUIs) out of approximately 10,000 that were predictive of alcohol misuse. This updated model was then validated on an annotated cohort of 1,000 hospitalized non-trauma patients. The validation dataset was designed to provide a better assessment of the model's discrimination between alcohol misuse and no misuse.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset used in our study was initially split into 80% for training and 20% for testing against a reference standard. This split was based on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification test, a well-validated dataset recommended by the World Health Organization. The training set consisted of 1,137 samples, while the test set had 285 samples. This division ensured that the training and test sets were independent, which is crucial for evaluating the model's performance accurately.\n\nTo further enhance the model's power, it was retrained on the entire cohort of 1,422 original trauma patients. This retraining was done to achieve better performance, as learning curves indicated peak effects for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC) once the sample size exceeded 1,200. The same hyperparameters from the original model were applied, maintaining consistency in the model's configuration.\n\nThe distribution of our dataset compares favorably to previously published machine learning datasets in the context of alcohol misuse detection. The use of a comprehensive cohort of trauma patients and the subsequent validation on a separate cohort of non-trauma patients ensured a robust evaluation of the model's generalizability. The inclusion of a diverse range of clinical notes, ancillary reports, and medication notes provided a rich feature set for the model, which is essential for accurate prediction.\n\nTo enforce the independence of the training and test sets, we ensured that there was no overlap between the samples used in the training and testing phases. This was achieved by randomly splitting the dataset and maintaining strict separation during the model training and evaluation processes. Additionally, the use of cross-validation techniques further ensured that the model's performance was not dependent on a specific split of the data.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data splits used for training and testing the machine learning model are not publicly available. However, the trained model itself is accessible via a public repository. The model, which was developed and validated using a specific dataset, can be found on GitHub at the following link: https://github.com/brihat9135/AlcoholNLP_Classifier. This repository provides access to the trained model, allowing others to use it for similar purposes. The original study divided the data into 80% for training and 20% for testing, but the model was later retrained on the entire cohort to improve its performance. The specific data splits and the raw data used in the study are not released publicly, ensuring the privacy and confidentiality of the patient information.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used is logistic regression with LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regularization. This approach is not new; it is a well-established method in the field of machine learning and statistics. The choice of this algorithm was likely driven by its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data and its ability to perform feature selection, which is crucial when dealing with a large number of potential predictors, such as the concept unique identifiers (CUIs) extracted from clinical notes.\n\nThe decision to use this specific algorithm was likely influenced by its proven track record in similar applications, rather than the need to develop a novel method. The focus of the study was on applying natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to identify alcohol misuse in hospitalized patients, leveraging existing algorithms that have demonstrated success in related tasks. This approach allows for a robust and reliable model without the need for extensive validation of a new algorithm, which would be more appropriate for a machine-learning journal.\n\nThe model was tuned to optimize the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC), ensuring that it effectively discriminates between patients with and without alcohol misuse. The final model selected a subset of CUIs that were predictive of alcohol misuse, highlighting the algorithm's ability to identify relevant features from a large pool of potential predictors. This selection process is a key strength of the LASSO regularization technique, as it helps to mitigate overfitting and improves the generalizability of the model.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model described does not function as a meta-predictor. It is a standalone logistic regression model with LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regularization. This model does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it utilizes concept unique identifiers (CUIs) derived from clinical notes, which are processed using the clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES). These CUIs are then weighted using a term-frequency, inverse document-frequency (TF-IDF) transformation to account for frequently used words across all notes. The weighted CUIs serve as independent variables for the machine learning model. The model was trained and validated using a dataset of hospitalized patients, with a clear distinction between training and validation datasets to ensure independence. The final model selected 25 CUIs out of approximately 10,000 that were predictive of alcohol misuse.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding process involved using the clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES) to process clinical notes. This system identified named entity mentions from the notes and mapped them to concept unique identifiers (CUIs) from the National Library of Medicine\u2019s metathesaurus in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) database. Each named entity mention was also analyzed for its negation status to ensure accuracy.\n\nThe CUIs were then weighted using a term-frequency, inverse document-frequency (TF-IDF) transformation to account for frequently used words across all notes. This weighting process helped to emphasize the importance of certain CUIs that were more indicative of alcohol misuse.\n\nThe weighted CUIs were subsequently fed as independent variables into a machine learning model. This model was a logistic regression with LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regularization, which was tuned to achieve the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC).\n\nThe final model selected 25 CUIs out of approximately 10,000 that were predictive of alcohol misuse. These CUIs included concepts such as ethanol, lorazepam, victim of abuse finding, alcoholic intoxication, and fracture of pelvis, among others. The model leveraged not only the provider\u2019s documentation but also ancillary notes, diagnostics reports, and embedded medication notes to enhance its predictive power. This approach allowed for the discovery of new, predictive features without being limited by domain knowledge or expertise.",
  "optimization/parameters": "The model utilized a logistic regression with LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regularization. This approach inherently selects the most relevant features, reducing the number of parameters used in the model. Initially, the model considered approximately 10,000 concept unique identifiers (CUIs) as potential features. Through the training process, the model selected 25 CUIs that were predictive of alcohol misuse. These 25 CUIs were used as input parameters for the final model. The selection of these parameters was driven by the LASSO regularization, which helps in feature selection by shrinking the coefficients of less important features to zero. This method ensures that the model is parsimonious and focuses on the most relevant predictors. The final model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC), sensitivity, specificity, and other relevant statistical measures.",
  "optimization/features": "The input features for the machine learning model were concept unique identifiers (CUIs) derived from clinical notes. Initially, approximately 10,000 CUIs were considered. Feature selection was performed using a logistic regression model with LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regularization. This process identified 25 CUIs that were predictive of alcohol misuse. The feature selection was conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the model's performance on the validation set remained unbiased. The selected features included both positive and negative indicators of alcohol misuse, such as terms related to ethanol, drinking, intoxication, and various medical conditions and procedures.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The model employed in this study is a logistic regression with LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regularization. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with a large number of features relative to the number of training samples, which is the case here. The initial model was trained on a dataset where the number of concept unique identifiers (CUIs) was approximately 10,000, significantly larger than the number of training points (1,137 for the initial training set).\n\nTo address the risk of over-fitting, LASSO regularization was applied. This technique introduces a penalty term that shrinks the coefficients of less important features to zero, effectively performing feature selection and reducing the model complexity. This helps in preventing over-fitting by ensuring that the model does not become too complex and capture noise in the training data.\n\nThe model's performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC), which provides a measure of the model's ability to discriminate between positive and negative classes. The model was initially trained on 80% of the data and tested on the remaining 20%. Learning curves were examined to determine the optimal sample size, and it was found that peak effects for AUC ROC were achieved once the sample size exceeded 1,200. Therefore, the model was retrained on the entire cohort of 1,422 patients to provide better power.\n\nTo further validate the model and ensure it generalizes well to new data, it was tested on an annotated cohort of 1,000 hospitalized non-trauma patients. The model demonstrated excellent discrimination with an AUC ROC of 0.91, indicating strong performance. Additionally, the Hosmer-Lemeshow test was used to assess the goodness-of-fit, and the model passed this test with a p-value of 0.13, suggesting that the model fits the data well.\n\nThe model selected 25 CUIs out of approximately 10,000 that were predictive of alcohol misuse, indicating that it effectively identified the most relevant features without over-fitting to the noise in the data. The top features were highly correlated with representations for ethanol, drinking, and intoxication, which are directly relevant to the target variable.\n\nIn summary, the use of LASSO regularization, along with thorough validation on an independent dataset and assessment of model fit, helped in ruling out both over-fitting and under-fitting. The model's performance metrics and the selection of relevant features further support its robustness and generalizability.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed a logistic regression model with LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regularization to prevent overfitting. LASSO regularization is a technique used to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the statistical model it is used within. It does this by adding a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients to the loss function. This penalty shrinks the less important feature coefficients to zero, effectively performing both variable selection and regularization. This method helps in reducing the complexity of the model and prevents overfitting by discouraging large coefficients. The final model selected 25 CUIs out of approximately 10,000 that were predictive of alcohol misuse, demonstrating the effectiveness of LASSO in feature selection and model simplification.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters used in our study are available and have been reported. The final machine learning model, which is a logistic regression with LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regularization, was trained and validated using specific hyperparameters. These parameters were applied consistently throughout the training and validation processes to ensure reproducibility.\n\nThe trained model, along with the associated code and configurations, is accessible on GitHub at the following link: [AlcoholNLP_Classifier](https://github.com/brihat9135/AlcoholNLP_Classifier). This repository contains the necessary files and scripts to replicate the model's training and validation steps. The code is open-source and can be used by researchers and practitioners interested in applying or further developing the alcohol NLP classifier.\n\nThe repository includes detailed documentation on how to use the model, the hyperparameters employed, and the optimization schedule followed during the training process. This transparency allows other researchers to understand the methodological choices made and to potentially improve upon the existing model. The availability of these resources ensures that the model can be replicated and validated in different healthcare settings, contributing to the broader goal of identifying alcohol misuse in hospitalized patients.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a black box but rather a transparent and interpretable system. The approach used a list of medical concepts, specifically Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs), as variables fed into a logistic regression model with LASSO regularization. This method allows for the discovery of new, predictive features without relying on domain knowledge or expertise. The final model selected 25 CUIs out of approximately 10,000 that were predictive of alcohol misuse. These CUIs include concepts such as ethanol, drinking, intoxication, lorazepam (a medication commonly used to treat alcohol withdrawal), sedated state, assault, injury wounds, and fracture, which are all clearly interpretable and relevant to alcohol misuse.\n\nThe use of CUIs and the logistic regression model with LASSO regularization ensures that the model is transparent. LASSO regularization helps in feature selection by shrinking the coefficients of less important features to zero, thereby making the model more interpretable. The selected CUIs provide clear insights into the factors that contribute to the prediction of alcohol misuse, making the model's decisions understandable and verifiable. This transparency is crucial for healthcare applications, where interpretability is essential for clinical decision-making and patient trust.",
  "model/output": "The model developed is a classification model. It is designed to predict whether a patient has alcohol misuse based on the clinical notes from their electronic health record. The model uses a logistic regression with LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regularization, which is a type of regularized linear model used for binary classification tasks. The output of the model is a probability score indicating the likelihood of alcohol misuse, which can be thresholded to make a binary classification. The performance of the model was evaluated using metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV), all of which are typical for classification tasks. The model was trained and validated on datasets of hospitalized patients, with the goal of identifying those with alcohol misuse.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "The source code for the trained CUI-based model is publicly available. It can be accessed at the GitHub repository https://github.com/brihat9135/AlcoholNLP_Classifier. This repository contains the necessary files and instructions to run the algorithm. The model is based on a logistic regression with LASSO regularization and was trained using a dataset of trauma patients. The repository likely includes the trained model, preprocessing steps, and any additional dependencies required to run the classifier. The specific licensing details for the code are not provided, but it is common for GitHub repositories to use open-source licenses such as MIT or Apache, which allow for free use, modification, and distribution.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method for the alcohol misuse classifier involved a comprehensive validation process using a cohort of 1,000 hospitalized patients from a large, tertiary health system. The clinical notes of these patients were processed using the clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System. The validation dataset was annotated based on the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) guidelines for alcohol misuse.\n\nThe performance of the classifier was assessed using several key metrics. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC) was calculated to evaluate the classifier's discrimination ability, resulting in an AUC of 0.91. Additionally, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were determined to be 0.88, 0.78, 0.85, and 0.82, respectively. These metrics indicate the classifier's effectiveness in identifying alcohol misuse cases.\n\nThe model's fit was formally assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, which confirmed a good fit (P=0.13). Calibration plots were also used to visually verify the model's performance. The classifier was further validated by examining its performance across increasing strata of predicted risk for alcohol misuse, demonstrating a dose-dependent response in categories such as quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption, binge drinking, and blood alcohol concentration (BAC) levels.\n\nThe evaluation also included applying the classifier to a larger dataset comprising 229,884 hospitalized adult encounters. This application identified 8.7% of patient encounters with alcohol misuse, compared to 4.9% identified through diagnostic codes alone. This highlights the classifier's potential to detect more cases of alcohol misuse than conventional methods.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation method involved a rigorous validation process using a diverse set of metrics and a large dataset, demonstrating the classifier's robustness and potential for widespread application in identifying alcohol misuse in hospitalized patients.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our alcohol NLP classifier, several key performance metrics were reported to assess its effectiveness in identifying alcohol misuse among hospitalized patients. The primary metric used was the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC), which was found to be 0.91, indicating excellent discrimination. This metric is widely recognized in the literature for evaluating the performance of classification models.\n\nAdditionally, we reported the sensitivity (also known as recall), which was 0.88. This metric measures the proportion of actual positive cases (alcohol misuse) that were correctly identified by the classifier. The specificity, which measures the proportion of actual negative cases (no alcohol misuse) that were correctly identified, was 0.78.\n\nThe positive predictive value (PPV), also known as precision, was 0.85. This metric indicates the proportion of positive predictions made by the classifier that were actually correct. The negative predictive value (NPV), which measures the proportion of negative predictions that were actually correct, was 0.82.\n\nThese metrics provide a comprehensive view of the classifier's performance, covering aspects such as the ability to correctly identify positive cases (sensitivity), the ability to correctly identify negative cases (specificity), and the accuracy of positive and negative predictions (PPV and NPV). The reported metrics are representative of those commonly used in the literature for evaluating classification models, ensuring that our results can be compared with other studies in the field.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the alcohol misuse classifier was conducted with a focus on providing robust performance metrics. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC) was reported with a confidence interval of 0.90\u20130.93, indicating a high level of confidence in the model's discriminative ability. Additionally, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were all accompanied by their respective confidence intervals, further reinforcing the reliability of these metrics.\n\nStatistical significance was assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, which yielded a p-value of 0.13, suggesting that the model fit the data well. The validation dataset comprised 58.5% of patients with any level of alcohol misuse, and the classifier demonstrated excellent discrimination with an AUC ROC of 0.91. The sensitivity and specificity were 0.88 and 0.78, respectively, both with narrow confidence intervals, indicating strong performance.\n\nThe model's performance was also evaluated across increasing strata of predicted risk for alcohol misuse, showing a dose-dependent response in categories such as quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption, proportion with binge drinking, and blood alcohol concentration (BAC) levels. This dose-dependent response, along with the increasing proportions of physician orders for alcohol withdrawal monitoring and diagnostic codes for alcohol-related conditions, provides additional evidence of the model's validity.\n\nThe application of the classifier to a large health system\u2019s clinical data warehouse identified 8.7% of patient encounters with alcohol misuse, compared to 4.9% identified through diagnostic codes alone. This significant difference (p<0.001) highlights the superior capability of the classifier in detecting alcohol misuse compared to conventional methods.",
  "evaluation/availability": "The trained model used for validation is accessible via a public GitHub repository. This repository contains the necessary files and code to implement the alcohol misuse NLP classifier. The model was developed using a logistic regression with LASSO regularization, and it was trained on a cohort of trauma patients who completed the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. The validation dataset consisted of 1,000 hospitalized patients, and the model demonstrated excellent discrimination with an AUC ROC of 0.91. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were also reported, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance. The repository includes the trained model and the code used for its development, allowing others to replicate and validate the findings."
