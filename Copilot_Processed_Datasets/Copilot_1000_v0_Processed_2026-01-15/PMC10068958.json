The machine-learning algorithms were selected for their relevance to this specific biomedical research question rather than for the innovation of the algorithms themselves. Therefore, publishing in a machine-learning journal was not the primary objective.

Among these, LUAD cells and 13 types of immune cells were selected for further analysis. The top 15% of RNAs expressed in each immune cell were identified as potential immune-related RNAs, totaling 4048 RNAs. Further refinement using the TIS core identified 135 immune-related RNAs, which were then defined as iuRNAs. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between immune cells and LUAD cells were analyzed, resulting in 68 DEGs that were significantly upregulated in immune cells compared to LUAD cells. These DEGs were defined as tumor-infiltrating immune cell RNAs (TIIC-RNAs).\n\nSix machine learning algorithms for classification\u2014Boruta, Xgboost, LassoLR, SVM, RF, and Pamr\u2014were applied to identify the 14 most valuable TIIC-RNAs based on the previously identified TIIC-RNAs.

Initially, six machine learning algorithms\u2014Boruta, Xgboost, LassoLR, SVM, RF, and Pamr\u2014were used to identify the most valuable tumor-infiltrating immune cell-related RNAs (TIIC-RNAs) from a larger set of differentially expressed genes. This approach helped in reducing the dimensionality of the data and focusing on the most relevant features, thereby addressing the concern of having a large number of parameters relative to the number of training points.\n\nTo further refine the model and ensure its generalizability, three additional machine learning algorithms\u2014LassoCox, CoxBoost, and Random Survival Forest (RSF)\u2014were applied for survival analysis. These algorithms were chosen for their ability to handle high-dimensional data and to provide regularization, which helps in preventing overfitting. The use of multiple algorithms also allowed for cross-validation and comparison of results, ensuring that the final model was not overly complex or too simplistic.\n\nThe development of the risk signature involved dimension reduction steps using CoxBoost, Lasso, and RSF algorithms, which helped in selecting the most prognostic genes. The intersection of genes identified by these algorithms was visualized using a Venn plot, ensuring that only the most robust and consistent features were included in the final model. This multi-step approach helped in ruling out overfitting by ensuring that the model was not too tailored to the training data and underfitting by including sufficient complexity to capture the underlying patterns in the data.\n\nAdditionally, the performance of the TIIC signature score was validated across multiple datasets, including TCGA and several GEO datasets. This external validation provided further evidence of the model's generalizability and robustness, confirming that it was not overfitted to a single dataset. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves and time-dependent ROC curves demonstrated the prognostic value of the TIIC signature score, further supporting the model's validity.",

These genes were identified through a novel computational framework that screened immune-related RNAs from the scRNA-seq data. The signature score is calculated based on the differential expression of these genes between immune cells and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells, providing a straightforward biological interpretation.\n\nMoreover, the prognostic value of the TIIC signature score was validated across multiple independent datasets, demonstrating its robustness and reliability. The model's transparency is further enhanced by its ability to predict survival outcomes and immunotherapy responses, which are linked to activated tumorigenic pathways such as NOTCH, WNT, JAK\u2013STAT, and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways. This biological context helps clinicians understand the underlying mechanisms driving the model's predictions.\n\nAdditionally, the TIIC signature score was compared with 168 previously established signatures, showing superior performance. This comparison provides further evidence of the model's interpretability and its potential clinical utility.
