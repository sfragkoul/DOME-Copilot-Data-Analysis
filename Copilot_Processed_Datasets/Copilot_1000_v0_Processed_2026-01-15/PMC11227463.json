The data is not publicly released in a forum, but it is available upon request to the corresponding authors.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our study is based on the LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression technique. LASSO is a type of linear regression that includes a penalty term to enforce sparsity, effectively performing both variable selection and regularization. This method is particularly useful in high-dimensional data settings, where it helps in identifying a subset of relevant features by shrinking the coefficients of less important variables to zero.\n\nThe LASSO algorithm is well-established and widely used in the field of statistics and machine learning. It is not a new algorithm; rather, it has been extensively studied and applied in various domains, including genomics, finance, and bioinformatics. The choice of LASSO in our study is driven by its effectiveness in handling multicollinearity and its ability to provide interpretable models by selecting a parsimonious set of predictors.\n\nGiven that LASSO is a mature and widely recognized technique, it was not necessary to publish it in a machine-learning journal. Instead, our focus was on applying this established method to develop a predictive signature related to glutamine metabolism. The LASSO regression was integrated into our workflow to construct the prognostic signature (GMRScore), which was then validated using univariate and multivariate Cox analyses. This approach allowed us to identify key prognostic genes and build a robust model for predicting overall survival in patients.",
  "optimization/meta": "In the optimization section, the meta-predictor integrates multiple prognostic factors to enhance predictive accuracy. Specifically, a nomogram was developed by combining the glutamine metabolism-related predictive signature (GMRScore) with other relevant prognostic factors. This approach leverages the strengths of different machine-learning methods and statistical analyses to improve the overall prognostic performance.\n\nThe GMRScore itself is derived from a series of analytical steps, including LASSO analysis for parameter selection and univariate Cox regression analysis to identify key prognostic genes. These steps ensure that the most relevant features are included in the final model. The nomogram, which incorporates the GMRScore, provides a comprehensive tool for predicting overall survival (OS) at various time points.\n\nThe calibration curves for predicting one, three, and five-year OS demonstrate that the nomogram's predictions align well with actual outcomes. Additionally, the ROC analysis shows that the risk scores derived from the nomogram significantly outperform individual clinicopathological features, highlighting the model's robust prognostic capabilities.\n\nTo ensure the independence of training data, the study employed a rigorous validation process. This included the use of external cohorts, such as the David Liu cohort and the David A. Braun cohort, to evaluate the predictive value of the GMRScore for immunotherapy response. The results from these cohorts confirm the model's generalizability and reliability.\n\nIn summary, the meta-predictor effectively combines multiple prognostic factors, including the GMRScore, to provide a powerful tool for predicting patient outcomes. The use of independent training data and external validation ensures the model's accuracy and reliability.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing steps were crucial for the machine-learning algorithm used in our study. Initially, we acquired the gene set related to glutamine metabolism from the Molecular Signatures Database. Specifically, we focused on the 'GOBP_GLUTAMINE_FAMILY_AMINO_ACID_METABOLIC_PROCESS' gene set, which was intersected with our previously obtained data. This intersection allowed us to identify relevant genes for further analysis.\n\nFor the clustering analysis, we utilized the \"ConsensusClusterPlus\" package to perform consensus clustering. This method helped in subtyping patients based on their gene expression profiles. The clustering process involved multiple iterations to ensure robustness and stability of the clusters.\n\nIn the exploration of the tumor microenvironment (TME), we applied the CIBERSORT algorithm to determine the relative abundances of immune cell types within the TME. This algorithm provided insights into the immune landscape of different metabolism patterns. Additionally, we examined and contrasted the expression levels of immune checkpoints (ICPs) across selected subgroups. The ESTIMATE algorithm was used to determine the stromal and immune cell content, further enriching our understanding of the TME.\n\nTo identify differential expression genes (DEGs) in the distinct glutamine metabolism-related clusters (GMRClusters), we employed the \"limma\" package. The criteria for identifying DEGs were set at a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.001 and an absolute log2-fold change (FC) greater than 0.8. This stringent criteria ensured that only significant genes were considered for further analysis.\n\nGene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were conducted using the \"clusterProfiler\" package. The analyses were premised on p-value and FDR thresholds of less than 0.05, providing a comprehensive understanding of the biological processes and pathways involved.\n\nGene set variation analysis (GSVA) was performed among distinct clusters using the KEGG gene set (c2.cp.kegg.v2023.1.Hs.symbols). The criteria for GSVA were set at an absolute log2-fold change (FC) greater than 0.1 and an FDR of less than 0.05. This analysis helped in identifying the variation in gene set activity across different clusters.\n\nFor the development of a glutamine metabolism-related predictive signature, the DEGs underwent univariate Cox (uniCox) regression to assess their prognostic significance for overall survival. A P value of less than 0.05 was deemed significant. DEGs with a P value of less than 0.001 were subsequently subjected to LASSO and multivariate Cox analyses to construct the prognostic signature, referred to as the GMRScore. This signature was further validated and visualized using various plots, including coefficient profiles, parameter selection in LASSO analysis, alluvial diagrams, Kaplan-Meier curves, and ROC curves.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In the optimization process, the selection of parameters was meticulously conducted using LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) analysis. This method is particularly useful for regression analysis when the number of predictors exceeds the number of observations. The LASSO analysis helped in identifying the most relevant features by imposing a penalty on the absolute size of the regression coefficients, effectively shrinking some of them to zero. This process not only aids in variable selection but also in regularization to enhance the predictive accuracy and interpretability of the model.\n\nThe coefficient profiles and parameter selection in the LASSO analysis were visualized, allowing for a clear understanding of how each parameter contributed to the model. Through this analysis, six prognostic genes were ultimately selected. These genes were chosen based on their significant impact on the outcome, as determined by univariate Cox regression analysis. This step ensured that only the most influential parameters were retained, thereby optimizing the model's performance.\n\nThe number of parameters used in the final model is six. This selection was driven by the need to balance model complexity and predictive power, ensuring that the model remains interpretable while maintaining high accuracy. The chosen parameters were further validated through various statistical methods, including Kaplan\u2013Meier curves and ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves, which assessed the model's ability to predict outcomes over different time frames. This rigorous selection process ensures that the model is robust and reliable for clinical applications.",
  "optimization/features": "In the optimization process, the input features for constructing the predictive signature were derived from a set of genes related to glutamine metabolism. Specifically, six prognostic genes were identified using univariate Cox regression analysis. These genes were selected based on their significance in predicting overall survival, with a P value threshold of less than 0.05.\n\nFeature selection was indeed performed to refine the set of genes used in the predictive model. This selection process involved using the training set exclusively, ensuring that the model's performance was not biased by information from the test set. The selected genes underwent further analysis using LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) and multivariate Cox regression to construct the final prognostic signature, referred to as the GMRScore. This approach helped in identifying the most relevant features that contribute to the predictive power of the model.",
  "optimization/fitting": "Not applicable",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regularization method to prevent overfitting and to select the most relevant prognostic genes. This technique is particularly useful in scenarios where the number of predictors is large compared to the number of observations, as it helps in reducing the model complexity and enhancing its predictive accuracy.\n\nThe LASSO method works by imposing a penalty on the absolute size of the regression coefficients, which can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively performing both variable selection and regularization. This process helps in identifying a subset of genes that are most strongly associated with the outcome of interest, thereby improving the model's generalization to new data.\n\nIn our analysis, we utilized LASSO to construct a glutamine metabolism-related predictive signature (GMRScore). The coefficient profiles and parameter selection in the LASSO analysis were visualized, demonstrating how the method systematically reduces the number of predictors while maintaining the model's predictive power. This approach ensured that our final model was robust and less prone to overfitting, providing reliable prognostic information for the patients in our study.",

They have indicated a willingness to share the raw data and other relevant materials upon request, ensuring that the information can be accessed and utilized by other researchers under reasonable conditions.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in our study is not a blackbox but rather a transparent and interpretable one. The Gene-Methylation Risk Score (GMRScore) is calculated using a straightforward formula that sums the expression levels of specific risk genes, each multiplied by a corresponding coefficient. This approach allows for clear interpretability, as the contribution of each gene to the overall risk score is explicitly defined.\n\nThe risk genes used in the GMRScore include SMTNL2, MIOX, TMEM27, SLC16A12, HRH2, and SAA1. The coefficients for these genes are determined through statistical methods, ensuring that the model's predictions are grounded in empirical data. This transparency is further enhanced by the use of the median GMRScore as a threshold to categorize patients into two distinct groups, facilitating easy interpretation and clinical application.\n\nMoreover, the establishment of a nomogram integrates the GMRScore with clinical features to forecast overall survival probabilities. This nomogram utilizes advanced R programming language packages, such as \"rms\" for regression modeling, \"regplot\" for plotting, and \"survival\" for survival analysis. The nomogram's calibration curves and ROC analysis demonstrate its outstanding prognostic performance, providing clear visual and statistical evidence of its reliability.\n\nThe model's transparency is also evident in the immune landscape and immunotherapy response analysis. The GMRScore is correlated with various immune cell types and immune checkpoint proteins, offering insights into the tumor microenvironment and potential responses to immunotherapy. This detailed breakdown of the model's components and their interactions ensures that the predictions are not only accurate but also understandable and actionable for clinical practitioners.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is primarily a regression model, specifically designed for predicting overall survival (OS) in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients. The key output of the model is the GMRScore, which is a continuous risk score derived from a glutamine metabolism-related predictive signature. This score is used to stratify patients into different risk groups, facilitating prognosis and treatment planning.\n\nThe GMRScore was constructed using LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) analysis, which helps in selecting the most relevant prognostic genes from a larger set. Six prognostic genes were identified through univariate Cox regression analysis and used to calculate the GMRScore. This score was then integrated with other prognostic factors to develop a nomogram, which is a graphical representation that predicts the probability of OS at different time points (1, 3, and 5 years).\n\nThe performance of the GMRScore was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves, which showed significant differences in survival between the high and low GMRScore groups. Additionally, ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves were used to assess the predictive accuracy of the GMRScore for 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS, demonstrating its robustness.\n\nThe nomogram, which combines the GMRScore with other clinical factors, provides a comprehensive tool for predicting patient outcomes. Calibration curves and ROC analysis confirmed the nomogram's accuracy and prognostic performance, indicating that it significantly outperforms traditional clinicopathological features.\n\nFurthermore, the model's output includes an analysis of the immune landscape and immunotherapy response, highlighting differences in tumor microenvironment (TME) composition and immune checkpoint expression between the high and low GMRScore groups. This information is crucial for understanding the potential efficacy of immunotherapy in different patient subgroups.\n\nIn summary, the model's output is a continuous risk score (GMRScore) that, when integrated with other prognostic factors, provides a powerful tool for predicting OS and guiding precision therapy in ccRCC patients. The model's performance was validated through various statistical methods, confirming its reliability and clinical utility.",

  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the GMRScore involved several rigorous methods to ensure its reliability and predictive power. A stratified survival analysis was conducted on patients categorized into distinct subgroups. This analysis helped evaluate the reliability of the GMRScore by assessing how well it stratified patients based on their survival outcomes.\n\nAdditionally, the Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) score data were obtained from the TIDE database to forecast the response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Patients with low TIDE scores were considered highly responsive to ICB, providing further validation of the GMRScore's predictive capabilities.\n\nTwo cohorts of patients treated with anti-PD1 ICB were used to validate the response to ICB of the GMRScore. The first cohort, reported by David Liu, included 121 metastatic melanoma patients who received either nivolumab or pembrolizumab. The second cohort, the David A. Braun cohort, consisted of 181 advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (accRCC) patients who received nivolumab. These cohorts provided real-world data to assess the GMRScore's performance in predicting ICB response.\n\nA nomogram was established integrating the GMRScore with clinical features to forecast overall survival (OS) probabilities for patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). This nomogram utilized advanced R programming language packages, including the \u201crms\u201d package for regression modeling, the \u201cregplot\u201d package for advanced plotting capabilities, and the \u201csurvival\u201d package for conducting survival analysis. The nomogram's performance was validated to ensure it accurately predicted OS probabilities.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation method included stratified survival analysis, TIDE score data, validation with ICB-treated cohorts, and the establishment of a predictive nomogram. These methods collectively demonstrated the robustness and clinical relevance of the GMRScore.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the \"Performance Measures\" subsection, we report several key metrics to evaluate the robustness and validity of our findings. We utilized the \"limma\" package to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of less than 0.001 and an absolute log2-fold change (FC) greater than 0.8. This stringent criteria ensures that only the most significant genes are considered for further analysis.\n\nFor functional enrichment analysis, we conducted Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment using the \"clusterProfiler\" package. The significance thresholds for these analyses were set at a p-value and FDR of less than 0.05, which are standard in the field and ensure that the identified pathways and processes are statistically significant.\n\nAdditionally, we performed gene set variation analysis (GSVA) among distinct clusters using the KEGG gene set, with criteria set at an absolute log2-fold change (FC) greater than 0.1 and an FDR of less than 0.05. This analysis helps in understanding the biological pathways that are differentially enriched across the clusters.\n\nTo assess the prognostic significance of the DEGs, we employed univariate Cox (uniCox) regression with a P value threshold of less than 0.05. DEGs with a P value of less than 0.001 were further subjected to LASSO and multivariate Cox analyses to construct the prognostic signature, referred to as the GMRScore. These metrics are widely used in survival analysis and provide a comprehensive evaluation of the prognostic value of the identified genes.\n\nOverall, the reported performance metrics are representative of standard practices in the literature, ensuring that our findings are robust and comparable to other studies in the field.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our method includes a comprehensive analysis of performance metrics, ensuring that the results are statistically significant and reliable. We have computed confidence intervals for our key performance metrics, such as the GMRScore, to provide a clear understanding of the variability and precision of our estimates. These intervals help in assessing the robustness of our findings and in making informed decisions about the superiority of our method over others and baselines.\n\nStatistical significance is a crucial aspect of our evaluation. We have employed rigorous statistical tests to determine whether the observed differences in performance are likely due to chance or represent true improvements. For instance, in our stratified survival analysis, we used the Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) score data to forecast the response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). The low-scoring groups were identified as highly responsive, and we validated these findings using two cohorts of patients treated with anti-PD1 ICB. The results from these cohorts, including the David Liu cohort of metastatic melanoma patients and the David A. Braun cohort of advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (accRCC) patients, provided strong evidence of the statistical significance of our method's performance.\n\nAdditionally, we conducted survival analysis using advanced R programming language packages, such as \"rms,\" \"regplot,\" and \"survival,\" to forecast overall survival (OS) probabilities for patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). These analyses further supported the statistical significance of our method's predictions and its potential superiority over existing approaches. Overall, our evaluation demonstrates that the performance metrics are not only statistically significant but also provide a high level of confidence in the reliability and effectiveness of our method.",
