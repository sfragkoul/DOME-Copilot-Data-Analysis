  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study consists of digitized images of stool and urine samples containing parasites. The stool samples were stained with iodine and contained eggs of Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and hookworms. Additionally, urine samples containing Schistosoma haematobium were included. A total of 13 stool samples and 4 urine samples were digitized using both a reference whole slide-scanner and a mobile microscopy scanner.\n\nThe images were captured using a mobile microscope constructed from inexpensive, mass-produced components typically used in smartphone cameras. This microscope has a 5-megapixel CMOS sensor with a maximum image resolution of 2595 \u00d7 1944 pixels. The spatial resolution of the microscope is approximately 1.23 \u03bcm, which is comparable to that of a traditional light microscope using a 10\u00d7 objective.\n\nFor the training of the deep learning algorithm, 50% of the labeled images (205 images) containing a total of 217 parasite eggs were used. The remaining 50% of the images (205 images) were used as a test set to evaluate the accuracy of the trained algorithm. The labeled images were manually annotated to indicate the center point of the objects of interest, which were then used to train the deep learning model.\n\nThe dataset includes a variety of parasites commonly found in stool and urine samples, making it relevant for the diagnosis of neglected tropical diseases. The images were captured immediately after sample preparation to prevent drying and crystallization of the acrylamide gel, ensuring high-quality data for analysis. The digitized images were saved in the Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) and further compressed to a wavelet file format (Enhanced Compressed Wavelet [ECW]) with a compression ratio of 1:9 to reduce file size while preserving sufficient spatial detail.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset used in this study was split into two main parts: a training set and a test set. The training set consisted of 218 randomly selected images of stool samples, representing single fields of view captured with a mobile microscope. These images were manually confirmed to contain visible helminth eggs. For the actual training of the algorithm, 50% of the labeled images (n = 205) containing a total of 217 parasite eggs were used. The distribution of these eggs was as follows: 195 were Ascaris lumbricoides, 6 were Trichuris trichiura, and 16 were hookworm eggs.\n\nThe remaining 50% of the images (n = 205) were used as the test set to evaluate the accuracy of the trained algorithm. This test set also contained a total of 217 parasite eggs, with the same distribution as the training set: 195 Ascaris lumbricoides, 6 Trichuris trichiura, and 16 hookworm eggs. The test set was used to assess the sensitivity and positive predictive value of the algorithm for detecting and classifying these parasite species.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used is deep learning, specifically designed for image analysis and classification tasks. This type of algorithm is not new; it represents the state-of-the-art in machine learning and has gained significant attention due to its high performance in various image classification tasks.\n\nThe choice to use deep learning was driven by its proven effectiveness in pattern recognition, which is crucial for identifying and classifying helminth eggs in digitized samples. The algorithm was developed using a commercially available image analysis software platform that supports the creation of both supervised and unsupervised image analysis algorithms.\n\nThe focus of the study was on applying this technology to the detection of soil-transmitted helminths and Schistosoma haematobium, rather than on the development of a new machine-learning algorithm. Therefore, the algorithm itself was not the primary innovation but rather its application in a novel context\u2014point-of-care diagnostics using a low-cost, portable digital microscope.\n\nThe results demonstrated high sensitivity for the detection of helminths, with sensitivities ranging from 83.3% to 100% for different types of helminth eggs. This indicates that deep learning-based image analysis can be effectively utilized for automated detection and classification of helminths in captured images, even with a limited training set. The study highlights the potential of this technology to facilitate sample analysis and reduce turnover time for sample evaluation, particularly in resource-limited environments.",
  "optimization/meta": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure optimal performance. Initially, all color images were converted into grayscale to simplify the analysis and reduce computational complexity. This conversion helped in focusing on the structural features of the helminth eggs rather than their color variations.\n\nThe training set consisted of 218 randomly selected images of stool samples, each representing a single field of view captured with a mobile microscope. These images were manually confirmed to contain visible helminth eggs. The images were annotated by indicating the center point of the object of interest, which allowed the software to generate a deep learning model for locating candidate areas of interest, specifically helminth eggs.\n\nTo enhance the robustness of the model, automatic perturbation of the training images was performed. This involved creating synthetic variations of the images through methods such as rotation, scaling, flipping, and adjustment of contrast and luminance. These perturbations helped the algorithm to generalize better and recognize helminth eggs under various conditions.\n\nThe training process utilized a two-step algorithm. The first algorithm analyzed the entire image to identify potential helminth egg candidates by comparing image features with learned parameters of the objects of interest. This algorithm was trained to identify any type of helminth egg based on manually annotated regions of interest, focusing on location and size.\n\nThe regions of interest detected by the first algorithm were then fed into a second classifier. This classifier was trained to identify different helminth species and analyzed exclusively the candidate regions of interest, which were approximately 200 \u00d7 200 pixels in size. The classifier assigned these regions to one of four categories: *Ascaris lumbricoides*, *Trichuris trichiura*, hookworm, or other (e.g., artifacts). The results of the analysis and classification were exported, showing the total number of fields of view analyzed, results from manual scoring, and results from computer analysis. The actual regions of interest were also exported into the report, along with an assigned probability value for each class, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the detected helminth eggs.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the model utilized for digital image analysis employed deep learning-based machine-learning algorithms. The specific number of parameters (p) in the model is not explicitly stated, as it can vary depending on the architecture and complexity of the deep learning models used. However, deep learning models typically involve a large number of parameters due to their multiple layers and neurons.\n\nThe selection of the model's parameters was guided by the need to accurately identify and classify helminth eggs in digitized samples. The training process involved labeling a set of images on an object level, where images were annotated by indicating the center point of the object of interest. This labeled data was used to generate a deep learning model for locating candidate areas of interest, specifically helminth eggs. The model was trained to identify any type of helminth egg based on manually annotated regions of interest, which included location and size.\n\nThe training set consisted of 218 randomly selected images of stool samples, each representing a single field of view captured with a mobile microscope. These images were manually confirmed to contain visible helminth eggs. The model for identification consisted of two sequential algorithms: the first algorithm analyzed the whole image for helminth egg candidates by comparing image features with learned parameters of the objects of interest. The second algorithm then classified these candidate regions into different helminth species.\n\nThe training process also included automatic perturbation of the training images, creating synthetic variations such as rotation, scaling, flipping, and adjustment of contrast and luminance. This augmentation helped to improve the robustness and generalization of the model.\n\nIn summary, while the exact number of parameters in the model is not specified, the selection and training of the model parameters were carefully designed to ensure high accuracy in identifying and classifying helminth eggs in digitized samples.",
  "optimization/features": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/fitting": "Not applicable",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and enhance the robustness of our deep learning-based image analysis algorithm. One key method involved the use of data augmentation, where we created synthetic variations of the training images. This process included techniques such as rotation, scaling, flipping, and adjustments to contrast and luminance. By generating these perturbed images, we effectively increased the diversity of our training dataset, helping the model to generalize better to unseen data.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized a two-step algorithmic approach. The first algorithm was trained to identify any type of helminth egg based on manually annotated regions of interest. The second algorithm then classified these candidate regions into specific parasite species. This sequential approach allowed the model to focus on relevant areas of the images, reducing the likelihood of overfitting to irrelevant features.\n\nFurthermore, we converted all color images to grayscale for training and analysis. This simplification reduced the complexity of the input data, making it easier for the model to learn relevant features without being distracted by color variations.\n\nThese regularization techniques collectively helped to mitigate overfitting and improve the performance of our algorithm in detecting and classifying helminth eggs in digitized samples.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a blackbox. It utilizes a deep learning-based image analysis algorithm that provides transparency through several mechanisms. The algorithm consists of two sequential stages. The first stage analyzes the entire image to identify candidate regions that might contain helminth eggs. These candidates are then passed to the second stage, which classifies them into specific parasite species or artifacts. This two-step process allows for a clear understanding of how the model arrives at its decisions.\n\nThe software also exports the detected regions of interest, grouped by the likelihood of representing a parasite. This feature enables users to review the most significant areas quickly and confirm parasitic infections. Additionally, the software assigns a probability percentage to each classified region, indicating the confidence level for each classification. This probabilistic output further enhances the interpretability of the model's decisions.\n\nMoreover, the training process includes synthetic variations of images, such as rotation, scaling, and adjustments in contrast and luminance. This perturbation helps the model generalize better and understand various presentations of the same parasite, making its decision-making process more transparent and reliable. The use of grayscale images for training and analysis also simplifies the feature extraction process, focusing on the structural characteristics of the parasites rather than color variations.",
  "model/output": "The model developed for this study is a classification model. It is designed to identify and classify different types of helminth eggs in digitized stool samples. The model consists of two sequential algorithms. The first algorithm scans the entire image to detect candidate regions that might contain helminth eggs. These candidate regions are then passed to a second classifier, which identifies the specific type of helminth species present.

All color images are converted into grayscale for the training and analysis process.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "The software platform used for the digital image analysis of the samples is a commercially available image analysis software called WebMicroscope, developed by Fimmic Oy, Helsinki, Finland. This software utilizes deep learning-based machine-learning algorithms to create models for computer vision applications, specifically for the analysis and classification of image features.\n\nThe software supports the creation of both supervised and unsupervised image analysis algorithms. Training of the algorithms is done by labeling a set of images on an object level, where images are annotated by indicating the center point of the object of interest. The software then generates a deep learning model for locating candidate areas of interest, such as helminth eggs. These candidate areas are subsequently assigned to different classes representing the different parasite species.\n\nThe training set used for the creation of the algorithms consisted of 218 randomly selected images of stool samples, representing single fields of view captured with the mobile microscope. These images were manually confirmed to contain visible helminth eggs. The model for the identification of the parasites consists of two sequential algorithms. The first algorithm analyzes the whole image for helminth egg candidates by comparing image features with learned parameters of the objects of interest. The regions of interest detected by the first algorithm are then fed forward to a second classifier trained to identify the different helminth species. This classifier analyzes exclusively the candidate regions of interest identified by the first algorithm and classifies these into one of four categories: A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura, hookworm, or other (e.g., artifacts).\n\nThe results of the analysis and classification are exported from the software as a single panel showing the total number of fields of view analyzed, results from manual scoring, and results from computer analysis. The actual regions of interest are also exported into the report, along with an assigned value of probability of the candidate areas representing one of the four classes. The software calculates this value with a probability percentage (0\u2013100%) for each class, corresponding to a total sum of 100%.\n\nThe software is not publicly released.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method involved a split of the labeled images into two sets: one for training and one for testing. Half of the labeled images, totaling 205 images with 217 parasite eggs, were used to train the algorithm. The remaining 205 images served as the test set to evaluate the algorithm's accuracy. The sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) were calculated on an object level. Sensitivity was determined by the percentage of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives. PPV was obtained by the percentage of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false positives. The algorithm's performance was assessed by comparing its results to manual labeling of helminth eggs in the images, which was performed by two researchers. The labels used for analysis were those where both observers agreed on the location and species of the helminth. The evaluation focused on the algorithm's ability to detect and classify different types of helminth eggs, including A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura, and hookworm eggs. The results showed high sensitivity for parasite detection, even with a limited amount of training data. The algorithm's performance was also compared to a high-end, automated whole slide-scanner to benchmark imaging performance. The evaluation demonstrated that the algorithm could reliably detect and classify helminth eggs in digitized samples, showing promise for automated helminth egg detection in clinical settings.",
  "evaluation/measure": "The performance of the algorithm was evaluated using several key metrics to assess its effectiveness in detecting and classifying helminth eggs. Sensitivity, which measures the proportion of true positives correctly identified by the algorithm, was reported for each type of helminth egg. For A. lumbricoides, the sensitivity was 100%, indicating that all labeled eggs were correctly detected. For T. trichiura, the sensitivity was 83.3%, and for hookworm eggs, it was 93.8%. These metrics provide a clear indication of the algorithm's ability to accurately identify the presence of different types of helminth eggs.\n\nPositive Predictive Value (PPV), which measures the proportion of positive identifications that are true positives, was also reported. For A. lumbricoides, the PPV was 93.7%, meaning that out of all the eggs identified as A. lumbricoides, 93.7% were correct. For T. trichiura, the PPV was 100%, indicating no false positives for this type of egg. For hookworm eggs, the PPV was 69.6%, suggesting a higher rate of false positives compared to the other types.\n\nThe number of false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN) were also documented. For A. lumbricoides, there were 13 false positives and 0 false negatives. For T. trichiura, there was 1 false negative and no false positives. For hookworm eggs, there were 7 false positives and 1 false negative. These metrics help in understanding the types of errors the algorithm is prone to, which is crucial for improving its performance.\n\nThe evaluation also included a discussion on the potential increase in false positives as the number of images analyzed increases. This highlights the importance of manual review in conjunction with the algorithm to reduce false positives and ensure accurate diagnosis.\n\nOverall, the reported metrics are representative of standard performance measures used in similar studies, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the algorithm's effectiveness in detecting and classifying helminth eggs. The sensitivity and PPV metrics, along with the documentation of false positives and negatives, offer a clear picture of the algorithm's strengths and areas for improvement.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we did not perform a direct comparison with publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. Instead, we focused on demonstrating the feasibility of using a low-cost, portable digital microscope for helminth egg detection and the effectiveness of deep learning-based image analysis in this context.\n\nWe did, however, compare the imaging performance of our mobile microscope with a high-end, automated whole slide-scanner. Both devices were able to resolve the most common helminth eggs in stool and Schistosoma haematobium in urine samples visually in digitized slides. The spatial resolution of the reference slide-scanner was higher, but all species of parasites studied could be clearly resolved in the images acquired with both devices.\n\nRegarding simpler baselines, our approach utilized deep learning-based machine-learning algorithms for image analysis, which is considered state-of-the-art for pattern recognition tasks. We did not compare our method to simpler, non-deep learning baselines. The choice of deep learning was motivated by its high performance in various image classification tasks, as seen in recent studies.\n\nIn summary, while we did not compare our method with publicly available methods on benchmark datasets or simpler baselines, we did validate our approach against a high-end whole slide-scanner and demonstrated its potential for point-of-care diagnostics.",
