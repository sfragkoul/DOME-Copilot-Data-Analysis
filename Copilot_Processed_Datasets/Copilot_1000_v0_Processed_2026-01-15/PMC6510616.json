  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was derived from a female 8-week-old C57BL/6 mouse. The specific region of interest was the genu of the corpus callosum (CC). The tissue was excised from the midsagittal slice of the dissected brain and sampled from the central region of the genu. The tissue was then fixed using a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde, and 0.1M sucrose in 0.1M phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.4). Subsequent fixation involved a PB containing 2% OsO4 and 1.5%.\n\nThe dataset consists of high-resolution 3D electron microscopy (EM) images of myelinated axons. The segmentation methods employed, including the ground-truth manual segmentation and the RaW algorithm, were applied to this dataset. The ground-truth segmentation involved labor-intensive manual carving facilitated by the ilastik Carving function, while the RaW algorithm relied on a binary myelin mask to segment the axons.\n\nApproximately 70% of the axons crossing the central slice were successfully segmented using the RaW algorithm. However, about 30% of the axons were deleted during proofreading due to an imperfect myelin mask, which resulted in segmentation errors such as random-hopping trajectories infiltrating into other axons or compartments.\n\nThis dataset has not been previously used in other publications by the community. The study focuses on the development and validation of a semi-automatic segmentation algorithm for myelinated axons, which is crucial for quantifying sizes and orientations of white matter (WM) axons. The dataset provides a foundation for future research in understanding the microstructural characteristics of WM axons and their implications in neuroimaging studies.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our study is a random-hopping diffusion process, specifically the Random-Walker algorithm (RaW). This algorithm is not entirely new but has been adapted and simplified for our purposes. It is a seeded-region-growing algorithm that operates on a binary mask. The RaW algorithm was chosen for its efficiency in segmenting the intra-axonal space (IAS) of myelinated axons, reducing the need for extensive manual seeding and proofreading.\n\nThe RaW algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal because its primary application in this context is for image segmentation in neuroimaging, rather than a novel contribution to the field of machine learning. The focus of our work is on the application of this algorithm to segment axons in brain tissue, which falls under the domain of neuroscience and biomedical imaging. The algorithm's effectiveness in this specific application is what we aimed to demonstrate, rather than introducing a new machine-learning technique.",

  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding process involved several steps to prepare the brain tissue sample for analysis. Initially, the tissue was stained using a sequence of chemicals: potassium ferrocyanide, thiocarbohydrazide, osmium tetroxide, and uranyl acetate. This staining process was followed by an En Bloc lead staining to enhance membrane contrast. The sample was then dehydrated using alcohol and acetone before being embedded in Durcupan ACM resin.\n\nThe prepared tissue was analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) under high-vacuum pressure. This resulted in the acquisition of 401 consecutive images, each with a resolution of 6000 \u00d7 8000 pixels. These images represented a volume of 36 \u00d7 48 \u00d7 40.1 \u03bcm\u00b3 with a voxel size of 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 100 nm\u00b3.\n\nTo reduce computational cost without compromising segmentation accuracy, the images were down-sampled to a resolution of 24 \u00d7 24 \u00d7 100 nm\u00b3 using Lanczos interpolation. Geometric distortions in the slices were corrected by comparing each slice with its adjacent slices. The first 200 images showed minimal distortion, with only one image requiring mild correction using optical flow estimation. The subsequent 201 slices contained significant distortions, signal dropouts, or complete signal loss, leading to their exclusion from further analysis. Therefore, a subset of 200 slices, representing a volume of 36 \u00d7 48 \u00d7 20 \u03bcm\u00b3, was selected for analysis.\n\nThe intra-axonal space (IAS) of myelinated axons was segmented using a random-hopping diffusion process, known as the Random-Walker algorithm (RaW). This algorithm involved manually seeding an initial position per axon within the central slice and filling the IAS by diffusion trajectories of particles. The diffusion was confined by a myelin mask obtained using a pixel-wise classifier. Segmented axons with imperfect myelin masks were deleted through proofreading, resulting in an IAS mask of 321 segmented axons comprising 59,231 axon cross-sections. The IAS segmentation was completed by automatically seeding within the previously generated diffusion trajectories confined by a non-leaky myelin mask. The seeding density was set at one seed per ten slices for each axon, filled with 10,000 particles per seed with 40,000 steps. The IAS mask was down-sampled to a resolution of (100 nm)\u00b3 for further analysis of axon geometries, such as fiber dispersion, axonal diameter, myelin thickness, and g-ratio.\n\nAll processing steps were implemented in Matlab and accelerated using parallel computation with 12 CPU cores. The total processing time, including manual seeding, numerical computations, and proofreading, was approximately 2 days.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized spherical harmonics (SH) coefficients to model the fiber orientation distribution (FOD). Specifically, we focused on the rotational invariants, denoted as pl, which are directly estimated within a rotationally-invariant framework. These invariants are particularly useful for characterizing the axial symmetry of the FOD.\n\nThe number of parameters, p, in our model corresponds to the order of the SH coefficients used. We tested the applicability of an empirical power law functional form for the axially symmetric FOD, proposed by Reisert et al. (2017), which is given by pl = p0 \u00b7 \u03bbl of the Poisson kernel. Here, p0 is a constant (equivalently 1), and \u03bb is a dispersion parameter that ranges from 0 to 1. This power-law behavior was verified for orders l ranging from 2 to 10.\n\nThe selection of p was guided by the need to accurately capture the FOD's shape while ensuring computational efficiency. The rotational invariants approximately obey this power-law, and we found that this behavior is not well-normalized and overshoots at l = 0. The dispersion parameters (\u03bb, C) were obtained using a linear fit of log pl with respect to l = 2-10, where the fitted C > 1 indicates the overshoot of the power-law relation at l = 0.\n\nIn summary, our model uses SH coefficients up to the 10th order to characterize the FOD, with the number of parameters, p, corresponding to these orders. The selection of p was based on the observed power-law behavior of the rotational invariants and the need for an accurate and efficient representation of the FOD.",

  "model/interpretability": "The model presented in our work is not a black-box but rather a transparent and interpretable pipeline. The semi-automatic intra-axonal space (IAS) segmentation process involves clear, step-by-step procedures that can be easily understood and verified. The pipeline begins with the acquisition of a tissue sample, followed by the generation of a myelin mask using a pixel-wise classifier. This mask is then used to guide a random diffusion grid-hopping process, where seeds are manually assigned to initiate the segmentation. The trajectories of this process are bounded by the myelin mask, ensuring that the segmented IAS remains within the intended regions. The resulting IAS segments are then used to define individual myelin sheaths, which are further processed to separate touching sheaths using a non-weighted watershed algorithm. This entire process allows for numerical simulations in a 3D realistic microstructure, providing a clear and interpretable pathway from raw data to final segmentation.\n\nOne of the key transparent aspects of our model is the use of visual aids, such as figures, to illustrate each step of the pipeline. For example, Figure 1 visually represents the entire segmentation process, from the initial tissue sample to the final 3D microstructure. This visual representation makes it easier to understand how each component of the model contributes to the overall segmentation process.\n\nAdditionally, the model's parameters and their effects are well-documented. For instance, the myelin thickness upper bound used for dilating the segmented IAS to further segment the myelin sheath can influence g-ratio estimations. By providing detailed information on how different upper bound values affect the segmentation and g-ratio calculations, we ensure that users can make informed decisions when applying the model to their own data.\n\nThe model also includes validation steps, such as comparing the segmentation results to a ground-truth manual segmentation. This comparison is quantified using metrics like the Jaccard index and the S\u00f8rensen-Dice index, providing a transparent way to evaluate the model's performance. Furthermore, the model's robustness is demonstrated through high values of similarity metrics, reinforcing its reliability and interpretability.\n\nIn summary, the model is designed to be transparent and interpretable, with clear visual aids, well-documented parameters, and validation steps. This ensures that users can understand and trust the segmentation process, making it a valuable tool for research in brain structure and function.",
  "model/output": "The model discussed in this publication is primarily focused on segmentation and quantification tasks rather than traditional classification or regression. Specifically, it involves the segmentation of intra-axonal space (IAS) in myelinated axons using a semi-automatic pipeline. This pipeline includes steps such as acquiring tissue samples, obtaining a myelin mask through pixel-wise classification, and using a random-hopping process to fill the IAS. The output of this model is the segmented IAS and individual myelin sheaths, which are then used to perform numerical simulations and quantify various metrics related to axonal size and orientation.\n\nThe metrics quantified include size-related measures such as g-ratio, inner and outer axonal diameters, and orientation-related metrics like the fiber orientation distribution (FOD) and dispersion angles. These outputs are crucial for understanding the microstructure of the brain and can be used for further analysis and simulations.\n\nThe model's performance is evaluated by comparing the segmented IAS to a ground-truth manual segmentation, using metrics like the Jaccard index and the S\u00f8rensen-Dice index. High values of these similarity metrics indicate the robustness of the segmentation pipeline.\n\nIn summary, the model's output is centered around the segmentation and quantification of axonal structures, providing detailed insights into the brain's microstructure. This information is essential for various applications in neuroscience and medical research.",
  "model/duration": "The total processing time for our model, including manual seeding, numerical computations, and proofreading, was approximately 2 days. This was achieved using parallel computation with 12 CPU cores. The process involved down-sampling images, correcting geometric distortions, and segmenting the intra-axonal space using a random-hopping diffusion process. The segmentation was performed on a subset of 200 slices, which represented a volume of 36 \u00d7 48 \u00d7 20 \u03bcm\u00b3. The model's efficiency was enhanced by using Matlab for implementation and leveraging parallel processing to handle the computational demands.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the method involved a comparison between the segmentations obtained using the RaW algorithm and a ground-truth manual segmentation. The manual segmentation was facilitated by the ilastik Carving function, which was used to initialize the process. This ground-truth segmentation covered the inner axonal space (IAS) entirely, including the cytoplasm and organelles, and required significant manual effort, taking approximately 12 weeks to complete for about 100 axons per person.\n\nThe RaW algorithm, on the other hand, was applied to segment the IAS of approximately 320 myelinated axons, resulting in around 59,000 cross-sections. To validate the RaW method, the segmentation results were compared to the ground-truth for 97 selected axons. The comparison was based on several similarity metrics, including the Jaccard index, the S\u00f8rensen-Dice index, the foreground-restricted Rand F-score (Vrand), and the information theoretic F-score (Vinfo). These metrics provided a quantitative measure of the agreement between the two segmentation methods.\n\nThe Jaccard index and the S\u00f8rensen-Dice index were computed for individual IAS segmentations, while Vrand and Vinfo were calculated for the IAS segmentations of all axons. The Jaccard index is the ratio of the intersection to the union of the segmented areas from both methods, and the S\u00f8rensen-Dice index is the ratio of the intersection to the average of the segmented areas. Vrand and Vinfo are related to the Rand index and the variation of information, respectively, and provide additional measures of segmentation accuracy.\n\nThe evaluation demonstrated that for most axons, the Jaccard and S\u00f8rensen-Dice indices were high, indicating a strong agreement between the RaW segmentations and the ground-truth. This robustness was further supported by the high values of the similarity metrics reported in the study. The RaW algorithm was found to be reliable and efficient, significantly reducing the need for manual seeding and proofreading compared to the manual segmentation process.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our segmentation method, we employed several performance metrics to compare the inner axonal space (IAS) segmentations obtained using our method, referred to as RaW, against the ground-truth manual segmentations. The metrics used include the Jaccard Index, the S\u00f8rensen-Dice index, the foreground-restricted Rand F-score (Vrand), and the information theoretic F-score (Vinfo).\n\nThe Jaccard Index and the S\u00f8rensen-Dice index are widely used in the literature for evaluating the similarity between two segmentations. The Jaccard Index is calculated as the ratio of the intersection of the two segmentations to their union, while the S\u00f8rensen-Dice index is the ratio of the intersection to the average of the two segmentations. These metrics provide a straightforward measure of the overlap between the segmentations, with higher values indicating better agreement.\n\nIn addition to these traditional metrics, we also reported the Vrand and Vinfo scores. The Vrand score is closely related to the Rand index, which measures the similarity between two data clusterings by considering all pairs of samples and checking whether they are assigned to the same or different clusters. The Vinfo score, on the other hand, is related to the variation of information, which measures the amount of information lost or gained when one clustering is used to estimate another.\n\nThe use of these metrics is representative of the current literature in the field. The Jaccard Index and the S\u00f8rensen-Dice index are commonly used for evaluating segmentation performance, while the Vrand and Vinfo scores provide additional insights into the similarity between the segmentations at a more granular level. By reporting these metrics, we aim to provide a comprehensive evaluation of our segmentation method and its agreement with the ground-truth manual segmentations.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we conducted a thorough comparison of our proposed method, RaW, with a manual segmentation approach that was initialized using the ilastik Carving function. This manual method is considered a ground-truth for our evaluations.\n\nWe segmented the inner axonal space (IAS) of approximately 320 myelinated axons using RaW, resulting in around 59,000 cross-sections. To validate RaW, we compared its segmentation results with a ground-truth dataset consisting of 97 selected axons that were manually segmented with the aid of ilastik.\n\nThe manual segmentation process involved several steps to ensure accuracy. Each 2D image was smoothed and filtered to enhance important features such as cell membranes, mitochondria, and myelin sheaths. Markers were manually assigned within and outside the IAS across multiple slices to initiate and refine the segmentation process. This manual correction step was crucial, especially for handling mitochondria attached to the myelin sheath and nodes of Ranvier.\n\nThe comparison between the two methods was based on several similarity metrics. The Jaccard index and the S\u00f8rensen-Dice index were computed for individual IAS segmentations. Additionally, the foreground-restricted Rand F-score (Vrand) and the information theoretic F-score (Vinfo) were calculated for IAS segmentations across all axons. These metrics provided a comprehensive evaluation of the segmentation accuracy and robustness.\n\nThe Jaccard index for each axon was determined by the ratio of the intersection pixel count to the union pixel count of IAS segmentations from both methods. The S\u00f8rensen-Dice index was calculated as the ratio of the intersection pixel count to the average pixel count of IAS segmentations from both methods. The Vrand and Vinfo scores are closely related to the Rand index and the variation of information, respectively, and provided further insights into the segmentation performance.\n\nOur results showed that for most axons, both the Jaccard index and the S\u00f8rensen-Dice index were high, indicating the robustness of the RaW segmentation pipeline. This was further supported by the high values of the similarity metrics reported in our study.\n\nIn summary, while we did not compare our method to publicly available benchmark datasets, we performed a rigorous comparison with a well-established manual segmentation approach. This comparison included the use of multiple similarity metrics, providing a comprehensive evaluation of our method's performance.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our segmentation method, RaW, was conducted by comparing it to a ground-truth manual segmentation. We used several similarity metrics to quantify the agreement between the two methods. These metrics included the Jaccard Index, the S\u00f8rensen-Dice index, the foreground-restricted Rand F-score (Vrand), and the information theoretic F-score (Vinfo). The values for these metrics were reported as point estimates, with the Jaccard Index at 0.85, the S\u00f8rensen-Dice index at 0.92, Vrand at 0.68, and Vinfo at 0.89. However, confidence intervals for these metrics were not provided in the study.\n\nTo assess the statistical significance of our results, we compared the segmentation outcomes for individual axons. The histograms of the Jaccard index and the S\u00f8rensen-Dice index showed high values for most axons, indicating a robust performance of the RaW method. This suggests that the differences observed between RaW and the ground-truth segmentation are likely not due to random chance, but rather reflect the true performance of the method.\n\nWhile the study did not explicitly report p-values or perform statistical tests to compare the metrics directly, the high similarity indices and the visual agreement between the segmentations (as shown in the representative slice) provide strong evidence of the method's reliability. The RaW algorithm demonstrated a significant reduction in manual labor compared to the ground-truth method, segmenting approximately 320 axons in about 2 days, whereas the ground-truth method required about 12 weeks for around 100 axons. This efficiency, combined with the high similarity metrics, supports the claim that RaW is a superior and more practical method for IAS segmentation.",
