  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset utilized in our study originates from a cohort of patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infections. Specifically, we targeted a substantial number of patients, totaling 6,051 individuals from Korea. This dataset was employed to construct and validate a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk prediction model using artificial intelligence, particularly the gradient-boosting machine method. The variables considered in this model included age, gender, HBV DNA levels, and liver stiffness measurement (LSM), among others. These variables were chosen based on their established relevance in predicting HCC risk in CHB patients.\n\nPrevious studies have also utilized similar datasets and variables to develop and validate HCC risk prediction models. For instance, models such as PAGE-B, REACH-B, and CU-HCC have been developed using large cohorts of CHB patients from various regions, including Asia and Hong Kong. These models have been validated in different populations, demonstrating their generalizability and reliability. The use of LSM, in particular, has been a common variable in many of these models, highlighting its importance in predicting HCC risk.\n\nThe dataset used in our study is part of a broader effort to improve the accuracy and applicability of HCC risk prediction models. By incorporating advanced AI techniques and validating the model across diverse populations, we aim to provide a more precise and widely applicable tool for clinicians managing CHB patients. The inclusion of a large number of data points ensures that the model is robust and can be generalized to different patient populations.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our study falls under the category of gradient-boosting machines. This method is well-established in the field of machine learning and is known for its effectiveness in predictive modeling tasks.\n\nThe gradient-boosting machine method used is not a novel algorithm. It has been extensively used and validated in various domains, including medical research. The decision to use this particular algorithm was driven by its proven track record in handling complex datasets and delivering high predictive accuracy.\n\nGiven that the gradient-boosting machine method is a widely recognized and established technique, it was deemed more appropriate to publish the findings in a medical journal rather than a machine-learning journal. The focus of our study was on the application of this method to predict hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infections, rather than the development of a new machine-learning algorithm. This approach aligns with the objectives of our research, which is to leverage existing advanced technologies to improve medical outcomes.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model discussed in the publication does not explicitly mention the use of a meta-predictor approach. The primary focus is on utilizing artificial intelligence, specifically the gradient-boosting machine method, to construct an optimal model for predicting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infections.\n\nThe gradient-boosting machine method is a type of ensemble learning technique that builds a strong predictive model by combining the outputs of multiple weak learners, typically decision trees. This approach does not inherently involve using data from other machine-learning algorithms as input in the traditional sense of a meta-predictor. Instead, it leverages the iterative process of adding new models to correct the errors of the previous ones.\n\nThe model was validated on both Korean and Caucasian populations, demonstrating better predictive power compared to previously reported models such as PAGE-B, REACH-B, and CU-HCC. This validation process ensures that the training data is independent and that the model's performance is robust across different demographic groups.\n\nIn summary, while the model employs advanced machine-learning techniques, it does not operate as a meta-predictor that combines the outputs of diverse machine-learning algorithms. The focus is on the gradient-boosting machine method, which is a powerful ensemble technique in its own right.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several key steps to ensure the model's effectiveness and reliability. Initially, various factors related to the host, viral activity, and cirrhosis were considered. Host factors such as age and sex were included, with some models also incorporating family histories of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or diabetes. Variables related to viral activity, including HBeAg, HBV DNA, and elevated ALT levels, were recognized as useful predictors of HCC. However, for patients using antiviral drugs, these viral activity factors were not always normalized or detected, reducing their significance in these cases.\n\nCirrhosis, present in 70\u201380% of HCC patients, was identified as an important variable. The diagnosis of cirrhosis in clinical practice can be unclear due to reliance on imaging tests and clinical symptoms rather than pathological results. To address this, liver stiffness measurement (LSM) values were sometimes used as a variable in HCC prediction models. Additionally, new factors such as serum N-glycan biosignatures, gamma glutamyl transferase isoenzyme II, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, interleukin-6, serum programmed death receptor 1, and HBV pre-S mutants were explored for their potential in predicting HCC.\n\nFor the machine-learning algorithm, the data was preprocessed to include relevant variables such as age, gender, HBV DNA levels, and LSM values. The gradient-boosting machine method was employed to construct an optimal model. The model was validated on both Korean and Caucasian populations, demonstrating better predictive power compared to previously reported models like PAGE-B, REACH-B, and CU-HCC. The use of a simple scoring system, rather than a complex formula, was suggested for developing a widely accepted predictive model for HCC in patients with chronic hepatitis B infections. This approach aims to balance accuracy with practicality in clinical settings.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the number of parameters used in the model varied depending on the specific risk prediction model for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infections. For instance, models like the GAG-HCC and CU-HCC used four and five variables, respectively. The REACH-B model, which is widely used, incorporates five variables: age, sex, HBV-DNA levels, cirrhosis status, and HBeAg. Other models, such as the LS model and LSM-HCC, also utilized four variables, including liver stiffness measurement (LSM).\n\nThe selection of these parameters was based on a comprehensive review of various factors known to influence the risk of HCC. These factors include host characteristics like age and sex, viral activity indicators such as HBV DNA levels and HBeAg status, and the presence of cirrhosis. Additionally, some models incorporated liver stiffness measurements to account for the degree of liver fibrosis, which is a critical factor in HCC development.\n\nThe choice of parameters aimed to balance the need for accurate prediction with the practicality of clinical application. For example, models like REACH-B, PAGE-B, and AASL use simple integer scoring systems, making them more user-friendly in clinical settings. This approach ensures that the models are not only reliable but also efficient and cost-effective, aligning with the goals of developing an ideal HCC risk prediction model for CHB patients.",
  "optimization/features": "The input features used in the models vary depending on the specific model and the population studied. Generally, models predicting the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infections utilize a combination of host factors, viral activity indicators, and cirrhosis-related variables.\n\nHost factors commonly include age and sex, with some models also considering family history of HCC or diabetes. Viral activity indicators such as HBeAg, HBV DNA levels, and elevated ALT levels are frequently used, although their significance can diminish in patients undergoing antiviral treatment. Cirrhosis, present in a majority of HCC cases, is a critical variable, often assessed through imaging and clinical symptoms rather than pathological results. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) values are sometimes included to compensate for the challenges in diagnosing cirrhosis.\n\nFeature selection is typically performed to identify the most relevant variables for predicting HCC risk. This process often involves using the training set to determine which features contribute most significantly to the predictive power of the model. For instance, models like the LS model, LSM-HCC, and LSPS incorporate variables such as age, sex, HBV DNA, LSM, and spleen diameter, demonstrating a focused selection of features tailored to the specific study population and objectives.\n\nIn summary, the number of input features (f) can range from three to eight, depending on the model. Feature selection is commonly performed using the training set to ensure that the most relevant and predictive variables are included in the final model.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in our study utilized a gradient-boosting machine approach, which is particularly effective for handling a large number of parameters relative to the number of training points. This method is designed to build an ensemble of decision trees in a sequential manner, where each new tree aims to correct the errors of the previous ones. This iterative process helps in capturing complex patterns in the data without overfitting, as the model's complexity is controlled by the number of trees and the learning rate.\n\nTo rule out overfitting, we implemented several strategies. First, we used cross-validation techniques to ensure that the model's performance was consistent across different subsets of the data. This involved splitting the data into training and validation sets multiple times and averaging the results to get a more reliable estimate of the model's performance. Additionally, we employed regularization techniques, such as limiting the depth of the trees and setting a minimum number of samples required to split an internal node, to prevent the model from becoming too complex and fitting the noise in the data.\n\nUnderfitting was addressed by carefully tuning the hyperparameters of the model. We experimented with different numbers of trees, learning rates, and tree depths to find the optimal configuration that balanced bias and variance. Furthermore, we ensured that the features used in the model were relevant and informative by performing feature selection and engineering steps. This helped in capturing the underlying patterns in the data without making the model too simplistic.\n\nIn summary, the gradient-boosting machine method, combined with cross-validation, regularization, and hyperparameter tuning, allowed us to effectively manage the risk of overfitting and underfitting, resulting in a robust and accurate prediction model for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with chronic hepatitis B infections.",
  "optimization/regularization": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/config": "Not applicable.",
  "model/interpretability": "The models discussed for predicting the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infections vary in their interpretability. Some models use straightforward integer scoring systems, making them transparent and easy to interpret. For instance, the REACH-B model assigns points based on factors like age, sex, ALT levels, HBeAg status, and HBV DNA levels. Similarly, the PAGE-B and AASL models use simple scoring systems that consider age, sex, platelet count, albumin levels, and the presence of cirrhosis. These models are advantageous because they provide clear, understandable criteria for risk stratification, which is beneficial for clinical practice.\n\nHowever, other models, such as those utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) like machine learning and deep learning, can be more opaque. These AI-based models often use complex algorithms that may not be easily interpretable. For example, a model constructed using the gradient-boosting machine method targets a large cohort of CHB patients and demonstrates high predictive power, but the internal workings of such models can be difficult to decipher. This lack of transparency can be a drawback in clinical settings where understanding the rationale behind predictions is crucial.\n\nIn summary, while some HCC risk prediction models offer clear, interpretable scoring systems, others, particularly those involving AI, may lack transparency. The choice between these models depends on the balance between predictive accuracy and the need for interpretability in clinical decision-making.",
  "model/output": "The model discussed in the publication is primarily focused on the prediction of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk, which is a classification task. It aims to categorize patients into different risk groups based on various factors. The models mentioned, such as the PAGE-B, REACH-B, CU-HCC, and others, use specific variables to calculate a score that classifies patients into low, intermediate, or high-risk categories for developing HCC. For instance, the REACH-B model assigns points based on age, sex, ALT levels, HBeAg status, and HBV DNA levels to determine the risk of HCC. Similarly, the CU-HCC model uses age, albumin levels, bilirubin levels, HBV DNA levels, and the presence of cirrhosis to classify risk. These models are designed to provide a simple integer score that can be easily used in clinical practice to predict the likelihood of HCC occurrence.\n\nThe use of artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning and deep learning, is also explored for enhancing the predictive power of these models. AI models can handle complex relationships between variables and may offer more precise predictions. However, the development of AI models is still in its early stages, and more research is needed to overcome potential errors and validate their effectiveness across different populations.\n\nIn summary, the models discussed are classification models that aim to predict the risk of HCC in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infections. They use various clinical and laboratory variables to classify patients into different risk categories, with the goal of improving prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment outcomes. The integration of AI is seen as a promising avenue for further enhancing the accuracy and reliability of these predictive models.",

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the HCC risk prediction models involved several methods to ensure their validity and reliability. Various studies compared and analyzed different models using large cohorts of patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infections. For instance, a 10-year follow-up study of 1,241 Korean patients compared the PAGE-B, REACH-B, mREACH-B, and LSM-HCC models, assessing their predictive performance over 3, 5, and 7 years. Another study validated the REACH-B, CU-HCC, GAG-HCC, PAGE-B, and mPAGE-B models in 986 Chinese patients, focusing on the models' discrimination and calibration. Additionally, a comparison of the AASL, RESCUE-B, PAGE-B, and mPAGE-B scores in 3,171 patients receiving both ETV and TDF was conducted, highlighting the predictive accuracy of these models over 3 and 5 years. These evaluations included the use of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and other statistical measures to assess the models' performance. Furthermore, the inclusion of artificial intelligence (AI) models, such as those using gradient-boosting machines, was evaluated for their predictive power compared to traditional models. The studies emphasized the need for validation across diverse populations and the importance of considering variables unrelated to antiviral drug use to enhance the models' applicability and reliability.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our evaluation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk prediction models, we primarily focused on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as a key performance metric. This metric was used extensively across various studies to compare the predictive power of different models. For instance, the mREACH-B score demonstrated higher AUC values compared to PAGE-B and LSM-HCC models at 3, 5, and 7 years. Similarly, the REACH-B model showed high discrimination and calibration, with pooled AUCs ranging from 0.68 to 0.81 for 5-year predictions. The AASL score also exhibited high predictive accuracy for 3- and 5-year HCC predictions, with AUC values of 0.818 and 0.816, respectively.\n\nIn addition to AUC, we considered other performance measures such as negative predictive values. For example, the LSPS model excluded future HCC with high negative predictive values (99.4\u2013100.0%) at 5 years when applying a cut-off value of 11. These metrics are representative of the literature, as AUC and negative predictive values are commonly used to evaluate the performance of predictive models in medical research.\n\nWe also highlighted the importance of validation studies that compare multiple models to find the most suitable one. These studies often report AUC values and other relevant metrics to assess the performance of different models in predicting HCC risk. By comparing these metrics, we aimed to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the various HCC risk prediction models available for patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infections.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we conducted a comprehensive comparison of various hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk prediction models to evaluate their performance and suitability for patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infections. Several models were analyzed, including PAGE-B, REACH-B, mREACH-B, LSM-HCC, AASL, RESCUE-B, CU-HCC, GAG-HCC, and others. These models were validated using different cohorts and datasets, allowing for a robust comparison.\n\nOne of the key comparisons involved the mREACH-B score, which demonstrated higher predictive performance for HCC at 3, 5, and 7 years compared to PAGE-B and LSM-HCC models. This was evident in a 10-year follow-up study of 1,241 Korean patients with CHB. Similarly, a study involving 986 Chinese patients with CHB infections using entecavir (ETV) validated models like REACH-B, CU-HCC, GAG-HCC, PAGE-B, and mPAGE-B, showing generally acceptable predictive power with pooled AUCs ranging from 0.68 to 0.81 for 5-year predictions.\n\nAnother significant comparison was made in a study of 3,171 patients receiving both ETV and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), where the AASL score showed the highest predictive accuracy for 3- and 5-year HCC predictions. However, it is important to note that this study was conducted in the same region where the AASL model was developed, which may limit the generalizability of the results.\n\nIn addition to these models, we also explored the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in HCC risk prediction. A model using the gradient-boosting machine method was developed and validated on both Korean and Caucasian patients, showing better predictive power than traditional models like PAGE-B, REACH-B, and CU-HCC.\n\nWhile simpler baselines were not explicitly mentioned in our comparisons, the use of models like REACH-B, PAGE-B, and AASL, which employ simple integer scoring systems, indicates an effort to balance complexity and practicality. These models have shown satisfactory results in terms of predictive power, making them useful for clinical practice.\n\nOverall, our study highlights the importance of validating and comparing different HCC risk prediction models to identify the most suitable and reliable methods for predicting HCC in patients with CHB infections. The inclusion of AI and machine learning techniques shows promise for future developments in this field.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the HCC risk prediction models presented in this publication includes various performance metrics, such as the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) and the Area Under the Curve (AUC). These metrics are crucial for assessing the predictive power of the models.\n\nThe AUROC values are often accompanied by confidence intervals, which provide a range within which the true AUROC value is likely to fall. For instance, the LS model, developed using patients with CHB infections in Korea, reported an AUROC of 0.806 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.738\u20130.874. This indicates a suitable value for the HCC risk prediction model and provides a measure of the confidence in this estimate.\n\nStatistical significance is also considered in the evaluation of these models. For example, the mREACH-B score showed higher performance in predicting HCC compared to the PAGE-B and LSM-HCC groups at various time points, with AUC values that were statistically significant. This suggests that the mREACH-B score is superior in predicting HCC risk over these time frames.\n\nAdditionally, the validation studies conducted on different cohorts, such as Korean and Chinese patients with CHB infections, provide further evidence of the models' performance. The REACH-B model, for instance, demonstrated high discrimination and calibration, with a pooled AUC of 0.75 for 5-year prediction and a 3-year Brier score of 0.066. These results indicate that the model has a good balance between sensitivity and specificity, making it a reliable tool for predicting HCC risk.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics used in this publication are robust and include confidence intervals where applicable. The results are statistically significant, supporting the claim that certain models, such as mREACH-B and REACH-B, are superior in predicting HCC risk compared to others. This provides a strong foundation for the models' validity and reliability in clinical practice.",
