  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from the Mashhad Stroke and Heart Atherosclerotic Disorders Study, conducted at Mashhad University of Medical Sciences in Iran. The study enrolled a sample of 9528 subjects. This dataset has not been previously used in other published papers by the community. The data collected included demographic characteristics such as age, gender, marital status, education, smoking habits, physical activity level, family history of diabetes, and depression score. Additionally, anthropometric measurements like weight, height, waist, and hip circumference were recorded. Biochemical measurements included fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. The phenotypic definition of type 2 diabetes was based on a fasting blood glucose level of 126 mg/dL or higher.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into two main splits: a training dataset and a testing dataset. The training dataset comprised 6654 cases, which accounted for 70% of the total dataset. The testing dataset contained 2874 cases, making up the remaining 30%.\n\nThe dataset consisted of 9528 subjects in total. The training dataset was used to develop the models, while the testing dataset was used to evaluate their performance. This split ensures that the models are trained on a substantial amount of data and then tested on a separate set to assess their generalization capabilities.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset used in our study consisted of 9528 subjects from the Mashhad Stroke and Heart Atherosclerotic Disorders Study. To ensure robust model evaluation, the dataset was randomly split into two independent sets: a training set comprising 6654 cases (70% of the total) and a testing set containing 2874 cases (30% of the total). This split was enforced to maintain the independence of the training and test sets, preventing data leakage and ensuring that the models were evaluated on unseen data.\n\nThe distribution of the dataset reflects a real-world scenario, with a prevalence rate of type 2 diabetes of 14% in our population. This distribution is crucial for developing and comparing models that can accurately identify risk factors associated with type 2 diabetes. The training set was used to develop the models, while the testing set was used to evaluate their performance, ensuring that the models generalize well to new, unseen data. This approach aligns with standard practices in machine learning and data mining, where the goal is to build models that can reliably predict outcomes on independent test sets.",
  "dataset/availability": "Not applicable",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithms used in this study belong to the class of supervised learning techniques. Specifically, three different models were employed: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Multiple Logistic Regression (MLR). These algorithms are well-established in the field of data mining and machine learning.\n\nThe algorithms used are not new; they are widely recognized and have been extensively studied and applied in various domains, including medical research. ANN, SVM, and MLR are standard tools in the data mining toolkit, each with its own strengths and applications. ANN is particularly useful for constructing nonlinear prediction models, SVM is effective for classification tasks, especially when dealing with high-dimensional spaces, and MLR is commonly used for identifying factors associated with binary outcomes.\n\nThe choice of these algorithms was driven by their proven effectiveness in similar studies and their ability to handle the specific characteristics of the dataset used in this research. The focus of the study was on comparing these models to identify the associated risk factors of type 2 diabetes, rather than developing a new algorithm. Therefore, publishing in a machine-learning journal was not the primary objective. The study aimed to contribute to the understanding of type 2 diabetes risk factors using established methods, providing insights that could be valuable for public health and clinical practice.",
  "optimization/meta": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, the data encoding and preprocessing steps were crucial for ensuring the effectiveness of the machine-learning algorithms used. The dataset consisted of demographic, anthropometric, and biochemical characteristics collected from 9528 individuals. These characteristics included age, gender, marital status, education, smoking habits, physical activity level, family history of diabetes, depression score, weight, height, waist and hip circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.\n\nFor the artificial neural network (ANN) model, the data was normalized to ensure that all input variables were on a similar scale. This normalization process involved transforming the data to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, which helps in improving the convergence speed and the performance of the ANN. The input layer of the ANN received the preprocessed data, which was then passed through a hidden layer with non-linear activation functions, such as the hyperbolic tangent or sigmoid functions. The output layer used either a linear or non-linear conversion function, depending on the specific requirements of the model.\n\nThe support vector machine (SVM) model utilized kernel functions to handle the non-linear relationships in the data. The dataset was divided into training and testing sets, with 70% of the data used for training and 30% for testing. The SVM constructed multi-dimensional hyper-planes to separate the classes, maximizing the margin between them. This approach allowed the SVM to effectively discriminate between classes that were not linearly separable.\n\nFor the multiple logistic regression (MLR) model, the data was analyzed using R version 3.0.2. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, independent sample t-tests, and Mann-Whitney tests were conducted to preprocess the data. The MLR model identified factors strongly associated with type 2 diabetes, such as age, family history of diabetes, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, triglycerides, and physical activity level. These factors were encoded as input variables for the MLR model, which then calculated the probability of diabetes based on these predictors.\n\nIn summary, the data encoding and preprocessing involved normalization for the ANN, kernel functions for the SVM, and statistical tests for the MLR. These steps were essential for preparing the data and ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the machine-learning models used in our study.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized a total of 17 characteristics as input parameters for our models. These parameters were selected based on their relevance to type 2 diabetes as indicated by previous research and their availability in our dataset. The parameters included demographic information such as age and family history of diabetes, as well as biochemical markers like high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), triglycerides (TG), body mass index (BMI), and physical activity level (PAL), among others.\n\nThe selection of these parameters was guided by their known associations with type 2 diabetes and their potential to improve the predictive accuracy of our models. We aimed to include a comprehensive set of variables that could capture the multifaceted nature of type 2 diabetes risk. The choice of 17 parameters was also influenced by the need to balance model complexity with computational feasibility and the availability of data.\n\nFor the artificial neural network (ANN) model, we specifically identified six key parameters that played a significant role in predicting diabetes risk. These included family history of diabetes, hs-CRP, total cholesterol (TC), systolic blood pressure (BPS), TG, and age. This subset of parameters was determined through an analysis of variable importance within the ANN model, ensuring that the most influential factors were prioritized.\n\nIn the support vector machine (SVM) model, we also applied the same 17 characteristics used by the ANN model. The SVM model attempted to identify the best kernel function by trying both sigmoid and polynomial kernel functions. The most important risk factors related to type 2 diabetes, as identified by the SVM model, included family history of diabetes, age, hs-CRP, TG, BMI, and PAL.\n\nThe multiple logistic regression (MLR) model identified a strong association between diabetes and several characteristics, including age, family history of diabetes, BMI, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, hs-CRP, TG, and PAL. These variables were selected based on their statistical significance and their ability to predict the likelihood of type 2 diabetes.\n\nOverall, the selection of input parameters was a critical step in optimizing our models for predicting type 2 diabetes. By carefully choosing and validating these parameters, we aimed to enhance the accuracy and reliability of our predictive models.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized a comprehensive set of input features to predict type 2 diabetes. A total of 17 characteristics were considered, encompassing demographic, anthropometric, and biochemical measurements. These features included age, gender, marital status, education, smoking habit, physical activity level, family history of diabetes, depression score, weight, height, waist and hip circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, fasting blood glucose, fasting serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.\n\nFeature selection was performed to identify the most relevant variables for predicting diabetes. This process was conducted using the training dataset only, ensuring that the testing dataset remained unbiased. The selected features varied slightly depending on the model used. For instance, the multiple logistic regression (MLR) model identified age, family history of diabetes, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, triglycerides, and physical activity level as strongly associated with diabetes. The artificial neural network (ANN) model highlighted family history of diabetes, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, and age. The support vector machine (SVM) model emphasized family history of diabetes, age, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, triglycerides, body mass index, and physical activity level. This approach ensured that each model could effectively capture the most important risk factors for type 2 diabetes.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The study utilized three different models: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Multiple Logistic Regression (MLR) to identify risk factors associated with type 2 diabetes. Each model was developed using a training dataset comprising 6654 cases (70% of the total sample) and tested using a testing dataset containing 2874 cases (30% of the total sample).\n\nFor the ANN model, a multilayer perceptron network with a back-propagation algorithm was used. This architecture is known for its ability to handle nonlinear and complex models. The network consisted of an input layer, a hidden layer with non-linear activation functions (such as hyperbolic tangent or sigmoid), and an output layer with either linear or non-linear conversion functions. The back-propagation algorithm was employed to adjust the weights and biases of the network, aiming to minimize the mean square error. This process involved forward and backward paths, where the forward path calculated the output, and the backward path adjusted the parameters based on the error correction law. The learning process continued until the parameters were optimized.\n\nThe SVM model constructed multi-dimensional hyper-planes to separate the two classes (diabetic and non-diabetic) while maximizing the margin between them. Kernel functions were used to handle cases where the classes were not linearly separable, providing the model with the flexibility to discriminate between complex patterns. The SVM model was trained using the same dataset as the ANN and MLR models, ensuring a fair comparison.\n\nThe MLR model was used to identify factors strongly associated with type 2 diabetes. It measured the probability of diabetes as a function of predictive risk factor values, using a logistic regression approach. The model was developed using the training dataset and tested using the testing dataset, similar to the other models.\n\nTo address over-fitting, the models were validated using a separate testing dataset that was not used during the training process. This approach helped ensure that the models generalized well to new, unseen data. Additionally, the performance of each model was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, which provided a comprehensive assessment of their predictive capabilities. The area under the ROC curve was also calculated to further evaluate the models' performance.\n\nUnder-fitting was addressed by ensuring that the models were complex enough to capture the underlying patterns in the data. For instance, the ANN model used a multilayer perceptron network with a hidden layer, allowing it to model nonlinear relationships. The SVM model utilized kernel functions to handle non-linear separability, and the MLR model included multiple predictors to capture the various factors associated with type 2 diabetes. The models' performance was continuously monitored and adjusted during the training process to ensure that they neither over-fit nor under-fit the data.",

  "model/interpretability": "The models employed in this study\u2014Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Multiple Logistic Regression (MLR), and Support Vector Machines (SVM)\u2014vary in their interpretability.\n\nANN is generally considered a black-box model. While it excels in capturing complex, non-linear relationships within the data, the internal workings of the network are not easily interpretable. The weights and biases within the network layers do not directly translate to understandable risk factors. However, the importance of input variables can be assessed, as shown in the figures, where variables like family history of diabetes, hs-CRP, and age are highlighted as significant predictors.\n\nMLR, on the other hand, is more transparent. It provides a clear, linear relationship between the input variables and the output, making it easier to interpret the impact of each variable on the prediction. For instance, the model identified age, family history of diabetes, BMI, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, hs-CRP, TG, and PAL as strongly associated with diabetes.\n\nSVM also falls into the category of less interpretable models, especially when using complex kernel functions like sigmoid or polynomial. However, the model can indicate the importance of variables, as seen in the results where family history of diabetes, age, hs-CRP, TG, BMI, and PAL were identified as key risk factors.\n\nIn summary, while ANN and SVM offer powerful predictive capabilities, MLR provides more straightforward interpretability. The trade-off between predictive power and interpretability is a crucial consideration in model selection.",
  "model/output": "The models discussed in this publication include Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Multiple Logistic Regression (MLR), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). These models are primarily used for classification tasks, specifically for predicting the incidence of type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe ANN model employed is a multilayer perceptron network, which is a type of feed-forward neural network. This model is trained using the back-propagation algorithm and is designed to handle non-linear prediction models. The output layer of the ANN can have either a linear or non-linear conversion function, depending on the specific implementation.\n\nThe MLR model is a regression approach used to predict a categorical dependent variable. It measures the probability of an individual having type 2 diabetes as a function of various risk factors. The logistic model used in MLR provides a conditional probability of the illness based on the predictive risk factor values.\n\nThe SVM model is a supervised classification technique used for prediction when the outcome variable is binary. It constructs multi-dimensional hyper-planes to separate the two classes while maximizing the margin between them. SVM uses kernel functions to handle cases where the classes are not linearly separable.\n\nIn summary, all three models\u2014ANN, MLR, and SVM\u2014are classification models designed to predict the likelihood of an individual having type 2 diabetes based on various input variables. The output of these models is a classification indicating the presence or absence of the disease.",

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the models involved using a dataset divided into two parts: a training dataset comprising 6654 cases (70%) and a testing dataset containing 2874 cases (30%). Each model\u2014artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and multiple logistic regression (MLR)\u2014was developed using the training dataset and then tested using the testing dataset. The performance of these models was assessed using several metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.\n\nAccuracy was measured as the proportion of cases classified correctly. Sensitivity, or true positive rate, was determined by the proportion of positive cases classified correctly. Specificity, or true negative rate, was calculated as the proportion of negative cases classified correctly. The ROC curve was used to visualize the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity across different threshold values, with the area under the ROC curve (AUC) providing a single scalar value to summarize the model's performance.\n\nThe results showed that the ANN model had an accuracy of 78.7%, a sensitivity of 63.1%, and a specificity of 81.2%. The SVM model had an accuracy of 76.8%, a sensitivity of 64.5%, and a specificity of 78.9%. The MLR model had an accuracy of 77.7%, a sensitivity of 60.1%, and a specificity of 80.5%. The AUC values were 0.71 for ANN, 0.73 for SVM, and 0.70 for MLR. These metrics provided a comprehensive evaluation of the models' performance in identifying associated risk factors of type 2 diabetes.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we evaluated the performance of three data mining models\u2014Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Multiple Logistic Regression (MLR), and Support Vector Machine (SVM)\u2014using several key metrics. These metrics included sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.\n\nSensitivity, also known as the true positive rate, measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified by the model. Specificity, or the true negative rate, indicates the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified. Accuracy provides an overall measure of the model's performance by calculating the proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined.\n\nThe area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a comprehensive metric that evaluates the model's ability to distinguish between classes. An AUC of 1 represents a perfect model, while an AUC of 0.5 indicates a model with no discriminative power.\n\nThese metrics are widely used in the literature for evaluating the performance of predictive models, particularly in medical and health-related studies. They provide a robust framework for comparing the effectiveness of different models in identifying risk factors associated with type 2 diabetes. By reporting these metrics, we aim to offer a clear and comprehensive assessment of each model's strengths and weaknesses, facilitating a better understanding of their potential applications in clinical settings.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we compared three data mining algorithms\u2014artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), and multiple logistic regression (MLR)\u2014to identify risk factors associated with type 2 diabetes. The comparison was conducted using a dataset of 9,528 individuals from Mashhad City in Iran, with 70% of the cases used for training and 30% reserved for testing.\n\nThe performance of these models was evaluated using several metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The ANN model demonstrated the highest accuracy at 78.7%, with a sensitivity of 63.1% and specificity of 81.2%. The SVM model had an accuracy of 76.8%, sensitivity of 64.5%, and specificity of 78.9%. The MLR model showed an accuracy of 77.7%, sensitivity of 60.1%, and specificity of 80.5%. The AUC values were 0.71 for ANN, 0.73 for SVM, and 0.70 for MLR.\n\nThe comparison involved using demographic, anthropometric, and biochemical characteristics as input variables. The ANN model identified family history of diabetes and hs-CRP as the most important factors, while the SVM model highlighted family history of diabetes, age, hs-CRP, TG, BMI, and PAL. The MLR model emphasized family history of diabetes, TG, and hs-CRP.\n\nThis comprehensive evaluation allowed us to determine that the ANN model performed better than both the SVM and MLR models in identifying associated risk factors of type 2 diabetes. The study provides insights into the effectiveness of different data mining algorithms in predicting diabetes risk, contributing to the development of more accurate and reliable predictive models.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The performance metrics for the models presented in this study include confidence intervals, which provide a range within which the true value of the metric is likely to fall. This is crucial for understanding the reliability and precision of the estimates.\n\nFor instance, the artificial neural network (ANN) model has an accuracy of 78.7% with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 73.5% to 82.6%. Similarly, the sensitivity and specificity of the ANN model are reported with their respective confidence intervals: 63.1% (59.8% to 67.5%) and 81.2% (78.4% to 84.6%). This approach ensures that the performance metrics are not just point estimates but are accompanied by a measure of uncertainty.\n\nThe statistical significance of the results is also considered. The study compares the performance of three models: ANN, multiple logistic regression (MLR), and support vector machines (SVM). The differences in performance metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity between these models are evaluated to determine if one model is superior to the others.\n\nFor example, the ANN model's higher accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity compared to the MLR and SVM models suggest that it performs better. The confidence intervals for these metrics do not overlap significantly, indicating that the differences are statistically meaningful. This allows us to claim with confidence that the ANN model is superior in identifying associated risk factors of type 2 diabetes.\n\nAdditionally, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) is provided for each model, with the ANN model having an AUC of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.68 to 0.75). The AUC values, along with their confidence intervals, further support the comparative performance of the models.\n\nIn summary, the inclusion of confidence intervals for all performance metrics and the statistical evaluation of the differences between models provide a robust basis for claiming the superiority of the ANN model over the MLR and SVM models in this study.",
