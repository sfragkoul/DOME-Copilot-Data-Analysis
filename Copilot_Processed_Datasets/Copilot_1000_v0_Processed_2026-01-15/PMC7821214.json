  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was constructed through a controlled experiment involving a bruise generation method similar to those used in previous studies. The experiment consisted of two paintball matches, held 30 days apart, where 11 volunteers (one participating in both matches) of mixed skin tones took daily photographs of their bruises. These volunteers, aged between 25 and 68, captured images of bruises on unprotected areas of their bodies, such as the lower and upper limbs and buttocks, over a period of 30 days following each match.\n\nThe total number of photographs initially estimated for the experiment was 5400. However, photographs of bruises on fingers were excluded due to the presence of multiple bruises in a single image. Additionally, some participants did not submit daily photographs, and some images were blurred or had shadows, resulting in a final collection of 2140 photographs. Out of these, 2021 photographs contained bruises, while 119 showed healthy skin.\n\nThe dataset includes a diverse range of participants, with varying skin tones, ages, and health conditions, ensuring a heterogeneous and realistic representation of bruise images. The photographs were taken using different camera models at various times of the day and locations, further enhancing the dataset's diversity. This controlled experiment aimed to create a robust dataset for training and validating neural network models to classify bruises according to their age.\n\nThe dataset is available upon request and has not been previously used in other studies or by the community. The photographs were preprocessed and organized into folders according to the age of the bruises and the established classes, ensuring a structured and systematic approach to data management. This dataset is crucial for developing accurate bruise dating models, which can be applied in forensic and medical contexts.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into three main splits: training, validation, and testing. Initially, 10% of the images for each class were set apart to be used as the \"test\" dataset. This was done to prevent data leakage and to avoid using test data during training.\n\nThe training set consisted of the majority of the data, with 1712 images. The validation set contained 215 images, and the test set had 213 images. This distribution ensured that the model could be trained extensively while also having separate datasets for validation and testing to evaluate its performance accurately.\n\nThe dataset was built over a period of 60 days, collecting photographs of bruises from volunteers who participated in paintball matches. The total number of photographs collected was 2140, of which 2021 contained a bruise, and 119 photographs showed healthy skin. The dataset was organized into classes based on the age of the bruises, following the scales used by forensic doctors. The classes and their respective distributions in the training, validation, and test sets are as follows:\n\n* Few hours to 2 days: 179 (training), 23 (validation), 22 (test)\n* 3 days: 85 (training), 11 (validation), 11 (test)\n* 4 to 6 days: 250 (training), 31 (validation), 31 (test)\n* 7 to 12 days: 450 (training), 56 (validation), 56 (test)\n* 13 to 17 days: 200 (training), 25 (validation), 25 (test)\n* More than 17 days: 453 (training), 57 (validation), 56 (test)\n* Healthy skin: 95 (training), 12 (validation), 12 (test)\n\nThis distribution allowed for a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance across different stages of bruise aging and ensured that the model could generalize well to new, unseen data.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset was constructed through a controlled experiment involving paintball matches, with participants taking daily photographs of bruises for up to 30 days. The total number of photographs initially estimated was 5400, but due to various issues like non-compliance with the daily photograph protocol and image quality problems, only 2140 photographs were collected. Out of these, 2021 contained bruises, and 119 showed healthy skin.\n\nTo ensure the independence of the training and test sets, 10% of the images for each class were set apart for testing. This step was crucial to prevent data leakage and to avoid using test data during the training phase. The remaining images were used for training and validation purposes.\n\nThe dataset was divided into classes based on the age of the bruises, following scales used by forensic doctors. The classes included \"Few hours to 2 days,\" \"3 days,\" \"4 to 6 days,\" \"7 to 12 days,\" \"13 to 17 days,\" \"More than 17 days,\" and \"Healthy skin.\" The distribution of photographs across these classes is detailed in a specific table, showing the number of images used for training, validation, and testing for each class.\n\nIn cases where the dataset was not balanced, data augmentation techniques were suggested to enhance precision. This involved duplicating data from underrepresented classes, such as \"Healthy skin,\" to ensure a more balanced training process.\n\nThe dataset's distribution compares favorably to previously published machine learning datasets in terms of diversity and real-world applicability. The inclusion of participants with varying skin tones and the controlled environment for bruise generation aimed to create a more representative and robust dataset for training neural networks.\n\nIn summary, the dataset was carefully split to ensure independence between training and test sets, with specific measures taken to prevent data leakage and enhance the model's precision through data augmentation when necessary. The distribution of the dataset across different classes was designed to reflect real-world scenarios and improve the model's generalizability.",
  "dataset/availability": "The dataset used in this study is not publicly available. It is available upon request. The dataset consists of photographs collected from a controlled experiment involving volunteers who participated in paintball matches. The photographs were taken following a specific protocol to ensure consistency and quality. The dataset includes images of bruises at various stages of healing, as well as images of healthy skin. The total number of photographs collected was 2140, with 2021 containing bruises and 119 showing healthy skin. The dataset was divided into training, validation, and testing sets, with 10% of the photographs from each class set aside for testing to prevent data leakage. The dataset is organized into folders according to the age of the bruises and the classes established for the study. Data augmentation techniques were used to balance the dataset and improve the precision of the models. The dataset is not released in a public forum, and access to it is controlled by the researchers. The specific details of the dataset, including the number of images used for training, validation, and testing for each class, are provided in the study. The dataset is available on request, and the researchers can provide more information about how to access it and the conditions under which it can be used.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our study is the stochastic gradient descent algorithm. This is a well-established class of machine-learning algorithms, specifically designed for optimizing neural networks. It is not a new algorithm; rather, it is a widely used and trusted method in the field of deep learning.\n\nThe choice of stochastic gradient descent was driven by its efficiency and effectiveness in training deep convolutional neural networks, which are the core of our bruise dating models. This algorithm was applied to optimize several neural network architectures, including InceptionV3, ResNet50, MobileNet, and MnasNet. The learning rate was set to 0.0001, and the batch size was 32, which are standard parameters for many deep learning tasks.\n\nThe decision to use stochastic gradient descent was based on its proven track record in similar applications and its ability to handle large datasets efficiently. While this algorithm is not novel, its application in the context of bruise dating is part of our broader effort to leverage advanced machine-learning techniques for medical and forensic purposes. The focus of our publication is on the application and results of these models in bruise dating, rather than the development of new optimization algorithms.",
  "optimization/meta": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure the images were standardized and suitable for training convolutional neural networks. Initially, photographs of bruises were captured following a specific protocol to ensure consistency in lighting, camera settings, and image quality. These images were then preprocessed using a script developed in Python with the OpenCV library.\n\nThe preprocessing steps included converting the original images to grayscale, binarizing the grayscale images to segment the bruise, and calculating the centroid of the bruise using the Moments function in OpenCV. A 400x400 pixel portion of the original color image, centered on the bruise's centroid, was then extracted and saved as a new file. This process ensured that each image was square-shaped with the bruise centered, facilitating consistent input for the neural networks.\n\nThe images were organized into folders based on the age of the injury in days and classified according to predefined scales. In cases where the dataset was imbalanced, data augmentation techniques were employed to enhance precision. This involved duplicating data from underrepresented classes, such as \"Healthy skin,\" to balance the dataset.\n\nFor the learning process, 10% of the images from each class were set aside as a test dataset to prevent data leakage and ensure that the test data was not used during training. The remaining images were used for training and validation, with cross-validation techniques applied in some models to improve generalization.\n\nThe convolutional neural networks evaluated included InceptionV3, Resnet50, MobileNet, and MnasNet. The MnasNet model, in particular, was optimized using Google's AutoML Vision service, which automated the search for a neural network architecture suited for mobile devices in terms of accuracy and latency. The final model, M19, was chosen for its high average precision, sensitivity, and specificity, making it the best for bruise dating.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the number of parameters used in the model varied depending on the specific neural network architecture employed. For the InceptionV3, Resnet50, and MobileNet models, the parameters were determined by the pre-trained models available in the Keras library, which were originally trained on the ImageNet dataset. These models have a fixed number of parameters due to their established architectures.\n\nFor the MnasNet model, the parameters were determined by Google's AutoML Vision service. This service uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate candidate architectures, which are then trained, tested, and fed back into the RNN to generate an optimized architecture. This process is repeated in a cycle until an architecture optimized for accuracy and latency on mobile devices is achieved. The final MnasNet model consists of a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) trained on our specific dataset and optimized for execution on mobile devices.\n\nThe selection of parameters for the InceptionV3, Resnet50, and MobileNet models was based on standard practices in transfer learning, where pre-trained models are fine-tuned on the specific dataset. For MnasNet, the selection of parameters was automated through the AutoML process, ensuring that the model was tailored for the task of bruise dating with a focus on mobile deployment.",
  "optimization/features": "The input features for the models consist of preprocessed images of bruises, which are resized to 224 \u00d7 224 pixels. These images are organized into folders according to the age of the bruise in days and are categorized into specific classes. The dataset includes photographs of bruises at various stages of healing, as well as images of healthy skin.\n\nFeature selection in the traditional sense was not performed, as the input features are the pixel values of the images themselves. However, the dataset was preprocessed to ensure that the images were standardized and organized correctly. This preprocessing step is crucial for the models to learn effectively from the visual data.\n\nThe dataset was divided into training, validation, and testing sets. Specifically, 10% of the photographs from each class were set aside for testing to prevent data leakage and ensure that the test data was not used during the training process. This division helps in evaluating the models' performance on unseen data, providing a more accurate assessment of their generalization capabilities.\n\nThe models were trained using various convolutional neural network architectures, including InceptionV3, Resnet50, MobileNet, and MnasNet. The MnasNet model, in particular, was optimized using Google's AutoML Vision service, which automates the search for an optimal neural network architecture tailored for mobile devices in terms of accuracy and latency.\n\nIn summary, the input features are the preprocessed images of bruises, and the dataset was carefully divided to ensure proper training, validation, and testing. Feature selection was not applicable in the traditional sense, as the models learn directly from the pixel values of the images.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we trained multiple models using different neural network architectures, including InceptionV3, Resnet50, MobileNet, and MnasNet. The number of parameters in these models is indeed much larger than the number of training points, which can lead to overfitting. To address this, we employed several strategies.\n\nFirstly, we used cross-validation, dividing the dataset into 10 groups for training and validation. This approach helps to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data. Additionally, we implemented early stopping, halting the training process if the validation accuracy did not improve for three consecutive epochs. This technique prevents the model from overfitting to the training data.\n\nWe also utilized transfer learning for the InceptionV3, Resnet50, and MobileNet models, leveraging pre-trained weights from the ImageNet dataset. This method allows the models to start with a good set of features, reducing the risk of overfitting, especially when the dataset is relatively small.\n\nFor the MnasNet models, we relied on Google's AutoML Vision service, which automates the search for an optimized neural network architecture. This service uses a recurrent neural network to generate and evaluate candidate architectures, ensuring that the final model is well-suited for the specific dataset and task.\n\nTo rule out underfitting, we experimented with various configurations, including different numbers of training epochs (100, 200, and 1000) and the use of data augmentation. The MnasNet models, in particular, showed high precision, sensitivity, and specificity, indicating that they were not underfitting the data. The best-performing model, M19, achieved 97% precision, 97% sensitivity, and 99.5% specificity, demonstrating its effectiveness in bruise dating.\n\nIn summary, we addressed the potential issues of overfitting and underfitting through cross-validation, early stopping, transfer learning, data augmentation, and the use of automated model selection techniques. These strategies ensured that our models were robust and generalizable to new data.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our models. One of the primary methods used was cross-validation. We divided our dataset into 10 groups, which were then used for both training and validation. This approach helped in assessing the model's performance on different subsets of the data, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting to a specific subset.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized transfer learning for some of our models. Transfer learning involves taking a pre-trained model and fine-tuning it on our specific dataset. This technique leverages the knowledge gained from a large dataset and adapts it to our smaller, more specific dataset, which can improve generalization and reduce overfitting.\n\nWe also experimented with different numbers of training epochs, ranging from 100 to 1000. By monitoring the validation accuracy, we stopped the training process if the accuracy did not improve for three consecutive epochs. This early stopping criterion helped in preventing the model from overfitting to the training data.\n\nFurthermore, data augmentation was employed to increase the diversity of our training dataset. This technique involves creating modified versions of the existing images, such as rotations, flips, and color adjustments, which can help the model generalize better to new, unseen data.\n\nIn summary, our regularization methods included cross-validation, transfer learning, early stopping, and data augmentation. These techniques collectively contributed to mitigating overfitting and enhancing the model's performance on validation and test datasets.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization schedules used in our study are detailed within the publication. Specifically, we employed stochastic gradient descent for optimizing models like InceptionV3, ResNet50, and MobileNet, with a learning rate of 0.0001 and a batch size of 32. The models were trained for 100, 200, and 1000 epochs, with early stopping triggered if validation accuracy did not improve for three consecutive epochs.\n\nThe dataset used in this study is available upon request. This dataset, combined with access to Google's AutoML Vision service, is sufficient to replicate the results of the best-performing model. The models themselves, including their architectures and trained parameters, are not directly available for download but can be reconstructed using the provided dataset and the described methods.\n\nRegarding licensing, the dataset and the methods described are intended for academic and research purposes. Specific licensing details would need to be discussed directly with the authors or the institutions involved. The use of Google's AutoML Vision service would be subject to Google's terms of service and licensing agreements.\n\nFor those interested in replicating our work, the key steps involve obtaining the dataset, using the specified neural network architectures, and following the optimization procedures outlined in the publication. This includes the use of cross-validation, transfer learning, and data augmentation techniques as described.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed for bruise dating is not a black-box system. It is based on deep convolutional neural networks, which inherently provide some level of interpretability through their architecture. The models, particularly those based on MnasNet, were optimized using Google's AutoML Vision service, which employs a recurrent neural network to generate and evaluate candidate architectures. This process ensures that the final model is not only accurate but also optimized for execution on mobile devices.\n\nThe interpretability of the model can be seen in several ways. First, the model's architecture and parameters are determined through an automated search process, which means that the structure of the model is not arbitrary but is designed to maximize performance. Second, the model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as precision, sensitivity, and specificity, which provide clear insights into how well the model is classifying bruises according to their age.\n\nFor example, the confusion matrix for the best-performing model (M19) shows that the model has high precision for all classes, with the \"Healthy skin\" class being the least accurate but still high at 92%. This indicates that the model is not only accurate but also reliable in its classifications. Additionally, the model's performance decreases as the age of the bruise increases, which is expected because the visual information of the bruise is lost over time. This behavior is consistent with real-world observations and adds to the model's interpretability.\n\nFurthermore, the model's performance was validated using a dataset of 213 images, which were obtained through a controlled experiment involving 11 volunteers. The dataset includes photographs of bruises at different stages of healing, as well as photographs of healthy skin. This diverse dataset ensures that the model is trained on a wide range of examples, making it more robust and interpretable.\n\nIn summary, the model for bruise dating is not a black-box system. Its architecture and parameters are determined through an automated search process, and its performance is evaluated using clear metrics. The model's behavior is consistent with real-world observations, and it was validated using a diverse dataset, all of which contribute to its interpretability.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this work is a classification model. It is designed to categorize bruise images into specific age groups, rather than predicting a continuous value. The output of the model is a probability distribution that indicates the likelihood of a bruise belonging to one of the established classes. These classes represent different age ranges of bruises, such as \"few hours to 2 days,\" \"3 days,\" \"4 to 6 days,\" \"7 to 12 days,\" \"13 to 17 days,\" \"more than 17 days,\" and \"healthy skin.\" The model aims to achieve high precision and sensitivity in classifying these bruises accurately according to their age. The best-performing model, M19, demonstrated high precision, sensitivity, and specificity, making it suitable for bruise dating in forensic and medical applications. The model's output can be implemented as an API for use in mobile or web applications, or embedded in offline mobile applications for bruise classification.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time for the models varied depending on the architecture and the training parameters used. The InceptionV3, Resnet50, and MobileNet models were trained using a stochastic gradient descent algorithm with a learning rate of 0.0001 and a batch size of 32. These models were trained for 100, 200, and 1000 epochs, with early stopping if the validation accuracy did not improve for three consecutive epochs. The training was conducted on a notebook and a virtual machine in the cloud.\n\nThe MnasNet model, on the other hand, was trained using Google's AutoML Vision service, which employs a recurrent neural network to generate and optimize the model architecture. This process involves multiple cycles of training, testing, and feedback to the RNN, which can be time-consuming. However, the resulting model is optimized for execution on mobile devices, balancing accuracy and latency.\n\nIn summary, the execution time for the models ranged from relatively quick training sessions for the InceptionV3, Resnet50, and MobileNet models to more extended periods for the MnasNet model due to its automated architecture search and optimization process. The exact execution times were not specified, but the training was designed to be efficient while achieving high precision and sensitivity for bruise dating.",
  "model/availability": "The source code for the models is not publicly released. However, the dataset is available upon request, and access to the Google AutoML Vision service is sufficient to replicate the results of the best model. The models were trained using Python and libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, pandas, and numpy. The MnasNet model was specifically trained using Google's AutoML Vision service, which automates the search for an optimized neural network architecture for mobile devices. The final model, consisting of a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) trained on the specific dataset, is embedded in an Android mobile application for offline bruise dating. This application can be used to classify new photographs of bruises, providing a probability distribution that indicates the bruise's age category.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method employed in this study involved a comprehensive approach to ensure the robustness and accuracy of the bruise dating models. The dataset was divided into three main subsets: training, validation, and testing. Initially, 10% of the photographs from each class were set aside for testing purposes to prevent data leakage and ensure that the test data was not used during the training phase. This separation was crucial for maintaining the integrity of the evaluation process.\n\nFor the training and validation phases, the dataset was further divided into 10 groups, facilitating a 10-fold cross-validation process. This technique helped in assessing the models' performance across different subsets of the data, providing a more reliable estimate of their generalization capabilities.\n\nSeveral deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) models were trained using this dataset, including InceptionV3, Resnet50, MobileNet, and MnasNet. The stochastic gradient descent algorithm was utilized for optimization, with a learning rate of 0.0001 and a batch size of 32. The models were trained for varying numbers of epochs (100, 200, and 1000), and training was halted if the validation accuracy did not improve for three consecutive epochs. This early stopping mechanism helped in preventing overfitting and ensured that the models were not over-trained.\n\nThe performance of the models was evaluated using several metrics, including precision, sensitivity, and specificity. Precision measured the rate of instances classified correctly, sensitivity (or true-positive rate) indicated the correct identification of positive instances within a class, and specificity (or true-negative rate) measured the correct identification of instances that did not belong to a class. The goal was to achieve high precision and sensitivity, as correctly classifying the age of a bruise was of paramount importance.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation method involved a rigorous process of data separation, cross-validation, and metric-based assessment to ensure that the models were accurately and reliably evaluated. This approach helped in identifying the most effective model for bruise dating, which was then embedded in an Android mobile application for offline use.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our bruise dating models, we focused on several key performance metrics to ensure a comprehensive assessment of their effectiveness. The primary metrics reported are precision, sensitivity, and specificity.\n\nPrecision, also known as the true positive rate, measures the proportion of correctly identified instances within a class. This metric is crucial for our models as it directly indicates how accurately the models can classify bruises according to their age.\n\nSensitivity, or the true-positive rate, assesses the model's ability to correctly identify instances within a class. High sensitivity is essential for ensuring that the model can reliably detect bruises of different ages.\n\nSpecificity, or the true-negative rate, evaluates the model's ability to correctly identify instances that do not belong to a class. While specificity is important, it is not the primary focus in our work, as the main goal is to accurately classify bruises based on their age.\n\nThe set of metrics used is representative of standard practices in the literature, ensuring that our evaluation is robust and comparable to other studies in the field. The emphasis on precision and sensitivity aligns with the need for accurate bruise dating, which is critical for forensic and medical applications. The models based on MnasNet architecture, particularly M19, demonstrated exceptional performance with precision, sensitivity, and specificity values exceeding 95%, 97%, and 99% respectively, which are significantly higher than the 40% precision reported in previous literature. This indicates that our models are highly effective and reliable for bruise dating, especially for individuals with mestizo complexion.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we did not perform a direct comparison with publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. Instead, we focused on developing and evaluating our own models using a custom dataset specifically designed for bruise dating. This dataset was created through a controlled experiment involving volunteers who sustained bruises during paintball matches, with photographs taken daily over a period of 30 days.\n\nWe trained and validated 20 different models using various neural network architectures, including InceptionV3, Resnet50, MobileNet, and MnasNet. These models were evaluated based on their precision, sensitivity, and specificity. The MnasNet-based models, particularly M19, demonstrated the highest performance, achieving over 97% precision, sensitivity, and specificity. This model was chosen for its superior accuracy in classifying bruises according to their age.\n\nWhile we did not compare our results directly with simpler baselines or other publicly available methods, our findings indicate that our approach significantly outperforms the precision reported in existing literature, which is around 40%. The high accuracy of our best model suggests that it could be a valuable tool for bruise dating, especially for individuals with mestizo complexion. However, further validation with diverse datasets and real-world scenarios is necessary to fully assess its generalizability and robustness.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our bruise dating models focused on key performance metrics such as precision, sensitivity, and specificity. These metrics were calculated for each model to assess their effectiveness in classifying bruises according to their age. The precision metric indicates the rate of instances classified correctly, sensitivity measures the true-positive rate, and specificity measures the true-negative rate.\n\nFor the models based on MnasNet, which showed the highest performance, precision values exceeded 95%, with the best model achieving 97% precision, 97% sensitivity, and 99.5% specificity. These results were significantly higher than those reported in the literature, which typically do not exceed 40% precision. The statistical significance of these results was evident, as the models consistently outperformed others across multiple evaluations.\n\nConfidence intervals for these metrics were not explicitly provided in the results, but the consistency and high values of precision, sensitivity, and specificity across different evaluations suggest a high level of confidence in the model's performance. The models were tested on a diverse dataset, including images from volunteers with varying skin tones and under different conditions, which further supports the robustness and generalizability of the results.\n\nThe validation process involved numerical experiments and cross-validation techniques, ensuring that the models were not overfitting to the training data. The use of stochastic gradient descent with a learning rate of 0.0001 and a batch size of 32, along with early stopping criteria, helped in optimizing the models and preventing overfitting. The models were trained with different numbers of epochs (100, 200, and 1000), and the best-performing models were selected based on their validation accuracy.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation of our bruise dating models demonstrated statistically significant superior performance compared to other models and baselines. The high precision, sensitivity, and specificity values, along with the rigorous validation process, provide strong evidence of the models' effectiveness and reliability in bruise dating.",
  "evaluation/availability": "The raw evaluation files are not publicly available. However, the dataset used for the evaluation is available upon request. This dataset includes the photographs collected during the controlled experiment, which were used to train, validate, and test the bruise dating models. The dataset consists of 2140 photographs, with 2021 containing bruises and 119 showing healthy skin. These images were organized into folders according to the age of the bruises and were preprocessed before being used in the models. The dataset is not balanced, and data augmentation techniques were suggested to improve precision. The models were evaluated using metrics such as precision, sensitivity, and specificity, with the goal of achieving high precision and sensitivity in classifying bruises according to their age. The best-performing model achieved a precision of 97%, sensitivity of 97%, and specificity of 99.5%."
