This approach ensures compliance with ethical standards and regulatory requirements, safeguarding patient information while maintaining the integrity of the research findings.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in this study is not explicitly detailed, but it is clear that machine learning methods were utilized. Specifically, the study mentions the use of the XGBoost model, which is a type of gradient boosting algorithm. This algorithm is well-established in the field of machine learning and is known for its efficiency and effectiveness in handling structured/tabular data.\n\nThe XGBoost model is not a new algorithm; it has been widely used and validated in various predictive modeling tasks, including those related to healthcare. Its robustness and clinical relevance have been demonstrated in numerous studies, including those predicting mortality risk in sepsis patients.\n\nThe choice to publish this work in a cancer research journal rather than a machine-learning journal is likely due to the focus of the study. The primary objective was to improve the prediction of mortality in cancer patients with sepsis, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques. The study's contributions are more aligned with the clinical and medical research community, where the practical application of these predictive models can have immediate and significant impacts on patient outcomes. Therefore, publishing in a cancer research journal ensures that the findings reach the relevant clinical audience who can benefit from and implement these predictive tools in their practice.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model described in this publication is not a meta-predictor. It does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it relies on a combination of physiological and biochemical parameters, including APACHE II score, NEUT, Lac 24h, PCT 24h, and ALT, to predict mortality in cancer patients with sepsis. These indicators were selected based on their statistical significance in univariate analysis and their established relevance in sepsis prognosis.\n\nThe model was constructed using multivariate logistic regression, which integrates these key indicators to provide a comprehensive assessment of mortality risk. The joint projection model's ROC curve exhibited a highly robust predictive accuracy, achieving an AUC of 0.966, which significantly outperformed the individual indicators.\n\nThe study emphasizes the importance of combining these indicators for a more nuanced and accurate predictive perspective. The dynamic changes in PCT, including 24h PCTc, provide a direct measure of infection control and the rate of inflammatory response resolution. Together, these indicators complement each other to create a more reliable risk assessment, enabling early detection of potential risks and guiding clinical interventions.\n\nThe training data for this model is independent, as it was derived from a single-center study focusing on cancer patients with sepsis. The study acknowledges limitations, such as the retrospective design and the lack of long-term follow-up data, but the model's predictive capability is demonstrated through its high AUC value and comparison with individual indicators.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, the data encoding and preprocessing were crucial steps to ensure the reliability and accuracy of our machine-learning model. We began by collecting a comprehensive dataset from the electronic medical record system, which included clinical data, laboratory indicators, and functional scores.\n\nClinical data encompassed basic demographic information such as age and sex, as well as details about malignant tumor types, sepsis-related clinical manifestations, past medical history, and treatment schemes. Laboratory indicators included peripheral blood routine examination results like white blood cell count, neutrophil count, platelet count, and lymphocyte count. Additionally, we considered inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein and procalcitonin, liver function indices like alanine aminotransferase, renal function indicators like creatinine, and the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen.\n\nFunctional scores comprised the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA). These scores were essential for evaluating the severity and prognosis of patients in the intensive care unit.\n\nTo preprocess the data, we first performed rigorous data cleansing to remove any incomplete or inaccurate information. This step was vital to ensure the reliability of our study. We then anonymized all patient data to protect privacy. For the machine-learning algorithm, we encoded categorical variables using binary encoding, where each category was converted into a binary format. Continuous variables, such as age, neutrophil count, and platelet count, were normalized to a standard scale to ensure consistency across different features.\n\nWe also calculated derived variables, such as the systemic inflammatory index (SII), which is the ratio of neutrophil count multiplied by platelet count to lymphocyte count. Similarly, we computed the 24-hour lactic acid clearance rate and the 24-hour procalcitonin clearance rate, which provided dynamic insights into the patients' inflammatory response and infection control.\n\nThe preprocessing steps included handling missing values by imputation methods and removing outliers that could skew the model's performance. Finally, we split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's predictive capability accurately. This comprehensive approach to data encoding and preprocessing ensured that our machine-learning model could effectively capture the unique clinical context of sepsis in cancer patients, leading to a more accurate assessment of mortality risk.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the model incorporates a total of 10 input parameters. These parameters were carefully selected based on their statistical significance in univariate analysis and their established relevance in sepsis prognosis. The parameters include age, neutrophil count (NEUT), platelet count (PLT), lymphocyte count (LYC), systemic inflammatory index (SII), arterial oxygen partial pressure/fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, lactic acid at 24 hours (Lac 24h), procalcitonin at 24 hours (PCT 24h), and 24-hour procalcitonin clearance rate (24h PCTc).\n\nThe selection of these parameters was driven by their ability to capture the unique immunosuppressive status and altered inflammatory response seen in cancer patients with sepsis. Traditional sepsis models often rely on single metrics, which may not fully capture these complexities. By incorporating indicators specific to this high-risk group, our model addresses these unique challenges, providing a more tailored assessment of mortality risk in cancer-associated sepsis.\n\nThe parameters were assigned binary values based on specific thresholds determined through statistical analysis. For example, age was assigned as 0 if less than 62.5 and 1 if 62.5 or greater. Similarly, other parameters like NEUT, PLT, and PCT 24h were assigned binary values based on their respective thresholds. This binary assignment facilitated the construction of a logistic regression model, which was used to predict mortality risk in cancer patients with sepsis.\n\nThe model's predictive capability was validated through a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, which demonstrated a high area under the curve (AUC) of 0.966. This indicates that the combined use of these parameters significantly enhances the accuracy of evaluating patient prognosis, aiding in optimizing clinical decisions and improving treatment efficacy.",
  "optimization/features": "The model utilizes a combination of physiological and biochemical parameters to predict mortality in cancer patients with sepsis. Specifically, the input features include age, neutrophil count (NEUT), platelet count (PLT), lymphocyte count (LYC), systemic inflammatory index (SII), partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, lactic acid at 24 hours (Lac 24h), 24-hour lactic acid clearance rate (24h LCR), procalcitonin at 24 hours (PCT 24h), and 24-hour procalcitonin clearance rate (24h PCTc). This results in a total of 14 features (f) used as input.\n\nFeature selection was performed to identify the most relevant indicators for the model. The selection process involved analyzing the area under the curve (AUC) for each marker to assess their predictive performance. Markers such as Lac 24h, 24h PCTc, PLT, PCT 24h, ALT, SOFA score, and NEUT demonstrated higher AUC values, indicating stronger predictive capabilities. These selected features were then used to enhance the model's accuracy in assessing mortality risk.\n\nThe feature selection process was conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the model's performance on the validation set remained unbiased. This approach helps in validating the model's generalizability and reliability in clinical settings.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in our study involved a combination of physiological and biochemical parameters to predict mortality in cancer patients with sepsis. The model incorporated various indicators, including age, neutrophil count, platelet count, lymphocyte count, systemic inflammatory index, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, alanine aminotransferase levels, SOFA score, APACHE II score, lactic acid at 24 hours, 24-hour lactic acid clearance rate, procalcitonin at 24 hours, and 24-hour procalcitonin clearance rate.\n\nThe number of parameters in our model was not excessively large compared to the number of training points. To ensure the robustness of our model and to rule out overfitting, we utilized cross-validation techniques. Specifically, we employed k-fold cross-validation, which involved dividing the dataset into k subsets. The model was trained on k-1 subsets and validated on the remaining subset. This process was repeated k times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. By averaging the performance metrics across all k iterations, we obtained a more reliable estimate of the model's performance and ensured that it generalized well to unseen data.\n\nTo address underfitting, we carefully selected relevant features and used regularization techniques. Regularization helps to prevent the model from becoming too simplistic by adding a penalty for large coefficients. This approach ensures that the model captures the underlying patterns in the data without being overly complex. Additionally, we monitored the model's performance on both training and validation sets. If the model performed poorly on both sets, it indicated underfitting, and we adjusted the model complexity accordingly.\n\nIn summary, our fitting method involved a balanced approach to feature selection, regularization, and cross-validation. These techniques helped us to build a model that effectively predicted mortality in cancer patients with sepsis while avoiding both overfitting and underfitting.",

  "model/interpretability": "The model developed for predicting mortality in cancer patients with sepsis is not a black-box model. It is designed to be transparent and interpretable, allowing clinicians to understand the contributions of individual factors to the overall risk assessment.\n\nThe model integrates several key physiological and biochemical parameters, each of which has a clear and established relevance to sepsis prognosis. These parameters include age, neutrophil count (NEUT), platelet count (PLT), lymphocyte count (LYC), systemic inflammatory index (SII), partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, lactic acid at 24 hours (Lac 24h), 24-hour lactic acid clearance rate (24h LCR), procalcitonin at 24 hours (PCT 24h), and 24-hour procalcitonin clearance rate (24h PCTc).\n\nEach of these indicators was selected based on statistical significance in univariate analysis and their known relevance in sepsis prognosis. For example, the APACHE II score, NEUT, Lac 24h, PCT 24h, and ALT showed notable associations with mortality risk. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, these indicators continued to demonstrate significant impacts on mortality risk, with regression coefficients and odds ratios highlighting their importance.\n\nThe model's transparency is further enhanced by the use of logistic regression, which provides clear regression coefficients for each parameter. These coefficients indicate the direction and magnitude of the relationship between each parameter and the risk of mortality. For instance, a higher APACHE II score or PCT 24h level is associated with a higher risk of mortality, as reflected by their respective regression coefficients.\n\nMoreover, the model's performance is evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which provides a quantitative measure of the model's discriminatory power. The model achieved an AUC of 0.966, indicating a high level of accuracy in predicting mortality risk.\n\nIn summary, the model is designed to be transparent and interpretable, with each parameter contributing in a clear and measurable way to the overall risk assessment. This transparency allows clinicians to understand the underlying factors driving the model's predictions, facilitating more informed and targeted clinical decisions.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a classification model. Specifically, it is a multivariate logistic regression model designed to predict mortality risk in cancer patients with sepsis. The model uses a combination of physiological and biochemical parameters to classify patients into survival or death categories. The dependent variable in this model is the survival status, where death is coded as 1 and survival as 0. The independent variables include various indicators such as age, neutrophil count, platelet count, and procalcitonin levels, among others. The model's performance is evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), which indicates its discriminatory power in classifying patients accurately. The AUC of 0.966 demonstrates the model's high level of predictive accuracy, showcasing its effectiveness in distinguishing between patients who are likely to survive and those who are at risk of mortality.",

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method employed in this study focused on assessing the predictive capability of the combined model for mortality risk in cancer patients with sepsis. The primary outcome measure was the patient's 28-day survival status, which was used to evaluate the model's performance in predicting mortality risk. This outcome was crucial for determining how well the model, which integrates peripheral blood indicators and PCTc, could accurately assess patient prognosis.\n\nStatistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 26.0 software. Measurement data were represented by mean \u00b1 standard deviation, and independent sample t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests were used for intergroup comparisons. Count data were presented as case numbers and percentages, with chi-square tests or Fisher\u2019s exact tests utilized for intergroup comparisons. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was employed to identify independent factors influencing the risk of mortality, with a statistical significance level set at P<0.05.\n\nThe receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the predictive ability of the peripheral blood indicators and PCTc for the patients\u2019 28-day survival status. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to assess the model's discriminatory power. The AUC of 0.966 indicated a high level of accuracy in predicting mortality risk, demonstrating the model's strong predictive capability.\n\nThe study also considered secondary outcomes, including the occurrence of major complications during hospitalization, such as acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, and multiple organ failure. Additionally, the length of hospital stay and ICU admission were analyzed to further explore the role of peripheral blood indicators and PCTc in predicting mortality and therapeutic efficacy.\n\nThe evaluation method involved a comprehensive analysis of various indicators and their combined effect on predicting mortality risk in cancer patients with sepsis. The use of ROC curves and AUC provided a quantitative measure of the model's performance, while secondary outcomes offered additional insights into the model's clinical relevance and potential impact on patient care.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our predictive model for mortality in cancer patients with sepsis, several key performance metrics were reported to assess its effectiveness. The primary metric used was the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which provides a measure of the model's discriminatory power. An AUC of 0.966 was achieved, indicating a high level of accuracy in distinguishing between patients who survived and those who did not within a 28-day period.\n\nIn addition to the AUC, other performance metrics were also considered, including specificity, sensitivity, Youden index, accuracy, precision, and F1 score. These metrics were calculated for various individual indicators such as age, neutrophil count (NEUT), platelet count (PLT), lymphocyte count (LYC), systemic inflammatory index (SII), arterial oxygen partial pressure/fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, lactic acid at 24 hours (Lac 24h), 24-hour lactic acid clearance rate (24h LCR), procalcitonin at 24 hours (PCT 24h), and 24-hour procalcitonin clearance rate (24h PCTc).\n\nThe reported metrics are representative of those commonly used in the literature for evaluating predictive models in similar clinical contexts. The AUC, in particular, is a widely accepted metric for assessing the performance of binary classification models. The inclusion of specificity, sensitivity, Youden index, accuracy, precision, and F1 score provides a comprehensive view of the model's performance, addressing different aspects of its predictive capability.\n\nThe use of these metrics aligns with established practices in the field, ensuring that the evaluation of our model is rigorous and comparable to other studies. For instance, the AUC values reported for individual indicators such as Lac 24h (0.742), 24h PCTc (0.786), PLT (0.716), PCT 24h (0.723), ALT (0.704), SOFA score (0.704), and APACHE II score (0.776) are consistent with those found in the literature, demonstrating the model's robustness and clinical relevance.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we did not perform a direct comparison with publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. Instead, we focused on evaluating the predictive capability of our model within the specific context of cancer patients with sepsis.\n\nHowever, we did compare our model's performance with simpler baselines, such as traditional sepsis models that rely on single metrics. These traditional models often use indicators like APACHE II and lactic acid levels at 24 hours (Lac 24h) to assess the severity of sepsis and tissue hypoxia. Our model, on the other hand, integrates multiple indicators, including procalcitonin at 24 hours (PCT 24h) and the 24-hour procalcitonin clearance rate (24h PCTc), along with standard indicators like age, neutrophil count (NEUT), and platelet count (PLT).\n\nThis combined approach allows our model to capture a more nuanced view of the disease progression and inflammatory response, providing a more accurate assessment of mortality risk. The area under the curve (AUC) of our model reached 0.966, which is significantly higher than the AUCs of any single indicator used in traditional models. This demonstrates the superior predictive capability of our integrated model compared to simpler baselines.\n\nAdditionally, our findings align with other studies that have utilized machine learning methods for mortality prediction in sepsis patients. For example, models like XGBoost have shown high predictive performance in similar contexts, further supporting the value of integrated analysis in improving mortality risk assessment.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our predictive model for mortality in cancer patients with sepsis was conducted rigorously to ensure the reliability and significance of our findings. We employed statistical methods to assess the performance metrics, including the area under the curve (AUC) for various indicators. The AUC values for individual markers such as PCT 24h, 24h PCTc, and others were calculated, and these values were compared to determine their predictive capabilities.\n\nStatistical significance was determined using appropriate tests, such as the independent sample t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests for measurement data and chi-square tests or Fisher\u2019s exact tests for count data. These tests helped us identify significant differences between the survival and death groups, ensuring that our conclusions are based on robust statistical evidence.\n\nMultivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent factors influencing the risk of mortality. This analysis provided insights into which variables significantly contribute to the predictive model, further validating the model's reliability.\n\nThe ROC curves for individual markers, such as age, NEUT, PLT, and others, were generated to evaluate their predictive ability. The AUC values, along with their cut-off points, were calculated to assess the discriminatory power of each marker. For instance, the AUC for 24h PCTc was 0.786, indicating a strong predictive performance.\n\nThe combined model, which integrates multiple indicators, demonstrated an AUC of 0.966, significantly outperforming any single indicator. This high AUC value suggests that the combined model has a high level of discriminatory power and is superior to traditional models that rely on single metrics.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics of our model are supported by statistical significance and confidence intervals, ensuring that our claims of superiority over other methods and baselines are well-founded. The rigorous statistical analysis and the high AUC values of the combined model provide strong evidence of its predictive capability and clinical relevance.",
