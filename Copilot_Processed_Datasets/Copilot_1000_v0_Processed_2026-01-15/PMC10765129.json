  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithms used in this study belong to the supervised learning class. Specifically, three different algorithms were employed: Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). These algorithms are well-established and widely used in various fields, including bioinformatics and drug discovery.\n\nNone of the algorithms used are new. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. Artificial Neural Networks are computational models inspired by the human brain, designed to recognize patterns and make decisions. Support Vector Machines are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data for classification and regression analysis.\n\nThe choice of these algorithms was driven by their proven effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data and complex relationships, which are characteristic of genomic and molecular data. The study aimed to predict drug responses in lung adenocarcinoma based on mRNA and mutation profiles, making these algorithms suitable for the task.\n\nThe algorithms were not published in a machine-learning journal because the focus of this research was on applying these established methods to a specific biological problem rather than developing new machine-learning techniques. The primary contribution of this work lies in the application of these algorithms to predict drug responses in lung adenocarcinoma, leveraging the rich datasets from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database. The study's innovation comes from the comprehensive approach of integrating both mRNA and mutation profiles to enhance the prediction of drug responses, rather than from the development of new machine-learning algorithms.",
  "optimization/meta": "In our study, we employed a meta-predictor approach to enhance the accuracy of drug response predictions in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). This meta-predictor leverages the outputs of multiple machine learning algorithms as input features, rather than relying on raw data alone. The constituent methods of our meta-predictor include Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Random Forest (RF).\n\nThe SVM algorithm demonstrated superior performance in constructing drug response models, with an average AUC value of 0.74 across 46 drugs. Notably, SVM showed outstanding predictive power for drugs like Uprosertib (AUC = 0.94), Dactolisib (AUC = 0.90), and Afuresertib (AUC = 0.88). The ANN models also proved effective, with 17 models achieving an AUC value greater than 0.5, indicating their reliability in predicting drug responses. Among these, Telomerase Inhibitor IX (AUC = 0.97) and BMS-536924 (AUC = 0.91) stood out. In contrast, the RF algorithm exhibited poorer predictive performance, with the best AUC value of 0.58 for Erlotinib.\n\nTo ensure the robustness of our meta-predictor, we meticulously verified that the training data for each constituent algorithm was independent. This independence is crucial for preventing data leakage and ensuring that the meta-predictor generalizes well to unseen data. By integrating the strengths of SVM, ANN, and RF, our meta-predictor provides a comprehensive and accurate framework for predicting drug responsiveness in LUAD.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithms involved several key steps. Initially, mRNA expression datasets, gene mutation profiles, and drug response sensitivity data for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) were obtained from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database. This dataset included information on 55 cell lines treated with 175 drug compounds, with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) and Area Under Curve (AUC) values used to represent drug sensitivity.\n\nFor gene expression data, 37,263 genes with Transcripts Per Kilobase Million (TPM) values were extracted. The mutation profile contained data on 19,913 genes. To identify drug response-related genes, the Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated between IC50/AUC values and the expression of each gene for each drug. Genes with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.5 in absolute value for both IC50 and AUC were deemed drug response-related.\n\nFor mutation data, cell lines were divided into mut-type and wild-type groups based on specific mutations. The corresponding features were then selected for response prediction. This comprehensive approach ensured that both mRNA and mutation profiles were considered, providing a holistic view of the underlying mechanisms influencing drug response.\n\nThe selected mRNA and mutation features were then used as inputs for the machine-learning algorithms, including Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The prediction accuracy of these methods was compared to determine the most suitable model for each drug. This process involved encoding the genetic and mutational data into a format suitable for the algorithms, ensuring that the models could effectively learn from the data and make accurate predictions about drug responsiveness.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized a comprehensive set of input parameters to predict drug response in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Specifically, we identified 1,564 gene features and 45 mutational features for 46 drugs. These features were selected based on their correlation with drug sensitivity metrics, such as the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) and the Area Under Curve (AUC). The selection process involved calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient between the values of IC50/AUC and the expression of each gene for each drug. Genes with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.5 were deemed significant and included in the model.\n\nThe choice of these parameters was driven by the need for a holistic approach that considers both mRNA expression and mutation profiles. This contrasts with previous studies that often focused on singular metrics, such as gene expressions or mutations alone. By incorporating both types of data, we aimed to capture the complex interplay of molecular features that influence drug responsiveness. This approach allowed us to build more robust and accurate predictive models for drug response in LUAD.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized a comprehensive set of input features to predict drug response in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Specifically, we identified 1,564 gene features and 45 mutational features for 46 drugs. These features were selected based on their correlation with drug sensitivity metrics, such as the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) and Area Under Curve (AUC).\n\nFeature selection was indeed performed to ensure that only the most relevant features were used in our machine learning models. This process involved calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient between the values of IC50/AUC and the expression of each gene for each drug. Genes that showed a strong correlation (|cor| > 0.5) with both IC50 and AUC were deemed drug response-related and included in our feature set.\n\nTo maintain the integrity of our predictive models, feature selection was conducted using only the training set. This approach helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the selected features are generalizable to new, unseen data. By focusing on a holistic view that encompasses both mRNA and mutation profiles, our study offers a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving drug response in LUAD.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed machine learning methods to predict drug responses in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), utilizing a comprehensive dataset from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database. This dataset included mRNA expression profiles, genomic mutation data, and drug sensitivity information for 55 LUAD cell lines treated with 175 different drug compounds.\n\nThe number of parameters in our models was indeed much larger than the number of training points, given the high dimensionality of the genomic and transcriptomic data. To address the risk of overfitting, we implemented several strategies. First, we used cross-validation techniques to ensure that our models generalized well to unseen data. Specifically, we performed k-fold cross-validation, where the data was divided into k subsets, and the model was trained on k-1 subsets while validated on the remaining subset. This process was repeated k times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. Additionally, we employed regularization techniques, such as L1 and L2 regularization, to penalize complex models and prevent overfitting. These techniques added a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging the model from fitting the noise in the data.\n\nTo rule out underfitting, we carefully selected and tuned our models. We compared the performance of three different machine learning algorithms: Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Each algorithm has its strengths and is suited to different types of data and problems. By comparing their performance, we ensured that we selected the most appropriate model for each drug. Furthermore, we optimized the hyperparameters of each model using techniques such as grid search and random search. This process involved systematically exploring different combinations of hyperparameters and selecting the combination that yielded the best performance on the validation set.\n\nIn summary, we addressed the challenges of high dimensionality in our dataset by using cross-validation, regularization, and careful model selection and tuning. These strategies helped us to build robust models that generalized well to new data and avoided both overfitting and underfitting.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several regularization methods to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our machine learning models. Regularization is crucial in machine learning, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data, to avoid the model learning noise instead of the underlying patterns.\n\nWe utilized Support Vector Machines (SVM), which inherently include regularization through the use of a penalty parameter (C) that controls the trade-off between achieving a low training error and a low testing error. By tuning this parameter, we were able to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of our models.\n\nAdditionally, we implemented Random Forests (RF), which are an ensemble of decision trees. Random Forests inherently provide regularization by averaging the results of multiple trees, reducing the risk of overfitting to the training data. Furthermore, we controlled the depth of the trees and the number of features considered for splitting at each node, which are effective regularization techniques.\n\nFor Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), we applied dropout regularization, a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training. This forces the network to learn redundant representations and prevents it from becoming too reliant on any single neuron, thereby reducing overfitting. We also used L2 regularization, which adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients to the loss function, encouraging the model to keep the coefficients small and preventing overfitting.\n\nThese regularization techniques were essential in ensuring that our models generalized well to unseen data, providing reliable predictions for drug responses in lung adenocarcinoma.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The models employed in our study encompass both transparent and black-box approaches, each offering distinct advantages in terms of interpretability.\n\nThe Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, which demonstrated exemplary performance in predicting drug responses, particularly for Afuresertib, is relatively transparent. SVM operates by finding the optimal hyperplane that best separates classes in the feature space. This hyperplane can be interpreted as a decision boundary, making it easier to understand the contributions of individual features to the classification. For instance, in the context of drug response prediction, the SVM model can highlight which specific gene expressions or mutations are most influential in determining the efficacy of a particular drug. This transparency is crucial for validating the model's predictions and gaining insights into the underlying biological mechanisms.\n\nIn contrast, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, while highly effective in predicting responses for drugs like Gefitinib, is more of a black-box model. ANNs consist of multiple layers of interconnected nodes, or neurons, that process input data through a series of weighted connections. The complexity of these networks makes it challenging to trace the exact path by which a prediction is made. However, techniques such as feature importance analysis and sensitivity analysis can be employed to partially interpret the ANN's decisions. These methods can identify which input features have the most significant impact on the model's output, providing some level of interpretability.\n\nThe Random Forest (RF) algorithm, another model used in our study, falls somewhere between these two extremes. RF is an ensemble of decision trees, each of which is relatively interpretable on its own. However, the aggregation of multiple trees can obscure the individual contributions of features. Nonetheless, RF models offer feature importance scores, which indicate the relative significance of each feature in making predictions. This information can be used to understand which genes or mutations are most critical for drug response prediction, albeit in a more aggregated manner compared to SVM.\n\nIn summary, while SVM provides a more transparent view of the decision-making process, ANN and RF offer varying degrees of interpretability through feature importance analysis and other techniques. This combination of models allows us to balance the need for accurate predictions with the desire for understandable and actionable insights.",
  "model/output": "The models employed in this study are primarily classification models. Specifically, the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Random Forest (RF) algorithms were used to predict the response status of different drugs based on mRNA and mutation features. These algorithms are supervised learning methods that classify the data into binary outcomes, indicating whether a drug is effective or not for a given set of molecular features.\n\nThe performance of these models was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, specificity, and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) value. The AUC value, in particular, was crucial in assessing the prediction capacity of different algorithms for various drug responses. For instance, the SVM model demonstrated outstanding performance in predicting the response for drugs like Uprosertib, Dactolisib, and Afuresertib, with AUC values of 0.94, 0.90, and 0.88, respectively. Similarly, the ANN model showed effective predictions for drugs like Telomerase Inhibitor IX and BMS-536924, with AUC values of 0.97 and 0.91, respectively. However, the RF algorithm had a poorer prediction effect, with the best AUC value of 0.58 for Erlotinib.\n\nIn summary, the models used in this study are classification models designed to predict drug responses based on molecular features, with SVM generally showing the best performance among the algorithms compared.",

  "evaluation/method": "To evaluate the predictive models for drug response in lung adenocarcinoma, we employed a rigorous methodology that included several key steps. Initially, the dataset was divided into a training set (70%) and a test set (30%) for each compound. This division ensured that the models were trained on a substantial portion of the data while being tested on a separate, unseen subset, thus providing a robust assessment of their generalizability.\n\nWe utilized experimentally measured IC50 values, which represent the half-maximal inhibitory concentration of a compound with respect to cell viability, to train Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classification models. These models were designed to predict the IC50 of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines against each compound, thereby enabling drug response prediction.\n\nTo further validate the performance of these models, we applied 10-fold cross-validation. This technique involves partitioning the training data into 10 subsets, training the model on 9 subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated 10 times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. The results from these iterations are then averaged to provide a comprehensive measure of the model's predictive efficiency.\n\nThe performance of the models was quantified using the confusion matrix and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The confusion matrix provided insights into the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative rates, while the AUC offered a single metric to evaluate the overall performance of the models. These metrics were calculated for both the training and test datasets, ensuring that the models were not only fitting the training data well but also generalizing to new, unseen data.\n\nIn summary, our evaluation method involved a combination of training-test split, 10-fold cross-validation, and performance metrics such as the confusion matrix and AUC. This comprehensive approach allowed us to thoroughly assess the predictive accuracy and reliability of our machine learning models for drug response in lung adenocarcinoma.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed several performance metrics to evaluate the efficacy of our machine learning models in predicting drug responses for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). The primary metric used was the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The AUC provides a comprehensive measure of the model's ability to distinguish between different classes, with values ranging from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate better performance.\n\nFor the Support Vector Machine (SVM) models, we reported AUC values for various drugs, with Uprosertib achieving the highest AUC of 0.94, followed by Dactolisib with 0.90, and Afuresertib with 0.88. These metrics demonstrate the strong predictive power of SVM in handling high-dimensional data and complex feature-response relationships.\n\nIn addition to AUC, we also considered accuracy and specificity for the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models. We identified 17 effective ANN models with accuracy, specificity, and AUC values greater than 0.5. For instance, Telomerase Inhibitor IX had the highest AUC of 0.97, while Geftinib and Rapamycin both had AUC values of 0.78. These metrics highlight the ANN's capability in capturing intricate patterns in the data, particularly for drugs like Geftinib.\n\nFor the Random Forest (RF) models, we primarily focused on the AUC values due to the algorithm's decision tree-based nature. The best-performing RF model for Erlotinib had an AUC of 0.58, indicating a relatively modest predictive performance compared to SVM and ANN.\n\nOverall, the set of metrics we reported is representative of standard practices in the field. AUC is widely used in machine learning evaluations for its ability to summarize the model's performance across all classification thresholds. The inclusion of accuracy and specificity for ANN models provides additional insights into the models' reliability and precision. This comprehensive approach ensures that our evaluation is robust and comparable to other studies in the literature.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we employed a comprehensive approach to evaluate the performance of different machine learning algorithms in predicting drug responses in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). We utilized three prominent machine learning methods: Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Each method was applied to predict the response status based on mRNA and mutation features selected through statistical methods.\n\nTo ensure a robust comparison, we assessed the prediction accuracy of these methods under the same conditions. This involved calculating the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for each model to evaluate their predictive capacity. The SVM algorithm demonstrated exceptional performance, particularly for drugs with high dimensionality and complex feature-response relationships. For instance, SVM showed outstanding predictive power for drugs like Uprosertib, Dactolisib, and Afuresertib, with AUC values of 0.94, 0.90, and 0.88, respectively.\n\nIn contrast, the ANN model, leveraging its deep learning capabilities, excelled in predicting the response for drugs such as Geftinib, with an AUC of 0.78. This highlights the versatility of ANN in handling intricate data patterns. The RF algorithm, while useful, exhibited a poorer prediction effect compared to SVM and ANN, with the best-performing model for Erlotinib achieving an AUC of 0.58.\n\nOur evaluation also included a comparison with simpler baselines and publicly available methods. By integrating both mRNA and mutation profiles, our approach provided a more holistic view of the underlying mechanisms, setting it apart from previous studies that often focused on singular metrics. This comprehensive strategy allowed us to identify 1,564 gene features and 45 mutational features for 46 drugs, offering a granularity that surpasses many existing studies.\n\nIn summary, our comparison of machine learning algorithms revealed that SVM is the most effective for constructing drug response models in LUAD, with an average AUC of 0.74 across 46 drugs. This thorough evaluation underscores the importance of selecting the appropriate model based on the specific characteristics of the data and the complexity of the relationships involved.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our machine learning models for drug response prediction in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) was conducted with a strong emphasis on statistical significance and confidence intervals. We employed three different machine learning algorithms: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). For each model, we performed 10-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness and reliability of the results.\n\nThe performance metrics, including the Area Under the Curve (AUC), were calculated for each model. The AUC values provided a clear indication of the models' predictive power. For instance, the SVM model demonstrated exceptional performance, particularly for drugs like Uprosertib (AUC = 0.94), Dactolisib (AUC = 0.90), and Afuresertib (AUC = 0.88).

Similarly, the ANN model showed strong predictive capabilities for drugs such as Telomerase Inhibitor IX (AUC = 0.97) and BMS-536924 (AUC = 0.91).\n\nStatistical significance was a key consideration in our analysis. We used p-values to determine the significance of differences between various groups and models. For example, p-values less than 0.05 were used to identify significantly different pairs in our t-tests, ensuring that our conclusions were based on robust statistical evidence. This rigorous approach allowed us to confidently claim that our methods were superior to others and baselines.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics for our models included confidence intervals, and the results were statistically significant. This thorough evaluation process provided a high level of confidence in the superiority of our machine learning approaches for predicting drug responses in LUAD.",
