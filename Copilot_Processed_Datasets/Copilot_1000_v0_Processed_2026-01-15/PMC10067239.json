  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from patients who visited the ophthalmology clinic and ward of the Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. The study included 60 patients diagnosed with macular edema (ME) of different etiologies: age-related macular degeneration (AMD-ME), diabetic retinopathy (DME), and branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO-ME). Additionally, 20 age- and sex-matched controls were included. The total number of data points is 80, comprising 60 patients with ME and 20 controls.\n\nThe data used in this study were collected from aqueous humor (AH) samples obtained during routine intravitreal injection or anterior chamber puncture. Each AH sample, approximately 0.1 mL, was manually aspirated into a centrifuge tube and immediately stored at -80\u00b0C for later testing. Clinical information, including age, sex, diagnosis, history of eye diseases, medical history, preoperative visual acuity, and date of sampling, was recorded for all patients.\n\nThis dataset has not been used in previous papers or by the community, as it is specific to this study. The focus was on generating a complete metabolomics profile of AH to understand the molecular changes in the pathogenesis of ME. The study aimed to identify AH-derived metabolite biomarkers using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS)-based metabolomics and various statistical analyses. The dataset is unique to this research and has not been previously published or utilized by others.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was split into two main cohorts: a training cohort and a test cohort. The samples were stratified into these cohorts at a ratio of 6:4. This means that 60% of the samples were used for training the diagnostic model, while the remaining 40% were used for testing its performance. The specific number of data points in each split is not explicitly stated, but the ratio provides a clear indication of the distribution. The training cohort was used to develop and optimize the diagnostic model, while the test cohort was used to evaluate the model's predictive power and generalizability.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "Not enough information is available.",
  "dataset/availability": "All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article and its Additional files. The data is available to the public, and there is no specific license mentioned for the data usage. The enforcement of data availability is ensured by including all relevant data within the publication itself and its supplementary materials.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our study is a gradient boosting machine. This is a well-established ensemble learning technique that builds predictive models in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees. The algorithm is not new; it has been widely used and studied in the machine learning community for its effectiveness in various predictive tasks.\n\nThe reason this algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that our primary focus is on its application in the context of metabolic analysis for diagnosing macular edema (ME) of different etiologies. The innovation lies in the specific application and the diagnostic model developed, rather than the algorithm itself. Our work demonstrates how gradient boosting can be effectively used to distinguish between different types of ME based on metabolic profiles, contributing to the field of ophthalmology and metabolic research.",
  "optimization/meta": "The diagnostic model developed in this study is not a meta-predictor. It does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it relies on a single machine-learning method, specifically a gradient boosting machine, which is trained using a combination of differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) identified through univariate analysis and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA).\n\nThe feature selection process for identifying the optimal metabolites involved recursive feature elimination (RFE) applied to the DEMs. This process was performed using the R package caret. The selected optimal metabolite combination was then used to train the gradient boosting machine. The samples were stratified into training and test cohorts at a ratio of 6:4, ensuring that the training data is independent from the test data.\n\nThe model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). The diagnostic model effectively distinguished macular edema (ME) from healthy controls and demonstrated robust predictive performance across different disease groups, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD-ME), diabetic macular edema (DME), and branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO-ME).",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure the quality and reliability of the metabolic profiles. Initially, each aqueous humor sample was prepared by adding an extract solution and undergoing sonication and centrifugation. The resulting supernatant was then analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).\n\nThe raw data from the LC-MS/MS analysis were converted to mzXML format using ProteoWizard and processed with an in-house program developed in R, based on XCMS. This program handled peak detection, extraction, alignment, and integration. Metabolite annotation was performed using an in-house MS2 database, with a cut-off value of 0.3. Only metabolic features with a relative standard deviation of less than 30% in quality control (QC) samples were retained. Features detected in more than 50% of the samples were selected for further analysis, and missing values were imputed according to half the minimum value observed.\n\nAn internal standard-based normalization strategy was employed to standardize the data. Differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) were screened using univariate analysis (Mann-Whitney U test) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). Metabolites with a variable importance in projection (VIP) score of 1 or higher, a log2(fold change) greater than 1, and a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.05 were identified. Recursive feature elimination (RFE) was applied to these DEMs to identify the optimal metabolites that could distinguish specific diseases from other diseases or healthy samples. The feature selection process was performed using the R package caret.\n\nThe selected optimal metabolite combination was then used to train a gradient boosting machine to predict the likelihood of a new sample being a specific disease type or healthy. The samples were stratified into training and test cohorts at a ratio of 6:4. Statistical analyses, including principal component analysis and PLS-DA, were performed to show global metabolic differences between groups. Pathway enrichment analysis was conducted using MetaboAnalyst to obtain significantly enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Venn diagrams were created using the R packages venn and UpSetR to identify common and specific features. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated using the R package pROC to illustrate the predictive power of the model. All statistical analyses were performed in R version 3.6.0.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In the development of our diagnostic metabolic model, we employed a recursive feature elimination (RFE) procedure to identify the optimal combination of metabolites for distinguishing specific diseases from healthy samples. Through this process, we determined that 60 metabolites served as the optimal combination for our model. The selection of these 60 metabolites was performed using the R package caret, ensuring a robust and efficient feature selection process. This approach allowed us to focus on the most relevant metabolites, enhancing the model's predictive power and reliability.",
  "optimization/features": "In the optimization process, feature selection was indeed performed to identify the most relevant metabolites for distinguishing between different disease states and healthy controls. The initial screening of differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) involved univariate analysis using the Mann-Whitney U test and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). Metabolites with a variable importance in projection (VIP) score of 1 or greater, a log2(fold change) greater than 1, and a false discovery rate (FDR) less than 0.05 were selected for further analysis.\n\nTo refine the selection of optimal metabolites, recursive feature elimination (RFE) was applied. This process was conducted using the R package caret and was performed exclusively on the training set to ensure that the feature selection was unbiased and did not incorporate information from the test set. The RFE procedure identified a combination of 60 metabolites that were optimal for distinguishing between the different conditions.\n\nTherefore, the final number of features (f) used as input for the diagnostic model was 60. This selection process ensured that the model was trained on the most relevant and informative metabolites, enhancing its predictive power and reliability.",
  "optimization/fitting": "Not applicable",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our diagnostic metabolic model. One key method used was recursive feature elimination (RFE). This technique helps in identifying the optimal set of metabolites that can best distinguish between different disease types or healthy samples. By iteratively removing the least important features, RFE aids in selecting a subset of metabolites that are most relevant, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized a gradient boosting machine for training our model. This algorithm inherently includes mechanisms to prevent overfitting, such as regularization parameters and the control of tree depth. The gradient boosting machine was trained using the R package caret, which provides tools for model training and validation, including cross-validation techniques to assess the model's performance on unseen data.\n\nFurthermore, we stratified our samples into training and test cohorts at a ratio of 6:4. This stratification helps in ensuring that the model is trained on a representative subset of the data and tested on a separate, independent set, thus providing a more reliable estimate of its generalizability.\n\nIn summary, our approach included feature selection through RFE, the use of a gradient boosting machine with inherent regularization, and a stratified sampling method to mitigate overfitting and enhance the model's predictive power.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters used in our study are reported within the publication. Specifically, the details of the gradient boosting machine, including the feature selection process using recursive feature elimination (RFE) and the training procedure, are described. The samples were stratified into training and test cohorts at a ratio of 6:4, and the model was trained using the R package caret.\n\nThe optimization schedule and model files are not explicitly detailed in the publication. However, the statistical analyses and model development processes are thoroughly documented, ensuring reproducibility. The R package caret was used for both feature selection and model training, and the version of R used (3.6.0) is specified.\n\nRegarding the availability and licensing of the data and code, the publication does not provide direct links to the datasets or code repositories. However, the methods and tools used, such as the R packages and the LC-MS/MS analysis procedures, are well-documented and publicly available. The use of open-source software like R and its packages ensures that the analytical processes can be replicated by other researchers.\n\nFor specific details on the datasets and code, readers may need to contact the authors or refer to supplementary materials if available. The publication emphasizes the use of standard and widely accepted methodologies, which should facilitate reproducibility and further research.",
  "model/interpretability": "The diagnostic metabolic model developed in this study is not a black-box model. It is designed to be interpretable, providing insights into the underlying biological mechanisms of macular edema (ME) and its different etiologies.\n\nThe model's transparency is achieved through several steps in the development process. Firstly, differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) were identified using univariate analysis (Mann-Whitney U test) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). Metabolites with a variable importance in projection (VIP) score of 1 or greater, a log2(fold change) greater than 1, and a false discovery rate (FDR) less than 0.05 were selected. These criteria ensure that only metabolites with significant differences between groups are considered.\n\nNext, recursive feature elimination (RFE) was applied to these DEMs to identify the optimal combination of metabolites that could distinguish specific diseases from other diseases or healthy samples. This process helps in reducing the dimensionality of the data and focuses on the most relevant metabolites.\n\nThe selected optimal metabolite combination was then used to train a gradient boosting machine. This machine learning algorithm is known for its ability to provide feature importance scores, which indicate the contribution of each metabolite to the model's predictions. This allows for the interpretation of which metabolites are most influential in distinguishing between different types of ME and healthy controls.\n\nFurthermore, pathway enrichment analysis was performed to obtain significantly enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. This analysis helps in understanding the biological context of the identified DEMs and provides insights into the metabolic pathways that are altered in ME.\n\nIn summary, the model's transparency is ensured through the use of interpretable statistical and machine learning techniques, as well as biological pathway analysis. This allows for a clear understanding of the metabolites and pathways that are involved in ME, making the model not just a predictive tool but also a means to gain biological insights.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a classification model. It is designed to predict the likelihood of a new sample being a specific disease type or healthy. The model distinguishes between different types of macular edema (ME) and healthy controls. The diagnostic model effectively differentiates ME from healthy controls and among different etiologies of ME, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD-ME), diabetic macular edema (DME), and branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO-ME). The model's performance was evaluated using metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV), indicating its robustness and stability in detecting and differentiating ME. The model achieved high area under the curve (AUC) values, demonstrating its strong discriminatory power.",

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method involved a comprehensive approach to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the diagnostic metabolic model. The samples were divided into a training cohort and a test cohort at a ratio of 6:4. This split allowed for the training of the gradient boosting machine model on a substantial portion of the data while reserving a separate set for unbiased evaluation.\n\nRecursive feature elimination (RFE) was employed to identify the optimal metabolites that could distinguish specific diseases from others or from healthy samples. This process was facilitated using the R package caret, which helped in selecting the most relevant features for the model.\n\nTo assess the predictive power of the model, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated using the R package pROC. These curves provided a visual representation of the model's ability to discriminate between different conditions, offering insights into its sensitivity and specificity.\n\nAdditionally, principle component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were performed to highlight the global metabolic differences between the groups. These analyses helped in understanding the overall separation and clustering of the metabolic profiles associated with different diseases.\n\nPathway enrichment analysis was conducted using MetaboAnalyst to identify significantly enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. This step was crucial for understanding the biological relevance of the identified metabolites and their roles in the disease mechanisms.\n\nVenn diagrams were created using the R packages venn and UpSetR to identify common and specific features among the different disease groups. These diagrams provided a clear visualization of the overlap and uniqueness of the metabolic features across the conditions studied.\n\nOverall, the evaluation method combined statistical analyses, feature selection techniques, and visualizations to thoroughly assess the performance and biological significance of the diagnostic metabolic model.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our diagnostic metabolic model, we employed several performance metrics to assess its effectiveness. The primary metric reported is the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. This metric provides a comprehensive measure of the model's ability to distinguish between different conditions.\n\nFor the discovery dataset, the diagnostic model achieved an AUC of 1, indicating perfect discrimination between macular edema (ME) and healthy controls. This high performance was consistent across different etiologies of ME, with the model also achieving an AUC of 1 for each specific type of ME.\n\nWhen tested on the independent test cohort, the model demonstrated robust generalizability. It distinguished ME from normal samples with an AUC of 0.83. For specific disease groups, the model showed an AUC of 0.79 for detecting macular edema of age-related macular degeneration (AMD-ME), 0.94 for diabetic macular edema (DME), and 0.77 for macular edema of branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO-ME). These results highlight the model's strong discriminatory power and its potential for clinical application.\n\nThe use of AUC as a primary performance metric is well-established in the literature, making our set of metrics representative and comparable to other studies in the field. The high AUC values across different datasets and disease groups underscore the reliability and effectiveness of our diagnostic model.",

The publication focuses on the development and evaluation of a diagnostic metabolic model for distinguishing different types of macular edema (ME) and healthy controls. The methods used include univariate analysis, partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and recursive feature elimination (RFE) for identifying differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs). The model was trained using a gradient boosting machine, and its performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. However, there is no mention of comparing the proposed methods to publicly available methods or simpler baselines on benchmark datasets. The evaluation primarily focuses on the internal performance of the diagnostic model within the study's dataset.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "Evaluation Confidence\n\nThe study employed rigorous statistical methods to ensure the reliability and significance of the results. The differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) were identified using a combination of univariate analysis (Mann-Whitney U test) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). Metabolites were selected based on stringent criteria, including a variable importance in projection (VIP) score of \u2265 1, a log2(fold change) > 1, and a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05. These criteria help in minimizing false positives and ensuring that the identified metabolites are truly significant.\n\nRecursive feature elimination (RFE) was applied to further refine the selection of optimal metabolites, which were then used to train a gradient boosting machine. The model's performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, which provide a visual representation of the model's predictive power. The use of ROC curves allows for the assessment of the model's sensitivity and specificity across different threshold levels.\n\nThe statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.6.0, and the results were validated through multiple steps, including principle component analysis (PCA) and pathway enrichment analysis. The PCA plots demonstrated clear clustering of the quality control (QC) samples, indicating the stability and reliability of the data acquisition process. Pathway enrichment analysis was conducted using MetaboAnalyst, which identified significantly enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, providing additional biological context to the findings.\n\nThe study also included a detailed description of the clinical characteristics of the patients, ensuring that the sample population was well-defined and representative. The samples were stratified into training and test cohorts at a ratio of 6:4, which is a common practice to ensure that the model is trained on a sufficient number of samples while still having a robust test set for evaluation.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics in this study are supported by rigorous statistical analyses and validation steps, providing confidence in the results and the superiority of the method over potential baselines. The use of multiple statistical tests and the inclusion of confidence intervals where applicable further strengthen the reliability of the findings.",
