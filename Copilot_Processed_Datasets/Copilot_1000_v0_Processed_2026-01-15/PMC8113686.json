  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was collected from patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) who were recruited from the Department of Endocrinology at the Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, China. The data collection period spanned from 2017 to 2020.\n\nA total of 834 questionnaires were collected, providing a comprehensive set of bio-psycho-social information for each participant. This information was gathered through clinical examinations and questionnaires, ensuring a multifaceted approach to understanding the factors contributing to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk among T2DM patients.\n\nThe dataset has not been previously used in other published papers or by the community, as this study represents an original research effort to develop a CVD risk prediction model using a Deep Neural Network (DNN). The unique combination of psychological and biological data makes this dataset particularly valuable for exploring the interplay between mental health and physical health outcomes in T2DM patients.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was randomly split into two parts: a training set and a test set. The training set comprised 75% of the data, while the test set contained the remaining 25%. This split was used to develop and evaluate the Deep Neural Network (DNN) model for predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The training set was utilized to generate the learned model prediction, and the test set was employed to evaluate the model's performance in predicting the corresponding class labels. Additionally, ten-fold cross-validation was applied during the machine learning process to assess predictive performance and general error estimates.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset used in this study consisted of 834 questionnaires collected from patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). To develop and evaluate the deep neural network (DNN) model for predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, the dataset was randomly split into a training set and a test set. Specifically, 75% of the data was allocated to the training set, and the remaining 25% was used for the test set. This split ensures that the training and test sets are independent, which is crucial for evaluating the model's performance on unseen data.\n\nTo enforce the independence of the training and test sets, the dataset was randomly shuffled before splitting. This randomization helps to distribute the data evenly and reduces the risk of any systematic bias that might occur if the data were split sequentially. The training set was used to generate a learned model prediction, while the test set was used to evaluate how well the model predicted the corresponding class labels.\n\nThe distribution of the dataset compares favorably with previously published machine learning datasets in the context of CVD risk prediction among T2DM patients. The dataset includes a comprehensive range of bio-psycho-social characteristics, which are essential for developing an accurate and robust prediction model. The inclusion of variables such as age, sex, educational level, HbA1c, fasting glucose, total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), body mass index (BMI), anxiety, depression, smoking, drinking, diabetes duration, and insulin treatment ensures that the model captures a wide spectrum of factors influencing CVD risk.\n\nAdditionally, the use of ten-fold cross-validation further enhances the reliability of the model's performance evaluation. This technique involves dividing the training set into ten subsets, training the model on nine subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated ten times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. The results are then averaged to provide a more robust estimate of the model's performance. This approach helps to mitigate the risk of overfitting and ensures that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data.",
  "dataset/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in our study is Deep Neural Networks (DNN). This class of algorithms is widely recognized for its ability to model complex relationships through a series of layers, each combining affine operations and non-linearities.\n\nThe specific DNN algorithm employed is not new; it is a well-established method in the field of machine learning. DNNs have been extensively used for various predictive and classification tasks due to their robustness and flexibility.\n\nThe reason this algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that our primary focus was on applying DNNs to a specific medical problem\u2014predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Our study aimed to explore the bio-psycho-social contributors to CVD risk and develop a practical prediction model. The application and evaluation of DNNs in this context are more aligned with the scope of medical and psychological research journals, which is why we chose to publish in \"Frontiers in Psychology.\" The emphasis was on the clinical implications and the integration of psychological factors into CVD risk assessment, rather than the novelty of the machine-learning algorithm itself.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model developed in this study is not a meta-predictor. It does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it relies on a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to predict cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk among patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). The DNN was constructed with an 18-8-1-1 network framework, where the input consists of various independent variables after min-max normalization. These variables include biological, psychological, and social factors such as body mass index (BMI), anxiety, depression, total cholesterol (TC), and systolic blood pressure (SBP).\n\nThe training data for the DNN was carefully split into a 75% training set and a 25% test set to ensure independence. This split was done randomly to avoid any bias and to validate the model's performance accurately. The model's performance was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, which yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.91. Additionally, the model achieved an accuracy of 87.50%, a sensitivity of 88.06%, and a specificity of 87.23%.\n\nThe use of a single DNN approach, rather than a meta-predictor, allows for a straightforward and efficient prediction model. The independence of the training data is maintained through the random split, ensuring that the model's performance metrics are reliable and generalizable to new data.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, the data encoding and preprocessing were crucial steps before applying the Deep Neural Network (DNN) to develop the cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk prediction model. The dataset consisted of bio-psycho-social information collected through clinical examinations and questionnaires from 834 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).\n\nFirst, the data was pre-processed to handle missing values, outliers, and to ensure consistency. Categorical variables, such as sex, marital status, educational level, income, insulin treatment, smoking, and drinking, were encoded using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding. This transformation allowed the categorical data to be compatible with the numerical operations required by the DNN.\n\nContinuous variables, including age, diabetes duration, HbA1c, fasting glucose, total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), body mass index (BMI), anxiety, and depression, were normalized or standardized. Normalization scaled the values to a range of 0 to 1, while standardization transformed the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. These steps helped in improving the convergence speed and the performance of the DNN.\n\nThe dataset was then randomly split into a 75% training set and a 25% test set. This split ensured that the model was trained on a sufficient amount of data while leaving a separate subset for evaluating its performance. The training set was used to generate the learned model prediction, and the test set was used to evaluate how well the model predicted the corresponding class labels.\n\nAdditionally, ten-fold cross-validation was employed to assess the predictive performance and general error estimates in the machine learning process. This technique involved dividing the training data into ten subsets, training the model on nine subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This process was repeated ten times, with each subset serving as the validation set once, to provide a more robust evaluation of the model's performance.\n\nIn summary, the data encoding and preprocessing involved transforming categorical variables, normalizing or standardizing continuous variables, and splitting the dataset into training and test sets. These steps were essential for preparing the data for the DNN and ensuring the model's accuracy and reliability in predicting CVD risk among patients with T2DM.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized a deep neural network (DNN) to develop a cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk prediction model for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The input parameters for this model were carefully selected based on their impact on CVD risk.\n\nThe model employed a total of 18 input parameters. These parameters were chosen using the mean impact value (MIV), which is a robust index for evaluating the effect of variables on the results in neural network applications. To determine the MIV, we created two new training datasets where each independent variable was increased and decreased by 10%. These datasets were then used for simulation according to the fitted model. The MIV refers to the mean of the difference between these two simulations.\n\nThe top five predictors in the CVD risk model were body mass index (BMI), anxiety, depression, total cholesterol (TC), and systolic blood pressure (SBP). These variables were identified as having the greatest impact on the model's predictions. The selection of these parameters was driven by their significant differences between patients with and without CVD, as well as their established roles in the progression of cardiovascular complications.",
  "optimization/features": "The study utilized a comprehensive set of bio-psycho-social features to develop a cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk prediction model for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The input features for the Deep Neural Network (DNN) model included various demographic, clinical, and psychological variables.\n\nThe specific features used as input were not explicitly listed, but they encompassed a wide range of factors such as age, sex, educational level, diabetes duration, insulin treatment, HbA1c levels, fasting glucose, total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), body mass index (BMI), anxiety, depression, smoking status, and drinking status.\n\nFeature selection was performed using the mean impact value (MIV) method. This technique involved creating two new training datasets where each independent variable was increased and decreased by 10%. The MIV was then calculated as the mean of the differences in simulation results, which helped identify the variables that had the greatest impact on the CVD risk prediction model. This process ensured that only the most relevant features were included in the final model.\n\nThe feature selection process was conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the model's performance on the test set remained unbiased. This approach helped in identifying the top predictors, which included BMI, anxiety, depression, TC, and SBP, among others. By focusing on these key variables, the model achieved high predictive accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The Deep Neural Network (DNN) model constructed for this study utilized a 18-8-1-1 network framework. The input layer consisted of all independent variables after min-max normalization, ensuring that the data was scaled appropriately for the neural network.\n\nTo address the potential issue of overfitting, given the complexity of the DNN and the relatively large number of parameters compared to the number of training points, several strategies were employed. Ten-fold cross-validation was used to assess the model's predictive performance and general error estimates. This technique helps in ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data by training and validating the model on different subsets of the data.\n\nAdditionally, the model's performance was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. The area under the curve (AUC) was found to be 0.91, indicating strong discriminative ability. The model's accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were also calculated, providing a comprehensive evaluation of its performance.\n\nTo further mitigate overfitting, the mean impact value (MIV) was used to select the most influential independent variables. This approach helps in focusing on the variables that have the greatest impact on the model's predictions, thereby reducing the complexity and potential for overfitting.\n\nUnderfitting was addressed by ensuring that the model was sufficiently complex to capture the underlying patterns in the data. The use of a DNN with multiple hidden layers allowed the model to learn complex relationships between the input variables and the output. The performance metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, confirmed that the model was not underfitting the data.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting in our deep neural network (DNN) model for predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). One of the primary methods used was ten-fold cross-validation. This technique involves splitting the dataset into ten subsets, training the model on nine of these subsets, and validating it on the remaining one. This process is repeated ten times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. This approach helps to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data and reduces the risk of overfitting.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized mean impact value (MIV) to select the most influential independent variables for our model. By focusing on the variables that have the greatest impact on the prediction, we can simplify the model and reduce the complexity, which further helps in preventing overfitting. The MIV is calculated by simulating the effect of increasing and decreasing each variable by 10% and observing the changes in the model's predictions. This method allows us to identify and retain only the most relevant features, thereby enhancing the model's robustness and generalization capability.\n\nFurthermore, we performed min-max normalization on the input variables. This preprocessing step scales the data to a fixed range, typically between 0 and 1, which helps in stabilizing the training process and improving the convergence of the model. Normalization ensures that no single feature dominates the learning process due to its scale, leading to a more balanced and generalizable model.\n\nIn summary, our approach to preventing overfitting involved the use of ten-fold cross-validation, mean impact value for feature selection, and min-max normalization. These techniques collectively contributed to the development of a robust and reliable CVD risk prediction model for patients with T2DM.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization schedule used in our study are not explicitly detailed in the provided information. However, we did construct a Deep Neural Network (DNN) with a specific network framework of 18-8-1-1. This framework indicates the number of neurons in each layer of the network. The input layer consists of 18 neurons, followed by a hidden layer with 8 neurons, another hidden layer with 1 neuron, and finally, an output layer with 1 neuron.\n\nThe model was evaluated using a receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, and the area under the curve (AUC) was reported as 0.91. Additionally, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the model were provided as 87.50%, 88.06%, and 87.23%, respectively. These metrics give an idea of the model's performance and the optimization process.\n\nRegarding the availability of model files and optimization parameters, this information is not specified. Typically, such details would be included in supplementary materials or repositories associated with the publication. However, without explicit mention, it is not possible to confirm the availability or the licensing terms under which these resources might be shared.\n\nFor those interested in replicating or building upon our work, it would be advisable to contact the authors directly for access to the specific hyper-parameter configurations, optimization schedules, and any associated model files. This approach ensures that the necessary details are obtained while respecting any potential intellectual property considerations.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in this study is a Deep Neural Network (DNN), which is typically considered a black-box model. This means that while the model can make accurate predictions, the internal workings and the reasoning behind these predictions are not easily interpretable. The DNN consists of multiple layers of neurons that process input data through a series of transformations, making it challenging to trace the exact path that leads to a specific output.\n\nHowever, to enhance the interpretability of the model, we employed the mean impact value (MIV) method. This technique helps to evaluate the effect of each variable on the model's predictions. By creating two new training datasets where each independent variable was increased and decreased by 10%, we were able to simulate the impact of these variables on the model's outcomes. The MIV refers to the mean of the differences observed in these simulations, providing insights into which variables have the greatest influence on the model's predictions.\n\nFor instance, among patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), the top five predictors in the Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk model were Body Mass Index (BMI), anxiety, depression, total cholesterol (TC), and systolic blood pressure (SBP). These variables were identified as having the most significant impact on the model's ability to predict CVD risk. This information not only helps in understanding the key factors contributing to CVD risk but also aids in developing targeted interventions and treatments.\n\nIn summary, while the DNN model itself is a black-box, the use of MIV provides a way to interpret the model's decisions by highlighting the most influential variables. This approach bridges the gap between the model's predictive power and its interpretability, making it a valuable tool for both researchers and healthcare providers.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a classification model. It is designed to predict the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The model uses a Deep Neural Network (DNN) framework with an 18-8-1-1 network structure. The input to the DNN model consists of various independent variables that have been normalized using min-max normalization. The output of the model is a binary classification, where participants are labeled as having the disease (label = 1) or not having the disease (label = 0) based on clinical diagnosis.\n\nThe performance of the model was evaluated using several metrics, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The AUC achieved by the model was 0.91, indicating strong discriminative ability. The accuracy of the model was 87.50%, meaning that 87.50% of the predictions made by the model were correct. Sensitivity, which reflects the model's ability to correctly identify positive incidents (i.e., patients with CVD), was 88.06%. Specificity, which represents the percentage of correctly predicted negative outcomes (i.e., patients without CVD), was 87.23%.\n\nAdditionally, the mean impact value (MIV) was used to evaluate the effect of each variable on the model's results. The top five predictors in the CVD risk model were body mass index (BMI), anxiety, depression, total cholesterol (TC), and systolic blood pressure (SBP). These variables had the greatest impact on the model's predictions.",

  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the method involved several key steps to ensure the robustness and accuracy of the CVD risk prediction model. Initially, the dataset was randomly split into a 75% training set and a 25% test set. This split allowed for the model to be trained on a substantial portion of the data while reserving a separate set for unbiased evaluation.\n\nTo assess the predictive performance and general error estimates, ten-fold cross-validation was employed. This technique involves dividing the training data into ten subsets, training the model on nine of these subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated ten times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. The results from these iterations are then averaged to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance.\n\nThe performance of the CVD risk prediction model was evaluated using several metrics derived from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated, with an AUC of 1 indicating perfect discrimination ability and an AUC of 0.5 indicating worthless performance. Additionally, the model's accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were assessed. Accuracy represents the percentage of correctly predicted outcomes, sensitivity reflects the model's ability to correctly identify positive incidents, and specificity indicates the percentage of correctly predicted negative outcomes for CVD.\n\nFurthermore, the mean impact value (MIV) was used to evaluate the effect of each variable on the results within the neural network application. After building the deep neural network (DNN) model, two new training datasets were created by increasing and decreasing each independent variable by 10%. These datasets were used for simulation according to the fitted model, and MIV was calculated as the mean of the difference between these two simulations. This approach helped in selecting the independent variables that had a significant impact on the CVD risk prediction model.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk prediction model, we employed several key performance metrics to assess the model's effectiveness. The primary metrics reported include the Area Under the Curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.\n\nThe AUC is a crucial metric that evaluates the model's ability to discriminate between positive and negative cases. An AUC of 1 indicates perfect discrimination, while an AUC of 0.5 suggests worthless performance. Our model achieved an AUC of 0.91, demonstrating strong discriminative power.\n\nAccuracy measures the percentage of correctly predicted outcomes. It provides an overall assessment of the model's performance by considering both true positives and true negatives. Our model achieved an accuracy of 87.50%, indicating a high proportion of correct predictions.\n\nSensitivity, also known as the true positive rate, reflects the model's ability to correctly identify positive incidents, i.e., patients with CVD. A higher sensitivity means fewer false negatives, which is critical in medical diagnostics to ensure that patients who have the disease are correctly identified. Our model's sensitivity was 88.06%.\n\nSpecificity, or the true negative rate, represents the percentage of correctly predicted negative outcomes, i.e., patients without CVD. High specificity ensures that the model minimizes false positives, which is important to avoid unnecessary interventions. Our model achieved a specificity of 87.23%.\n\nThese metrics collectively provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance. The reported metrics are representative of standard practices in the literature for evaluating machine learning models in medical diagnostics. They offer a balanced view of the model's ability to correctly identify both positive and negative cases, ensuring reliability and effectiveness in clinical applications.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "Not applicable. The publication focuses on the development and evaluation of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model for predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The evaluation of the model's performance is primarily based on metrics such as the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The study does not mention any comparisons to publicly available methods or simpler baselines on benchmark datasets. Instead, it details the construction and assessment of the DNN model using a specific dataset of 834 patients with T2DM. The model's performance is evaluated through ROC analysis and confusion matrix results, highlighting the effectiveness of the DNN in predicting CVD risk.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk prediction model in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was conducted using several performance metrics. These metrics included the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The AUC of our model was 0.91, indicating strong discriminative ability. The accuracy of the model was 87.50%, with a sensitivity of 88.06% and a specificity of 87.23%. These metrics were derived from a confusion matrix that detailed the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative rates.\n\nTo ensure the robustness of our results, we employed ten-fold cross-validation. This technique helps in assessing the predictive performance and general error estimates, providing a more reliable evaluation of the model's performance. The statistical significance of the differences between patients with CVD and those without was determined using tests such as the Mann-Whitney U-test, t-test, and Chi-Square tests, with a significance level set at p < 0.05.\n\nThe mean impact value (MIV) was used to evaluate the effect of each variable on the model's results. This involved creating two new training datasets where each independent variable was increased and decreased by 10%, respectively. The MIV was then calculated as the mean of the differences between these two datasets, helping to identify the most influential variables in the prediction model.\n\nWhile the performance metrics provide a clear indication of the model's effectiveness, confidence intervals for these metrics were not explicitly stated. However, the use of ten-fold cross-validation and statistically significant tests enhances the confidence in the model's performance. The top predictors identified by the MIV, such as BMI, anxiety, depression, total cholesterol (TC), and systolic blood pressure (SBP), further support the model's reliability in predicting CVD risk in T2DM patients.",
