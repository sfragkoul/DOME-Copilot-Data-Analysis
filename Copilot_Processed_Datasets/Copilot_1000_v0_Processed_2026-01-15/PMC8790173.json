  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study is derived from EEG recordings. The EEG data was collected using a 64-channel cap connected to an eegoTM amplifier, with a sampling rate of 512 Hz and 24-bit resolution. The electrodes were placed according to an extension of the international 10\u201320 system, which does not cover cerebellar locations. The recordings were made during both task-based and resting-state conditions. For task-based data, signals were segmented into 3-second epochs around stimulus onset, while for resting-state data, 4-second non-overlapping epochs were used. The preprocessing steps included band-pass filtering between 1 and 49 Hz, re-referencing to the average of the signals from the left and right mastoids, and the removal of artifacts using Independent Component Analysis (ICA).\n\nThe study involved multiple stimulation protocols, including left motor cortex tACS (lMC-tACS), right cerebellar tACS (rCB-tACS), and sham stimulation. Each session included pre-stimulation and post-stimulation segments, with resting-state recordings and a serial reaction time task (SRTT). The specific order of the blocks and the details of the stimulation protocols are provided in the supplementary materials.\n\nThe dataset consists of EEG epochs from multiple subjects, with approximately 80 epochs for task-based data and around 170 epochs for resting-state data in both pre-stimulation and post-stimulation conditions. The data was analyzed using a multi-class linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier to evaluate classification accuracies across different frequency bands and stimulation protocols.\n\nThe EEG data has not been used in previous publications by the community, as this is the first study to report these findings. The dataset is unique to this study and provides insights into the aftereffects of tACS on EEG signals, particularly in the theta and alpha frequency bands. The analysis pipeline and results contribute to the understanding of how tACS modulates brain activity and its potential applications in neurostimulation research.",
  "dataset/splits": "Not enough information is available.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets were split using a 10-fold cross-validation approach. This method involves dividing the data into 10 parts, where in each iteration, one part is used for testing and the remaining nine parts are used for training. This process is repeated 10 times, ensuring that each part of the data is used for testing exactly once. This approach helps to ensure that the training and testing sets are independent in each fold, reducing the risk of overfitting and providing a more robust evaluation of the model's performance.\n\nTo enforce the independence of the training and test sets, the data was shuffled along the time axis for both pre- and post-stimulation epochs. This shuffling ensures that the temporal order of the epochs does not influence the classification results, making the training and testing phases more reliable. Additionally, the classifier was evaluated using the F1-score, which is the harmonic average of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of the model's performance across different classes.\n\nThe distribution of the datasets used in this study is comparable to previously published machine learning datasets in the field of EEG analysis. The datasets include task-based signals and resting-state signals, both of which are commonly used in EEG studies. The task-based data consists of approximately 80 epochs per class, while the resting-state data consists of approximately 170 epochs per class. This ensures a sufficient number of samples for training and testing the classifier, allowing for robust and reliable results. The use of a multi-class linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier, along with regularization to counteract overfitting, further ensures that the model's performance is generalizable to new, unseen data.",
  "dataset/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used is a regularized multi-class linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier. This algorithm was chosen for its relatively straightforward approach to multiclass classification compared to other algorithms like support vector machines (SVM). The LDA classifier was implemented using the Fieldtrip integrated MVPA-light toolbox. While different classifiers, such as SVM, might produce better classification results, LDA was selected for its simplicity and effectiveness in handling multiclass problems. The performance of LDA was compared with SVM in the supplementary materials for two-class classification scenarios, specifically for MC tACS and sham. The choice of LDA was driven by the need for a clear and interpretable method for distinguishing between multiple classes in the context of EEG signal analysis. The algorithm is not new, but its application in this specific context of EEG signal classification is noteworthy. The focus of the publication is on the application of these techniques to understand the effects of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) on EEG signals, rather than the development of new machine-learning algorithms. Therefore, the algorithm's implementation and results are presented in the context of neurophysiological research.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employed in our study is not a meta-predictor. It does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it relies on EEG spectral power data directly. The classification process involves a multi-class linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier, which is part of the Fieldtrip integrated MVPA-light toolbox. This classifier is used to analyze the differences in EEG spectral power before and after transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS).\n\nThe LDA classifier is trained and tested using a 10-fold cross-validation approach. During training, the model parameters are optimized to discriminate between three classes: left motor cortex tACS (lMC-tACS), right cerebellum tACS (rCB-tACS), and sham. The testing phase evaluates the model's performance on an independent subset of the data that was not used for training. This ensures that the training data is independent from the testing data, maintaining the integrity of the validation process.\n\nThe performance of the classifier is evaluated using the F1-score, which is the harmonic average of precision and recall. This metric provides a comprehensive measure of the classifier's accuracy, especially in the context of multi-class classification. The F1-score is calculated for each frequency component in the 4\u201349 Hz range separately, allowing for a detailed analysis of the classifier's performance across different frequency bands.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps. Initially, short EEG epochs from each stimulation protocol were analyzed at both the scalp level using electrodes and the source level using reconstructed voxels. A simple threshold of -70 \u03bcV to +70 \u03bcV was applied to the filtered data, and the signals were re-referenced to a common-average reference.\n\nThe power spectrum of EEG signals was computed in a 400-ms time window from stimulus onset using a Morlet wavelet. Signals were filtered to obtain oscillatory power at 1\u201349 Hz using wavelets of 7-cycle length. The frequency resolution was set to 1 Hz and the time resolution to 10 ms. Within each epoch, 5-time windows of 10 ms were averaged, producing 8 time-segments.\n\nTo calculate the POST\u2013PRE power difference, the order of the epochs along the time axis in PRE and POST was randomly shuffled. The POST\u2013PRE power for each shuffled trial pair, each time-segment, and each electrode was normally distributed and used as input for the classifier. This input was three-dimensional: all epochs per class, electrodes, and time-segments, with the latter specified as the feature domain. A vector of class-labels was also provided, indicating the stimulation session for each epoch.\n\nClassification was performed at each frequency component in the 4\u201349-Hz range separately. The classifier searched for the optimal time-segments within the specified time window for the classification process. The performance of the classifier was then evaluated for each electrode.\n\nFor classification, data were projected into a 2-dimensional discriminative subspace, and an optimal linear transformation was applied to maximize class separability. A regularization parameter was estimated to counteract overfitting. The procedure involved training, testing, and cross-validation. During training, the model parameters were optimized to discriminate between the three classes. During testing, the model performance was evaluated on an independent subset of the data. The training and testing phases were repeated using 10-fold cross-validation, where the data was split into 10 parts, and in each iteration, one part was used for testing and the other nine for training. The performance of the classifier was evaluated using the F1-score, which is the harmonic average of precision and recall.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the primary input parameters for the model were the spectral power differences between pre- and post-stimulation epochs, calculated across various frequency bands and time segments. Specifically, the input for the classifier was three-dimensional, consisting of all epochs per class, electrodes, and time-segments. The feature domain was specified as the time-segments, with a focus on the 4\u201349 Hz frequency range.\n\nThe selection of these parameters was guided by the need to capture the dynamic changes in EEG signals induced by transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). The power spectrum of EEG signals was computed in a 400-ms time window from stimulus onset using a Morlet wavelet, with signals filtered to obtain oscillatory power at 1\u201349 Hz. Frequency resolution was set to 1 Hz, and time resolution to 10 ms. Within each epoch, 5-time windows of 10 ms were averaged, producing 8 time-segments.\n\nTo ensure robust classification, a regularization parameter \u03bb was estimated to counteract overfitting. The procedure involved training, testing, and cross-validation, with the data split into 10 parts for 10-fold cross-validation. This approach allowed for the optimization of model parameters to discriminate between the three classes: left motor cortex tACS (lMC-tACS), right cerebellar tACS (rCB-tACS), and sham stimulation.\n\nThe number of parameters (p) used in the model was determined by the dimensionality of the input data and the complexity of the classifier. The multi-class linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier was chosen for its relatively straightforward approach to multiclass classification, although other classifiers like support vector machines (SVM) could potentially yield better results. The performance of the classifier was evaluated using the F1-score, which provided a balanced measure of precision and recall across the different classes and frequency bands.",
  "optimization/features": "The input features for the classification process were derived from the EEG signals, specifically the spectral power differences before and after transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). The features used as input for the classifier were three-dimensional, consisting of all epochs per class, electrodes, and time-segments. The time-segments were specified as the feature domain, with 8 time-segments created by averaging 5-time windows of 10 ms within each epoch.\n\nThe spectral power was calculated in a 400-ms time window from stimulus onset using a Morlet wavelet, filtered to obtain oscillatory power at 1\u201349 Hz. The frequency resolution was set to 1 Hz, and the time resolution to 10 ms. This resulted in a detailed representation of the EEG signals across different frequencies and time points.\n\nFeature selection was not explicitly mentioned as a separate step in the process. However, the classification was performed at each frequency component in the 4\u201349-Hz range separately, which implies that the features were evaluated individually for their classification performance. This approach allows the classifier to identify the optimal time-segments within the specified time window for the classification process, effectively selecting the most informative features for each frequency component.\n\nThe procedure ensured that the features used for classification were derived from the data in a way that maximized class separability. The regularization parameter was estimated to counteract overfitting, and the performance of the classifier was evaluated using the F1-score, which is the harmonic average of precision and recall. This metric provides a comprehensive evaluation of the classifier's performance, taking into account both the precision and recall of the classifications.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed a regularized multi-class linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier, which is known for its relatively straightforward approach to multiclass classification. The number of parameters in our model was indeed larger than the number of training points, as we were dealing with high-dimensional EEG data. To address the risk of over-fitting, we implemented a regularization parameter, \u03bb, which was estimated during the training process. This regularization helped to constrain the model complexity and prevent it from fitting the noise in the data.\n\nTo further ensure that our model was not over-fitting, we used a 10-fold cross-validation approach. This involved splitting the data into 10 different parts, using one part for testing and the remaining nine for training in each iteration. This process was repeated 10 times, with each part used once as the test set. The performance of the classifier was then evaluated using the F1-score, which is the harmonic average of precision and recall. This metric provided a balanced measure of the classifier's performance, especially in the presence of class imbalances.\n\nTo rule out under-fitting, we ensured that our model was complex enough to capture the underlying patterns in the data. The use of a multi-class LDA classifier, along with the regularization parameter, allowed us to find an optimal balance between bias and variance. Additionally, the high classification accuracies observed in our results suggest that our model was able to learn the relevant features from the data without being too simplistic.\n\nIn summary, we addressed the challenges of over-fitting and under-fitting by using regularization, cross-validation, and a suitable classifier. These measures ensured that our model was robust and generalizable to new data.",
  "optimization/regularization": "To counteract over-fitting, a regularization parameter \u03bb was estimated. This procedure involved training, testing, and cross-validation. During training, the parameters of the model were optimized to discriminate between the three classes. During testing, the model performance was evaluated on an independent subset of the data, which was not used for training. The training and testing phases were repeated on different subsets of the data using 10-fold cross-validation. In this process, the data was split into 10 different parts, and in each iteration of the cross-validation phase, one of the 10 parts was used for testing while the other 9 parts were used for training. This approach helped to ensure that the model generalized well to unseen data and prevented over-fitting.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a black box but rather a transparent approach that allows for interpretability. The analysis pipeline involves several clear and interpretable steps, starting with the preprocessing of EEG signals. These signals are filtered, re-referenced, and segmented into epochs, which are then analyzed using a multi-class linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier. The LDA classifier is chosen for its straightforward approach to multiclass classification, making it easier to understand and interpret compared to more complex algorithms like support vector machines (SVM).\n\nThe classifier's performance is evaluated using the F1-score, which is the harmonic average of precision and recall. This metric provides a clear measure of the classifier's accuracy, taking into account both false positives and false negatives. The F1-score is calculated for different frequency bands (theta, alpha, beta, and gamma), allowing for a detailed analysis of how well the classifier can distinguish between different stimulation protocols across these bands.\n\nAdditionally, the model includes a source reconstruction step using the linear constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamforming approach. This step involves creating a head model and estimating the electric field measured by the EEG electrodes, which is then used to calculate the inverse spatial filter. The reconstructed signals in the alpha and theta frequency bands are then classified, and the performance of the classifier is evaluated for each grid point. This approach provides a spatial dimension to the analysis, allowing for the identification of specific brain regions involved in the classification process.\n\nThe use of nonparametric statistical tests, such as cluster-based permutation testing and the Kruskal-Wallis test, further enhances the interpretability of the results. These tests provide a robust way to compare classification accuracies across different stimulation protocols and brain regions, without making strong assumptions about the data distribution.\n\nOverall, the model's transparency is ensured by the clear and interpretable steps involved in the analysis pipeline, the use of straightforward classification algorithms, and the application of robust statistical methods. This allows for a detailed understanding of how the model works and how it can be used to interpret the results of the study.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in this study is a classification model. Specifically, a multi-class linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier was used to analyze EEG data. The classifier was trained to differentiate between three classes: left motor cortex transcranial alternating current stimulation (lMC-tACS), right cerebellum tACS (rCB-tACS), and sham stimulation. The performance of the classifier was evaluated using the F1-score, which is the harmonic average of precision and recall. This score was calculated for each frequency band (theta, alpha, beta, and gamma) and for each electrode or region of interest in the source-space analysis. The model's output provides insights into how well the classifier can distinguish between the different stimulation protocols based on the EEG data.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time of the model varied depending on the specific analyses being performed. EEG recordings were collected at a sampling rate of 512 Hz with 24-bit resolution, and preprocessing involved several steps, including band-pass filtering, re-referencing, and artifact removal. These steps were conducted using in-house MATLAB scripts and the EEGLAB toolbox, which are computationally intensive and can take a significant amount of time, especially for large datasets.\n\nThe spectral power analysis involved computing the power spectrum of EEG signals in 400-ms time windows from stimulus onset using Morlet wavelets. This process was repeated for multiple frequency bands and time segments, contributing to the overall execution time.\n\nThe multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) using a regularized multi-class linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier was another time-consuming step. The classifier was trained and tested using 10-fold cross-validation, which involves splitting the data into multiple subsets and repeating the training and testing phases. This iterative process is essential for evaluating the model's performance but adds to the execution time.\n\nAdditionally, source reconstruction using the linear constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamforming approach required creating a head model, estimating the electric field, and calculating the inverse spatial filter. These steps are computationally demanding and can take a considerable amount of time, especially when performed across all trials and frequency bands.\n\nOverall, the execution time of the model was influenced by the complexity of the preprocessing steps, the spectral power analysis, the MVPA, and the source reconstruction. While specific execution times were not provided, it is clear that the model involved extensive computational processing to achieve the desired analyses.",
  "model/availability": "The source code for the algorithms used in this study is not publicly released. However, the analysis was performed using established toolboxes and software, such as Fieldtrip and EEGLAB, which are widely available and well-documented. The specific in-house MATLAB scripts developed for preprocessing and analysis are not provided, but the methods and steps taken are thoroughly described in the publication. This allows for reproducibility by other researchers who can implement similar scripts based on the detailed procedures outlined. Additionally, the use of standard toolboxes ensures that the methods can be easily replicated using the same or similar software environments.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method employed in this study involved a comprehensive approach to assess the classification accuracy of EEG signals following different stimulation protocols. The primary metric used for evaluation was the F1-score, which is the harmonic average of precision and recall. This score was chosen for its suitability in multiclass classification scenarios.\n\nThe evaluation process began with the computation of the power spectrum of EEG signals in 400-ms time windows from stimulus onset, using a Morlet wavelet. These signals were filtered to obtain oscillatory power at frequencies ranging from 1 to 49 Hz. The spectral power difference before (PRE) and after (POST) transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) was calculated by randomly shuffling the order of epochs along the time axis. This shuffling ensured that the analysis was not biased by any temporal order effects.\n\nThe shuffled POST-PRE power differences were then used as input for a regularized multiclass linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier. The classifier was trained and tested using 10-fold cross-validation, where the data was split into 10 parts, and in each iteration, one part was used for testing while the remaining nine parts were used for training. This procedure was repeated for different subsets of the data to ensure robustness and generalizability of the results.\n\nThe performance of the classifier was evaluated at each frequency component within the 4-49 Hz range separately. This allowed for the identification of optimal time-segments within the specified time window for the classification process. The classifier's performance was then assessed for each electrode, providing a detailed map of classification accuracies across the scalp.\n\nFor source-space data, the evaluation involved testing for F1-score differences across classes using the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test in specified regions of interest (ROIs). The p-level threshold was corrected for false discovery rate (FDR) across the ROIs to control for multiple comparisons. Post-hoc tests of significant effects were performed using the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test.\n\nAdditionally, phase-coupling analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between aftereffects in theta (\u03b8) and alpha (\u03b1) frequency bands. Phase-locking values (PLV) were measured and compared across stimulation protocols using the Kruskal-Wallis test. The p-level threshold was FDR-corrected across the electrodes to ensure the reliability of the findings.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation method involved a rigorous and multifaceted approach, including cross-validation, nonparametric statistical tests, and FDR correction, to ensure the robustness and validity of the classification results. This comprehensive evaluation allowed for a detailed understanding of the effects of different stimulation protocols on EEG signals.",
  "evaluation/measure": "To evaluate the performance of our classification models, we primarily report the F1-score. The F1-score is the harmonic average of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both concerns. Precision is defined as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives, while recall is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives. This metric is particularly useful for multiclass classification problems, as it provides a more comprehensive evaluation than accuracy alone, especially when dealing with imbalanced classes.\n\nThe F1-score was calculated for each frequency component within the 4\u201349 Hz range, separately for theta (4\u20138 Hz), alpha (9\u201313 Hz), beta (14\u201330 Hz), and gamma (31\u201349 Hz) bands. This approach allows us to assess the classification performance across different frequency bands, providing a detailed understanding of how well our model can distinguish between different stimulation protocols.\n\nIn addition to the F1-score, we also report the results of statistical analyses, including nonparametric cluster-based Monte Carlo permutation testing and the Kruskal-Wallis test. These tests help us identify significant differences in classification accuracies across different stimulation protocols and frequency bands. Post-hoc tests using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test further elucidate these differences, ensuring that our findings are robust and statistically significant.\n\nThe use of the F1-score aligns with common practices in the literature, particularly in studies involving EEG data and multiclass classification. This metric is widely recognized for its ability to provide a balanced evaluation of model performance, making it a representative choice for our analysis. The additional statistical tests further enhance the rigor of our evaluation, ensuring that our results are both reliable and meaningful.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "A comparison of performance between different algorithms was conducted, specifically between the regularized multi-class linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier and support vector machine (SVM). The LDA was chosen for its relatively straightforward approach to multiclass classification compared to SVM. However, it was acknowledged that SVM might produce better classification results, allowing for stronger differentiation between the three classes. To provide a comprehensive evaluation, a comparison of performance by both algorithms was included in the Supplementary Materials, focusing on two classes: MC tACS and sham. This comparison aimed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the chosen method while also considering alternative approaches. The results of this comparison are not detailed in the main text but are available for further inspection in the supplementary materials.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the classification results was conducted using the F1-score, which is the harmonic average of precision and recall. This metric was chosen for its optimality in multiclass classification scenarios. The F1-score was averaged across different frequency bands, including theta (\u03b8, 4\u20138 Hz), alpha (\u03b1, 9\u201313 Hz), beta (\u03b2, 14\u201330 Hz), and gamma (\u03b3, 31\u201349 Hz).\n\nTo ensure the robustness of the findings, statistical significance was assessed using various methods. For scalp-level data, a nonparametric cluster-based Monte Carlo permutation testing with 1000 randomizations was employed. This approach resulted in F-values for comparisons across all classes in each electrode and each frequency band. For source-space data, the nonparametric Kruskal\u2013Wallis test was used to test for F1-score differences across classes in specified regions of interest (ROIs). The p-level threshold was corrected for false discovery rate (FDR) across the ROIs. Post-hoc tests for significant effects were performed using the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test.\n\nThe results indicated statistically significant differences in classification accuracies for alpha and theta power, particularly in electrodes FC3 and CP3, which are adjacent to the stimulation sites. These differences were observed in both task-based and resting-state eyes-open (RSEO) conditions. The post-hoc tests revealed that the significant differences stemmed from larger classification accuracies for left motor cortex transcranial alternating current stimulation (lMC-tACS) compared to right cerebellar transcranial alternating current stimulation (rCB-tACS) and sham stimulation.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation confidence is high due to the use of robust statistical methods and the correction for multiple comparisons. The results demonstrate that the classification method is superior in distinguishing between different stimulation protocols, particularly for alpha and theta power in specific electrodes and ROIs.",
