  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset utilized in this study was sourced from patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who were treated at the People\u2019s Hospital and Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Huangpi District, Wuhan City. A total of 758 patients were included in the study. The data was retrospectively collected from previous studies conducted in Chinese. This dataset has been used in prior research, specifically in studies that investigated the effects of inulin intervention on T2DM patients. The data includes various health metrics such as gender, age, body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose (FBG), two-hour postprandial glucose (2 h-PG), HbA1c levels, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). The dataset was divided into training and testing sets in a 7:3 ratio for the construction of predictive models using the XGBoost machine learning algorithm.",
  "dataset/splits": "Not enough information is available.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset used in this study was split into training and testing sets in a 7:3 ratio. This means that 70% of the data was used for training the model, while the remaining 30% was reserved for testing its performance. The training and testing sets were designed to be independent to ensure that the model's performance could be evaluated on unseen data, simulating real-world conditions.\n\nTo enforce the independence of the training and testing sets, standard practices were followed. The data was randomly shuffled before splitting to ensure that the distribution of features and labels was similar in both sets. This randomization helps to prevent any bias that might arise from the order of the data.\n\nThe distribution of the dataset compares favorably to previously published machine learning datasets in the context of medical research. The dataset includes a diverse range of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), encompassing various ages, body mass indexes (BMIs), genders, and durations since diabetes diagnosis. This diversity is crucial for developing a robust model that can generalize well to different patient populations.\n\nThe key features considered in the dataset include age, BMI, fasting blood glucose (FBG), the difference between 2-hour postprandial glucose and FBG (DeltaPG), area under the curve (AUC) of blood glucose changes, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). These features were selected based on their relevance to T2DM and their potential to influence the effectiveness of inulin intervention.\n\nThe dataset's redundancy was managed through careful feature selection and preprocessing. LASSO regression was employed to identify the most predictive characteristic variables, reducing the influence of multicollinearity. This process ensured that the model was built on a set of independent and relevant features, enhancing its predictive accuracy and reliability.",
  "dataset/availability": "The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article and supplementary material. Further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding authors. The data is not released in a public forum.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in our study is the XGBoost algorithm, which is a type of gradient boosting framework. This algorithm is not new; it has been widely used and recognized in the machine learning community for its efficiency and effectiveness in handling structured/tabular data.\n\nThe reason it was not published in a machine-learning journal is that our primary focus was on applying this established algorithm to a specific medical problem\u2014predicting the effectiveness of inulin intervention in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. Our contribution lies in the application and validation of the XGBoost algorithm in this particular context, rather than in the development of a new machine-learning algorithm. The study aims to bridge the gap between machine learning and nutritional intervention in T2DM treatment, providing valuable insights for researchers in this field.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model described in this publication does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. It is not a meta-predictor. The XGBoost model is built using a dataset that includes variables such as age, BMI, fasting blood glucose (FBG), the difference between fasting and 2-hour postprandial glucose levels (DeltaPG), HbA1c, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). These variables were selected using LASSO regression to ensure that the model is robust and not affected by multicollinearity.\n\nThe dataset used for training and testing the XGBoost model was divided into training and testing sets in a 7:3 ratio. This division ensures that the training data is independent of the testing data, which is crucial for evaluating the model's performance accurately. The model's performance was assessed using metrics such as accuracy, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value, both for the training and testing sets. Additionally, receiver operating curves (ROCs), calibration curves, and decision curves were generated to further evaluate the model's effectiveness.\n\nThe XGBoost model was optimized using specific parameters, including a learning rate (eta) of 0.01, max_depth of 3, lambda of 1, subsample of 0.8, and colsample_bytree of 0.8, with the number of iteration rounds set to 100. These parameters were chosen to enhance the model's predictive power and ensure that it generalizes well to new data. The model's performance metrics indicate that it has a high level of accuracy and specificity, making it a reliable tool for predicting the effectiveness of inulin intervention in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing steps were crucial for constructing the XGBoost prediction model. Initially, the dataset was divided into training and testing sets in a 7:3 ratio to ensure a robust evaluation of the model's performance. The feature variables were then transformed into DMatrix format, which is a specialized data structure used by the XGBoost package to efficiently handle large datasets and accelerate the training process.\n\nBefore building the model, several preprocessing steps were undertaken. The basic information about the patients, including gender, age, BMI, fasting blood glucose (FBG), two-hour postprandial glucose (2 h-PG), difference value between 2 h-PG and FBG (DeltaPG), area under the curve (AUC) of blood glucose changes, HbA1c, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), was collected. These variables were analyzed individually using the \u201cCBCgrps\u201d package in R. The correlation between these variables was assessed using the \u201ccorrplot\u201d package, which helped in understanding the relationships and potential multicollinearity among the features.\n\nTo address multicollinearity and select the most relevant features, LASSO regression was employed using the \u201cglmnet\u201d package in R. This method adjusted the coefficients of the independent variables to zero, effectively reducing the influence of multicollinearity on the regression results. The LASSO regression analysis identified the four most predictive characteristic variables: age, BMI, FBG, DeltaPG, HbA1c, and HDL. These variables were then used to construct the XGBoost model.\n\nThe learning rate (eta) was set to 0.01, max_depth to 3, lambda to 1, subsample to 0.8, and colsample_bytree to 0.8. The number of iteration rounds was set to 100 to ensure the model's convergence and optimal performance. The \u201ccaret\u201d package in R was utilized to compute the model\u2019s performance metrics, including accuracy, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Additionally, receiver operating curves (ROCs), calibration curves, and decision curves were generated to assess and evaluate the model's performance.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized six key parameters to construct the XGBoost model. These parameters were carefully selected and optimized to ensure the model's effectiveness. The parameters included the learning rate (eta), set to 0.01, max_depth to 3, lambda to 1, subsample to 0.8, and colsample_bytree to 0.8. Additionally, the number of iteration rounds was set to 100.\n\nThe selection of these parameters was guided by a systematic approach to optimize the model's performance. We employed the \"symbol package\" to insert and test various parameter configurations, ultimately choosing the best set that yielded the most accurate and reliable results. This process ensured that our model was robust and capable of making precise predictions.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we initially considered a comprehensive set of features for our predictive model. These features included demographic and clinical variables such as age, body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose (FBG), two-hour postprandial glucose (2 h-PG), the difference between 2 h-PG and FBG (DeltaPG), area under the curve (AUC) of blood glucose changes, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL).\n\nTo ensure the robustness and generalizability of our model, we performed feature selection using the training set only. This process involved using LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression, which is effective in handling multicollinearity and selecting the most predictive features. Through this method, we identified the most significant features that contributed to the model's predictive power. The final set of features used in our XGBoost model included age, BMI, FBG, DeltaPG, HbA1c, and HDL. This selection process helped in reducing the complexity of the model and improving its performance by focusing on the most relevant variables.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The XGBoost model was constructed with careful consideration to avoid both overfitting and underfitting. The model parameters were optimized using cross-validation to ensure a good fit. Specifically, the lambda corresponding to the minimum mean square error was selected after cross-validation, which helps in preventing overfitting by adding a regularization term.\n\nTo further mitigate overfitting, several regularization parameters were tuned. The learning rate (eta) was set to 0.01, which controls the contribution of each tree. A lower learning rate requires more trees to be built, but it makes the model more robust. The maximum depth of the trees (max_depth) was set to 3, which limits the complexity of the individual trees and helps in preventing the model from becoming too complex and overfitting the training data. Additionally, subsampling parameters such as subsample and colsample_bytree were set to 0.8, which means that only 80% of the data and 80% of the features were used to grow each tree. This technique also helps in reducing overfitting.\n\nUnderfitting was addressed by ensuring that the model had enough capacity to capture the underlying patterns in the data. The number of iteration rounds was set to 100, which allows the model to learn sufficiently from the training data. The selected features, including age, BMI, FBG, DeltaPG, HbA1c, and HDL, were chosen based on their predictive power, ensuring that the model had relevant information to make accurate predictions.\n\nThe performance of the model was evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value, both in the training and testing sets. The high values of these metrics in the training set indicate that the model was able to learn the patterns in the data effectively, while the slightly lower but still high values in the testing set suggest that the model generalizes well to unseen data. The area under the ROC curve for both the training and testing sets further confirms the model's strong performance and its ability to avoid both overfitting and underfitting.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our model. Specifically, we utilized Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression for feature selection. This method helps in selecting the most predictive variables by shrinking the coefficients of less important features to zero, thereby reducing the complexity of the model and mitigating overfitting. The lambda value corresponding to the minimum mean square error was chosen after cross-validation, ensuring an optimal balance between bias and variance. Additionally, we constructed an XGBoost prediction model with parameters such as learning rate, max depth, and lambda carefully tuned to further enhance model performance and prevent overfitting. These techniques collectively contributed to the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data.",

  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a blackbox. To ensure transparency and interpretability, we utilized SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values. SHAP values allow for a detailed inspection of the predictive value of individual samples and the influence of their characteristics on the model's predictions. This method provides a clear and intuitive way to understand how each feature contributes to the model's output.\n\nFor instance, we randomly selected two patients and used SHAP force diagrams to explain the contribution of their characteristic factors. In these diagrams, each feature's value is displayed from left to right, with red bars indicating positive contributions and blue bars indicating negative contributions. The mean output of the model, denoted as E[f(x)], serves as a baseline, and the SHAP value of a single sample, f(x), shows the deviation from this baseline.\n\nIn one example, the SHAP value for a patient was -0.150, which was below the effective mean value of 0.333. This indicated that the inulin intervention treatment was not effective for this particular patient. Conversely, another patient had a SHAP value of 0.668, which was higher than the predicted mean value of 0.331, suggesting that the inulin intervention treatment was effective for this patient.\n\nBy ranking the features based on the average absolute value of their SHAP values, we identified the most influential factors. This approach not only makes the model's decisions transparent but also provides actionable insights into which factors are most important for predicting the effectiveness of inulin intervention in T2DM treatment.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a classification model. It is designed to predict the effectiveness of inulin intervention in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The model identifies whether a patient will respond positively to the treatment, indicated by a reduction in HbA1c levels to less than 6.5%, or not.\n\nThe XGBoost prediction model was constructed and evaluated using various performance metrics. In the training set, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.819, specificity of 0.913, positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.818, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.820. For the testing set, the accuracy was 0.709, specificity was 0.909, PPV was 0.705, and NPV was 0.710. These metrics indicate how well the model's predictions align with the true values, with higher values signifying better performance.\n\nThe area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.892 for the training set and 0.771 for the testing set, demonstrating strong model fidelity. Additionally, calibration curves for both sets showed a good alignment between predicted and actual values, further supporting the model's reliability.\n\nThe decision curves for the training set outperformed those of the validation set, indicating that the model provides a favorable net benefit for clinical decision-making across most threshold probabilities.\n\nThe model's parameters were optimized using techniques such as cross-validation to select the best lambda value corresponding to the minimum mean square error. The final model included key predictive variables such as age, BMI, fasting blood glucose (FBG), change in postprandial glucose (DeltaPG), HbA1c, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL).\n\nSHAP values were used to interpret the model, allowing for an inspection of the predictive value of individual samples and the influence of their characteristics on the predictions. This analysis helped in understanding the contribution of each feature factor to the model's predictions and in ranking the features based on their importance.",

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the XGBoost prediction model involved several key metrics and techniques to ensure its robustness and accuracy. The model's performance was assessed using both training and testing sets, providing a comprehensive view of its efficacy.\n\nThe evaluation metrics included accuracy, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). For the training set, the model demonstrated an accuracy of 0.819, specificity of 0.913, PPV of 0.8181, and NPV of 0.820. In the testing set, the accuracy was 0.709, specificity was 0.909, PPV was 0.705, and NPV was 0.710.

  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our XGBoost prediction model, several key performance metrics were reported to assess its effectiveness. These metrics include accuracy, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). Accuracy measures the proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined. Specificity indicates the true negative rate, which is the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified by the model. PPV, also known as precision, represents the probability that subjects with a positive screening test truly have the condition. Conversely, NPV signifies the probability that subjects with a negative screening test truly do not have the condition.\n\nThe model demonstrated an accuracy of 0.819, specificity of 0.913, PPV of 0.8181, and NPV of 0.820 in the training set. For the testing set, the accuracy was 0.709, specificity was 0.909, PPV was 0.705, and NPV was 0.710. These metrics indicate that the model performs well in both training and testing phases, although there is a slight decrease in performance when transitioning from the training set to the testing set. This is a common observation and suggests that the model generalizes reasonably well to new, unseen data.\n\nAdditionally, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was reported. The AUC for the training set was 0.892, and for the testing set, it was 0.771. A higher AUC indicates better model performance, and the values obtained suggest that the model has strong discriminative ability.\n\nThe reported metrics are representative of standard practices in the literature for evaluating predictive models, particularly in the context of medical and health-related studies. Accuracy, specificity, PPV, NPV, and AUC are commonly used metrics that provide a comprehensive view of a model's performance. These metrics help in understanding the model's ability to correctly classify cases, its reliability in identifying true positives and negatives, and its overall discriminative power.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "Not applicable. The publication focuses on the development and evaluation of an XGBoost prediction model for assessing the therapeutic effect of inulin intervention in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The evaluation primarily involves internal metrics such as accuracy, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for both training and testing sets. Additionally, the model's performance is assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calibration curves. However, there is no mention of comparing the proposed method to publicly available methods or simpler baselines on benchmark datasets. The evaluation is centered on the model's internal performance and its ability to predict treatment outcomes based on selected features.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The performance metrics of the XGBoost prediction model include confidence intervals, which are provided in parentheses. For instance, the accuracy in the training set is reported as 0.819 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.783 to 0.851. Similarly, the testing set accuracy is 0.709 with a confidence interval of 0.623 to 0.747. This indicates the range within which the true accuracy is likely to fall, providing a measure of the precision of these estimates.\n\nThe statistical significance of the results is evident in the differences observed between the groups with positive and negative treatment effects. Variables such as age, BMI, FBG, 2 h-PG, DeltaPG, AUC, HbA1c, and TG showed significant differences (p < 0.05), suggesting that these factors are important in predicting the effectiveness of inulin intervention. The use of statistical tests like the chi-square test, t-tests, and non-parametric tests further supports the robustness of the findings.\n\nThe model's performance, as indicated by metrics like accuracy, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value, demonstrates its effectiveness in predicting outcomes. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the training set is 0.892, and for the testing set, it is 0.771, both of which are relatively high, indicating strong model fidelity. The calibration curves also show a good alignment between predicted and actual values, further confirming the model's reliability.\n\nOverall, the inclusion of confidence intervals and the statistical significance of the results provide a solid foundation for claiming that the XGBoost prediction model is effective and superior to other methods and baselines.",
