  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. ADNI is a public-private partnership launched in 2003 with the primary goal of testing whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessments can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). The dataset includes longitudinal data, which is crucial for tracking changes over time.\n\nThe ADNI protocol included a sagittal volumetric 3D MPRAGE with specific spatial resolution and slice thickness. The target values for the echo time (TE) and repetition time (TR) were approximately 3.9 ms and 8.9 ms, respectively. While the ADNI protocol included MR scans of varying strengths, this study focused on 1.5T scans to ensure consistency across different subjects and time points.\n\nThe study included a total of 152 subjects, divided into four clinical groups: normal controls (NC), stable mild cognitive impairment (S-MCI), progressive mild cognitive impairment (P-MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The P-MCI group consisted of 39 subjects who were re-scanned and re-evaluated every six months for at least 24 months and developed probable AD after at least 12 months from the baseline scan. The other three clinical groups were matched to the P-MCI group for demographic information, such as gender and age, with specific constraints to ensure comparability.\n\nThe dataset has been used in various studies focused on the comparative analysis between different clinical groups and the prediction of AD conversion. The longitudinal nature of the data allows for the analysis of cortical thickness changes over time, which is essential for understanding the progression of AD and MCI. The ADNI database is widely used by the research community for studies related to Alzheimer's disease and cognitive impairment.",
  "dataset/splits": "In our study, we utilized data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to form specific groups for analysis. The primary group of interest is the progressive mild cognitive impairment (P-MCI) group, which includes subjects who met the following criteria: they were re-scanned and re-evaluated every six months for at least 24 months, and they developed probable Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) after at least 12 months from the baseline scan. As of December 2009, 39 subjects from ADNI met these criteria and were included in the P-MCI group.\n\nFor the other three clinical groups, subjects were selected to match the demographic information of the P-MCI group, ensuring the same gender and age. If an exact match was not possible, the gender constraint was relaxed first, followed by the age constraint, with a maximum age difference of 3 years. Each of these groups also required subjects to have at least 4 time-points to facilitate the calculation of dynamic features.\n\nThe demographic and clinical information of all selected subjects across the four groups is summarized in a table. This table provides a detailed breakdown of the distribution of data points in each group, ensuring that the analysis is robust and comparable across different clinical conditions.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "Not applicable.",
  "dataset/availability": "The dataset used in this study was obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, which is publicly available at www.adniinfo.org. The ADNI database is a large-scale, longitudinal study that includes MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessments. The primary goal of ADNI is to test whether these markers can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD).\n\nThe ADNI database is accessible to researchers upon registration and approval, ensuring that the data is used responsibly and ethically. The data is released under a data use agreement that outlines the terms and conditions for its use, including requirements for data sharing, publication, and acknowledgment of the ADNI study. This agreement helps to enforce the proper use of the data and ensures that the contributions of the ADNI study are recognized.\n\nThe dataset includes a variety of imaging and clinical data, such as sagittal volumetric 3D MPRAGE scans with specific spatial resolution and slice thickness. The ADNI protocol included target values for TE and TR, and the study used 1.5T scans for consistency across subjects and time-points. The dataset also includes demographic and clinical information for the selected subjects, which is summarized in a table.\n\nThe data splits used in the study were designed to match demographic information across different clinical groups, ensuring that the subjects had similar gender and age distributions. This was enforced by selecting subjects with the same gender and age, relaxing the gender constraint if necessary, and ensuring that the age difference did not exceed three years. The subjects in the P-MCI group were required to have at least five time-points, including baseline and follow-up scans, to calculate dynamic features. For other clinical groups, subjects were required to have at least four time-points.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our study is a support vector machine (SVM) nonlinear classifier. This is a well-established machine-learning algorithm class, known for its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces and its ability to handle both linear and nonlinear classification tasks.\n\nThe SVM algorithm used is not new; it has been extensively studied and applied in various fields, including medical imaging and neurobiology. The reason it was not published in a machine-learning journal is that our focus is on its application to specific problems in neurobiology, particularly in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis and prediction of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD conversion. The novelty of our work lies in the application of SVM, along with other features, to improve the accuracy of AD diagnosis and MCI conversion prediction, rather than in the development of a new machine-learning algorithm.\n\nOur approach involves using the mRMR (minimum redundancy maximum relevance) feature selection algorithm to identify the most informative features from different categories, including static, dynamic, and network features. These selected features are then used to train the SVM classifier. The combination of these features and the SVM classifier has shown significant improvements in classification accuracy, particularly in distinguishing between progressive MCI (P-MCI) and stable MCI (S-MCI) subjects. This demonstrates the practical utility of the SVM algorithm in our specific domain of study.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employs a meta-predictor approach, leveraging outputs from multiple machine-learning algorithms as inputs. Specifically, the meta-predictor integrates features from different categories, including static, dynamic, and network features, to enhance classification accuracy.\n\nThe primary machine-learning methods constituting the whole system include the mRMR (minimum redundancy maximum relevance) feature selection algorithm and support vector machines (SVM). The mRMR algorithm is used to select the optimal feature subset, ensuring that the chosen features are both relevant to the classification task and minimally redundant. This selected feature set is then used to train an SVM nonlinear classifier.\n\nRegarding the independence of training data, the approach ensures that the data used for training the meta-predictor is independent. This is achieved by using different subsets of features and different time-points for training and validation, thereby maintaining the integrity and independence of the training data. The use of independent data subsets helps in avoiding overfitting and ensures that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data.",
  "optimization/encoding": "To prepare the data for the machine-learning algorithm, several preprocessing steps were undertaken. Initially, features from three distinct categories\u2014static, dynamic, and network\u2014were considered. The goal was to select a feature subset that was both comprehensive and had minimal redundancy. This was achieved using the mRMR (minimum redundancy maximum relevance) feature selection algorithm. This approach jointly considers all features to identify a minimal set that maximally differentiates the classes.\n\nFor the classification tasks, a support vector machine (SVM) nonlinear classifier was trained. This classifier was used to recognize spatial-temporal thinning and brain network changes that distinguish between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and normal control (NC) individuals. For the discrimination between progressive mild cognitive impairment (P-MCI) and stable mild cognitive impairment (S-MCI), a similar approach was adopted, but only the thickness values measured 6 months ahead of AD conversion were used. This allowed the classification results to provide a short-term prediction of the conversion from MCI to AD.\n\nThe data encoding involved computing correlations between thickness measurements and Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) scores for each subject, which were then averaged within the P-MCI group. This group was chosen because subjects in this group exhibit relatively large changes in thickness and clinical scores. The conventional 3D method and the 4D method were compared, with the 4D method showing much higher correlations with clinical scores. To control for multiple comparison errors, False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction was applied.\n\nAdditionally, longitudinal thickness measurements were used to compute 4D maps of the thickness thinning ratio within each clinical group. These maps were averaged across subjects to create mean thinning ratio maps for different clinical groups. The results indicated that the four groups\u2014NC, S-MCI, P-MCI, and AD\u2014had very different cortical thinning ratios over a 24-month period. The spatial distribution of cortical thinning was similar across all groups, suggesting that dynamic features could provide valuable complementary information for classification, especially between P-MCI and S-MCI.\n\nThe selected optimal feature set for the classification tasks included a combination of static, dynamic, and network features. For example, for distinguishing AD from NC, features such as endline thickness, clustering coefficient, and thinning speed were selected. For distinguishing P-MCI from S-MCI, baseline thickness, thinning speed, and thinning ratio were among the selected features. The order of these features in the selection process did not indicate individual importance but rather the complementary information they provided when combined.\n\nIn summary, the data encoding and preprocessing involved selecting a comprehensive and non-redundant feature set using the mRMR algorithm, training an SVM classifier, and computing correlations and thinning ratios to differentiate between various clinical groups. This approach ensured that the machine-learning algorithm had access to the most relevant and informative features for accurate classification.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the number of parameters used in the model varies depending on the classification task. For the classification between Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Normal Control (NC), seven features were selected as optimal. These features include a mix of static, dynamic, and network characteristics, ensuring a comprehensive representation of the data. For the classification between Progressive Mild Cognitive Impairment (P-MCI) and Stable Mild Cognitive Impairment (S-MCI), six features were deemed optimal. These features also encompass static, dynamic, and network attributes, with a notable inclusion of more dynamic features to capture the temporal changes associated with disease progression.\n\nThe selection of these features was performed using the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) feature selection algorithm. This method considers all features jointly to identify a minimal set that maximally differentiates the classes while minimizing redundancy. The process involves training a support vector machine (SVM) nonlinear classifier to recognize patterns that distinguish between the different clinical groups. For the AD vs. NC classification, the SVM was trained to recognize spatial-temporal thinning and brain network changes. For the P-MCI vs. S-MCI classification, the SVM utilized thickness values measured six months ahead of AD conversion, providing a short-term prediction of conversion from MCI to AD.\n\nThe chosen features were validated through their ability to improve classification accuracy significantly. For instance, the combination of static and dynamic features increased the accuracy from 89.6% to 94.8% for AD vs. NC and from 76.7% to 80.3% for P-MCI vs. S-MCI. Adding network features further enhanced the accuracy to 96.1% for AD vs. NC and 81.7% for P-MCI vs. S-MCI. This approach ensures that the selected features are not only relevant but also complementary, providing a robust model for classification.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized a combination of static, dynamic, and network features to enhance the accuracy of Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis and the prediction of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD conversion. The specific number of features used as input varies depending on the classification task.\n\nFor the classification task distinguishing between AD and normal controls (NC), we identified a set of optimal features that included both static and dynamic measurements, as well as network properties. These features were selected using the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) feature selection algorithm, which considers the relationships between all features to ensure complementary information and minimize redundancy. The selected features for this task are listed in a specific order, but this order does not indicate individual importance; rather, it reflects the best combination of features for classification performance.\n\nSimilarly, for the classification task distinguishing between progressive MCI (P-MCI) and stable MCI (S-MCI), we again employed the mRMR algorithm to select the most discriminative features. The features chosen for this task also include a mix of static, dynamic, and network measurements, with a notable inclusion of more dynamic features compared to the AD vs. NC task. This selection process ensures that the features used provide the most comprehensive information with minimal redundancy.\n\nThe feature selection process was performed using the training set only, ensuring that the selected features are unbiased and generalizable to new, unseen data. This approach helps in maintaining the integrity of the classification models and improves their predictive accuracy. The use of complementary information from different feature categories significantly enhances the classification performance, as evidenced by the improved accuracy in both classification tasks.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study involves a feature selection algorithm and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The mRMR (minimum redundancy maximum relevance) feature selection algorithm is used to identify the most relevant features while minimizing redundancy. This approach ensures that the selected features are jointly maximally differentiable for the classes, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting by avoiding the inclusion of redundant or irrelevant features.\n\nThe SVM classifier is trained to recognize spatial-temporal thinning and brain network changing patterns that distinguish between different clinical groups. For the discrimination between P-MCI and S-MCI, the thickness values measured 6 months ahead of AD conversion are used, providing a short-term prediction of the conversion from MCI to AD. This temporal aspect helps in capturing dynamic changes, which are crucial for accurate classification.\n\nTo address the potential issue of overfitting, the mRMR algorithm plays a critical role by selecting a minimal set of features that jointly maximize the differentiation between classes. This reduces the dimensionality of the feature space, making the model more robust and less likely to overfit the training data. Additionally, the use of a nonlinear SVM classifier allows for capturing complex patterns in the data, further mitigating the risk of overfitting.\n\nUnderfitting is addressed by ensuring that the selected features provide comprehensive information. The mRMR algorithm considers all features jointly, identifying a minimal set that maximally differentiates the classes. This ensures that the model is not too simplistic and can capture the necessary patterns in the data. The inclusion of dynamic and network features, in addition to static features, provides complementary information, enhancing the model's ability to accurately classify the different clinical groups.\n\nIn summary, the fitting method employs a feature selection algorithm and a nonlinear SVM classifier to balance the trade-off between overfitting and underfitting. The mRMR algorithm ensures that the selected features are relevant and non-redundant, while the SVM classifier captures complex patterns in the data, leading to improved classification accuracy.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our classification models. One key method used was feature selection via the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) algorithm. This approach helps in identifying a minimal set of features that jointly maximally differentiate the classes, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting by avoiding the inclusion of irrelevant or redundant features.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized support vector machines (SVM) with nonlinear classifiers, which are known for their effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces and their ability to generalize well to unseen data. The SVM classifier was trained to recognize spatial-temporal thinning and brain network changing patterns that distinguish between different clinical groups, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and normal controls (NC), as well as between progressive mild cognitive impairment (P-MCI) and stable mild cognitive impairment (S-MCI).\n\nTo further enhance the reliability of our measurements, we incorporated a 4D thickness measurement method that considers information from all time-points. This temporal-consistent approach helps in obtaining more accurate and robust longitudinal thickness measurements, which are crucial for distinguishing between different clinical groups.\n\nMoreover, we applied smoothing techniques using a Gaussian filter to suppress registration errors between subjects. This step helps in reducing inter-individual variation and improving the validity of statistical inferences, thereby contributing to the prevention of overfitting.\n\nIn summary, our study employed feature selection, SVM classifiers, temporal-consistent 4D thickness measurement, and smoothing techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our classification results.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in our study is not a black-box but rather a transparent one, as it leverages interpretable features derived from neuroimaging data. The features used in our classification tasks are categorized into static, dynamic, and network features, each providing distinct insights into the disease progression.\n\nStatic features, such as baseline and endline thickness measurements, offer a clear spatial pattern of cortical thinning, which is directly related to the disease's impact on the brain's structure. These features are easy to interpret, as they represent measurable changes in the thickness of specific brain regions.\n\nDynamic features, including thinning ratio and thinning speed, provide additional information about the rate and severity of cortical thinning over time. These features are also interpretable, as they quantify the progression of the disease. For instance, a higher thinning speed in certain regions, like the anterior prefrontal cortex and temporal gyrus, indicates a more rapid degeneration in those areas.\n\nNetwork features, such as the clustering coefficient of the thickness-change-revealed brain network, offer high-level information about the brain's connectivity and wiring efficiency. While these features are more complex, they are still interpretable in the context of how changes in brain connectivity relate to disease progression. For example, high correlations between network features and classification labels in regions like the parahippocampal cortex and temporal lobe suggest that these areas are critical in distinguishing between different clinical groups.\n\nMoreover, the use of the mRMR feature selection algorithm ensures that the selected features are both relevant and non-redundant, further enhancing the interpretability of the model. This algorithm helps in identifying the most informative features, making it easier to understand which aspects of the data are driving the classification results.\n\nIn summary, the model's transparency is maintained through the use of interpretable features that provide clear insights into the disease's impact on the brain. This transparency is crucial for validating the model's results and for gaining a deeper understanding of the underlying pathology.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in our study is primarily a classification model. We utilized a support vector machine (SVM) nonlinear classifier to distinguish between different clinical groups based on the features extracted from brain imaging data. The classification tasks involved differentiating between Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Normal Control (NC) individuals, as well as between Progressive Mild Cognitive Impairment (P-MCI) and Stable Mild Cognitive Impairment (S-MCI) subjects. The model's performance was evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation, and the results demonstrated improved accuracy with the inclusion of dynamic and network features in addition to static features.\n\nThe classification accuracy for AD vs. NC and P-MCI vs. S-MCI tasks was assessed using three different combinations of features: static, static+dynamic, and static+dynamic+network. The addition of dynamic and network features significantly enhanced the classification performance, indicating that these features provide complementary information that improves the model's discriminative ability.\n\nThe Receiver Operation Curves (ROC) for different classifiers with varying feature combinations were also provided to illustrate the model's performance. The optimal feature set for each classification task was selected using the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) feature selection algorithm, which ensures that the chosen features contain the most comprehensive information with minimal redundancy.\n\nIn summary, the model is designed for classification purposes, and the inclusion of dynamic and network features has been shown to enhance its performance in distinguishing between different clinical groups.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of our method involved several key steps to ensure its accuracy and reliability. We employed a feature selection algorithm known as mRMR (minimum redundancy maximum relevance) to identify the most comprehensive and least redundant set of features. This approach considers all features jointly to maximize class differentiation.\n\nWe trained a support vector machine (SVM) nonlinear classifier to recognize spatial-temporal thinning patterns and brain network changes that distinguish between Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and normal control (NC) individuals. For the discrimination between progressive mild cognitive impairment (P-MCI) and stable mild cognitive impairment (S-MCI), we used thickness values measured six months ahead of AD conversion. This allowed us to provide a short-term prediction of the conversion from MCI to AD.\n\nTo demonstrate the improved accuracy of our temporal-consistent 4D thickness measurement, we computed the correlation between thickness measurements and Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) scores for each subject in the P-MCI group. We then averaged these correlations. The P-MCI group was chosen because subjects in this group exhibit relatively large changes in thickness and clinical scores. We compared the results of our 4D method with a conventional 3D method, finding that the 4D method showed much higher correlations with clinical scores. We also provided a T-score map to indicate areas where the 4D measures gave statistically higher correlations, using False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction to control for multiple comparison errors.\n\nAdditionally, we computed 4D maps of the thickness thinning ratio within each clinical group. By averaging the thinning ratio maps of different subjects at corresponding time-points, we obtained mean thinning ratio maps for NC, S-MCI, P-MCI, and AD groups. These maps showed distinct cortical thinning ratios for each group, with NC having the least thinning and AD the most. This spatial distribution of cortical thinning indicated that dynamic features could provide valuable complementary information for classification, especially between P-MCI and S-MCI.\n\nWe also compared the thinning speeds of subjects in the P-MCI and S-MCI groups voxel-wise, adjusting for age and gender as confounding variables. The results showed significant differences in thinning speeds, particularly in the anterior prefrontal cortex, temporal gyrus, and parahippocampal area, which thinned faster in the P-MCI group. This suggests that incorporating dynamic features can help differentiate P-MCI subjects from S-MCI subjects.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our evaluation, we primarily focus on classification accuracy as our key performance metric. For the classification tasks, we report the accuracy percentages for different combinations of features. Specifically, we compare the performance of static features alone, static features combined with dynamic features, and static features combined with both dynamic and network features. This approach allows us to demonstrate the incremental improvement in classification accuracy as more types of features are incorporated.\n\nWe also report p-values to indicate the statistical significance of the improvements observed when adding dynamic and network features to the static features. This helps to validate that the enhancements in accuracy are not due to random chance.\n\nAdditionally, we provide Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for different classifiers with varying feature combinations. The ROC curves offer a visual representation of the trade-off between the true positive rate and the false positive rate, providing a comprehensive view of the classifier's performance across different threshold settings.\n\nThese metrics are chosen to be representative of the state-of-the-art in the field, aligning with common practices in the literature for evaluating classification performance in medical imaging and neuroimaging studies. The use of accuracy, p-values, and ROC curves ensures that our results are both rigorous and comparable to other works in the domain.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our evaluation, we conducted a thorough comparison of different feature combinations to assess their classification accuracy. We tested three distinct combinations: static features alone, static features combined with dynamic features, and static features combined with both dynamic and network features.\n\nFor the classification task of distinguishing between Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Normal Control (NC) individuals, the static features achieved an accuracy of 89.6%. However, when dynamic features were added, the accuracy significantly improved to 94.8%, with a p-value of less than 0.0001, indicating a statistically significant enhancement. The combination of static, dynamic, and network features further boosted the accuracy to 96.1%, with a p-value of less than 0.002, demonstrating the additional value of incorporating network features.\n\nIn the task of differentiating between Progressive Mild Cognitive Impairment (P-MCI) and Stable Mild Cognitive Impairment (S-MCI), the static features yielded an accuracy of 76.7%. The inclusion of dynamic features increased the accuracy to 80.3%, again with a p-value of less than 0.0001, showing a notable improvement. The most comprehensive combination, which included static, dynamic, and network features, achieved the highest accuracy of 81.7%, with a p-value of less than 0.003.\n\nThese comparisons highlight the incremental benefits of adding dynamic and network features to the static features, resulting in more accurate and reliable classification outcomes. The p-values associated with these improvements underscore the statistical significance of the enhancements observed.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "In our study, we have employed statistical measures to ensure the reliability and significance of our results. The performance metrics, specifically the classification accuracies, are accompanied by p-values that indicate the significance of improvement when compared to the static method. For instance, when classifying between AD and normal subjects, the addition of dynamic features improved accuracy from 89.6% to 94.8%, with a p-value of less than 0.0001, indicating a highly significant improvement. Similarly, for the classification between P-MCI and S-MCI, the accuracy improved from 76.7% to 80.3% with a p-value of less than 0.0001, and further to 81.7% with a p-value of less than 0.003 when network features were added. These p-values demonstrate that the improvements observed are statistically significant and not due to random chance.\n\nAdditionally, we used the False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction to control for multiple comparison errors, ensuring that the observed correlations between thickness measurements and clinical scores are robust and reliable. The T-score maps provided further validation by highlighting areas where the 4D thickness measures showed statistically higher correlations compared to the conventional 3D method. This rigorous statistical approach allows us to confidently claim that our method, which incorporates static, dynamic, and network features, is superior to baselines that rely solely on static features.",
