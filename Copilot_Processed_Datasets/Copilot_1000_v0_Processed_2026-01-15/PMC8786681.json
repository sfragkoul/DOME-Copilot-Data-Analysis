  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in our study was sourced from clinicopathological data obtained from preoperative examinations of patients with lower rectal cancer. The data points included in the dataset were from 323 patients, comprising 267 consecutive patients (500 sides) in the training cohort and 56 subsequent patients (107 sides) in the validation cohort.\n\nThe learning items included various clinicopathological factors such as age, sex, body mass index, serum carcinoembryonic antigen, and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels. Additionally, tumor characteristics like the distance from the anal verge, macroscopic type determined by colonoscopy, tumor diameter, circumferential rate of lumen, tumor localization of the rectal wall, histological type proven by endoscopic biopsy, and cT stage were considered. Imaging factors, specifically the short-axis diameter of the largest perirectal lymph node (PLN) and lateral lymph node (LLN) as detected on T2-weighted axial images of MRI, were also included.\n\nThe measurements of the lymph nodes were conducted by two researchers, one with 6 years of experience in colorectal surgery and the other with over 20 years of experience, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the data. The dataset was used to develop a prediction model for lateral lymph node metastasis (LLNM) from lower rectal cancer, leveraging machine learning techniques to analyze the data and create a predictive model.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into two main splits: the training cohort and the validation cohort. The training cohort consisted of 500 sides from 267 consecutive patients, while the validation cohort included 107 sides from 56 subsequent patients. The training cohort was used to develop the prediction model for lateral lymph node metastasis (LLNM) from lower rectal cancer, while the validation cohort was used to evaluate the predictive power of the model. The hold-out method was employed to create these splits, ensuring that the training cohort included data from April 2010, and the validation cohort included data up until March 2020. This division allowed for a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance and its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets were split using the hold-out method, where the training cohort consisted of 500 consecutive sides from April 2010, and the validation cohort included 107 subsequent sides until March 2020. This approach ensures that the training and test sets are independent, with the validation cohort being entirely separate in time from the training cohort. This temporal separation helps to enforce independence and reduces the risk of data leakage, where information from the test set might inadvertently influence the training process.\n\nThe characteristics of patients in both cohorts were presented in a table, showing some significant differences in the learning items between the cohorts. However, there was no significant difference in the rates of lateral lymph node metastasis (LLNM), indicating that the distribution of the primary outcome was comparable between the two cohorts. This comparison is crucial for validating the generalizability of the prediction model.\n\nThe use of a hold-out method with temporal separation is a robust approach to ensure the independence of training and validation sets, which is essential for evaluating the predictive power of machine learning models. This method aligns with best practices in machine learning to prevent overfitting and to ensure that the model's performance can be reliably assessed on unseen data.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data used in this study is not publicly available. The dataset consists of clinicopathological data obtained from preoperative examinations of patients with lower rectal cancer. This data includes various learning items such as age, sex, body mass index, serum carcinoembryonic antigen, and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels, among others. Additionally, measurements from MRI scans, specifically the short-axis diameter of the largest perirectal lymph node and lateral lymph node, were included.\n\nThe dataset was split into a training cohort and a validation cohort. The training cohort included 500 consecutive sides from April 2010, while the validation cohort included 107 subsequent sides until March 2020. This split was used to develop and evaluate the prediction model for lateral lymph node metastasis (LLNM) from lower rectal cancer.\n\nGiven the sensitive nature of patient data, it was not released in a public forum. The study ensured the privacy and security of patient information by analyzing anonymized data and using software that can operate without an internet connection, thus mitigating the risk of data leakage. The specific details of the data splits and the anonymization process were not disclosed to maintain patient confidentiality.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm used is not specified by name, but it is part of a software called \"Prediction One\" that utilizes \"Neural Network Libraries\". This software is designed to automatically perform machine-learning analysis, such as neural networks and gradient boosting trees, to create prediction models rapidly through cross-validation. The software is open-source and originally developed for nonmedical applications, but it has been applied in various medical fields.\n\nThe algorithm is not new, as it is based on established machine-learning techniques like neural networks and gradient boosting trees. The reason it was not published in a machine-learning journal is likely because the focus of the publication is on its application in predicting lateral lymph node metastasis from lower rectal cancer, rather than the development of the machine-learning algorithm itself. The software is an open-source tool, which means it is freely available for use and modification, and it has been applied in various fields beyond its original intended use.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model developed in our study is not a meta-predictor. It does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it relies on clinicopathological data obtained from preoperative examinations. This data includes various factors such as age, sex, body mass index, serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels, tumor characteristics, and imaging factors like the short-axis diameter of the largest perirectal lymph node and lateral lymph node as detected on MRI.\n\nThe machine-learning software used, \"Prediction One,\" automatically performs machine-learning analysis using neural networks and gradient boosting trees. It creates a prediction model through cross-validation, which calculates the predicted value by entering the items of each patient. The training data for this model is derived from a single institution's retrospective cohort, with the training cohort including 500 consecutive sides and the validation cohort including 107 subsequent sides. The independence of the training data is maintained by using a hold-out method, where the training and validation cohorts are distinct and sequential in time.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved using clinicopathological data obtained solely from preoperative examinations. This data included various patient characteristics and tumor features. Specifically, the learning items encompassed age, sex, body mass index, serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels, and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels. Additionally, tumor characteristics such as the distance from the anal verge, macroscopic type determined by colonoscopy, tumor diameter, circumferential rate of lumen, tumor location within the rectal wall, histological type proven by endoscopic biopsy, and clinical T stage were included.\n\nImaging factors were also considered, particularly the short-axis diameter of the largest perirectal lymph node and lateral lymph node, as detected on T2-weighted axial images of MRI. Two researchers, one with extensive experience in colorectal surgery and the other with specialized training, measured and matched the maximum lymph node diameter for each patient. These measurements were performed without knowledge of the presence of lymph node metastasis or patient prognosis, ensuring an unbiased assessment.\n\nThe data was then used to develop a prediction model using the machine-learning software \"Prediction One.\" This software automatically performs machine-learning analysis, such as neural networks and gradient boosting trees, to create a prediction model rapidly through cross-validation. The model calculates the predicted value by entering the items of each patient, facilitating the creation of an effective prediction model for lateral lymph node metastasis from lower rectal cancer.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized a comprehensive set of clinicopathological data obtained from preoperative examinations as input parameters for developing the prediction model for lateral lymph node metastasis (LLNM) from lower rectal cancer. The specific parameters included age, sex, body mass index, serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels, and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels. Additionally, tumor characteristics such as the distance from the anal verge, macroscopic type determined by colonoscopy, tumor diameter, circumferential rate of lumen, tumor localization within the rectal wall, histological type proven by endoscopic biopsy, and clinical T stage were considered. Furthermore, the short-axis diameters of the largest perirectal lymph node (PLN) and lateral lymph node (LLN), as detected on T2-weighted axial images of MRI, were included.\n\nThe selection of these parameters was based on their clinical relevance and potential influence on LLNM. Two experienced researchers, a doctor specialized in colorectal surgery and an expert colorectal surgeon, measured and matched the maximum lymph node diameter of each patient, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the data. This thorough selection process aimed to capture a wide range of factors that could impact the prediction of LLNM, thereby enhancing the model's predictive power.",
  "optimization/features": "The study utilized a comprehensive set of clinicopathological data obtained from preoperative examinations as input features for developing the prediction model. These features included age, sex, body mass index, serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels, and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels. Additionally, tumor characteristics such as the distance from the anal verge, macroscopic type determined by colonoscopy, tumor diameter, circumferential rate of lumen, tumor localization within the rectal wall, histological type proven by endoscopic biopsy, and clinical T stage were considered. Imaging factors, specifically the short-axis diameters of the largest perirectal lymph node and lateral lymph node as detected on T2-weighted axial images of MRI, were also included.\n\nThe selection of these features was based on their potential relevance to predicting lateral lymph node metastasis (LLNM) from lower rectal cancer. The process involved two researchers, one with specialized experience in colorectal surgery and the other an expert colorectal surgeon, who measured and matched the maximum lymph node diameter of each patient. This ensured that the features were accurately and consistently measured.\n\nFeature selection was implicitly performed by choosing clinically relevant and preoperatively diagnosable factors. The training cohort was used to develop the model, ensuring that the feature selection process was confined to the training set only. This approach helps in maintaining the integrity of the validation process and prevents data leakage, which could otherwise bias the model's performance.\n\nIn summary, the study used a combination of clinical, pathological, and imaging features, totaling around 20 distinct input features. Feature selection was performed using domain knowledge and was restricted to the training set to ensure robust and unbiased model development.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study utilized a machine learning approach facilitated by the software \"Prediction One,\" which leverages neural network libraries for deep learning. This software automatically performs machine learning analyses, including neural networks and gradient boosting trees, to create a prediction model through cross-validation.\n\nThe number of parameters in the model is indeed larger than the number of training points, which is a common scenario in deep learning models. To address the potential issue of overfitting, cross-validation was used. This technique involves partitioning the data into subsets, training the model on some subsets, and validating it on others. This process is repeated multiple times with different partitions to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.\n\nAdditionally, the model's performance was evaluated on a separate validation cohort, which included 107 subsequent sides. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in the validation cohort was 0.903, indicating strong predictive power. This validation step helps to confirm that the model is not overfitting to the training data.\n\nTo rule out underfitting, the model's performance was compared to a conventional method using the short-axis diameters of lateral lymph nodes (LLN) detected on MRI. The prediction model demonstrated significantly higher predictive power, with an AUC of 0.969 in the training cohort and 0.903 in the validation cohort, compared to the conventional method's AUC of 0.855 and 0.754, respectively. This comparison suggests that the model is sufficiently complex to capture the underlying patterns in the data without being too simplistic.\n\nFurthermore, the influential factors identified by the model, such as LLN diameter, carcinoembryonic antigen, body mass index, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, and perirectal lymph node (PLN) diameter, were consistent with known clinical indicators. This alignment with established medical knowledge provides additional confidence that the model is not underfitting.\n\nIn summary, the fitting method involved cross-validation to mitigate overfitting and comparison with a conventional method to ensure the model's complexity was appropriate, thereby avoiding underfitting.",

  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in our study is somewhat of a black box, as it utilizes machine learning techniques that do not inherently provide clear interpretability. The software used, \"Prediction One,\" automatically performs machine learning analysis and creates a prediction model through cross-validation. While the model identifies influential factors such as LLN diameter, carcinoembryonic antigen, body mass index, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, and PLN diameter in predicting lateral lymph node metastasis (LLNM), the specific details of how these factors interact within the model are not explicitly outlined. This lack of transparency is a common characteristic of many machine learning models, particularly those based on neural networks and gradient boosting trees. However, the model's predictive power is evident, as it outperforms conventional methods using MRI findings alone. Future work may involve exploring more interpretable machine learning techniques or methods to better understand the internal workings of the model.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in our study is a classification model. It is designed to predict the presence or absence of lateral lymph node metastasis (LLNM) in patients with lower rectal cancer. The model uses various preoperative clinicopathological data as learning items to generate a prediction. The output of the model is a predicted value that indicates the likelihood of LLNM, with a cutoff value of \u22650.101 used to classify patients as having LLNM or not. The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, which are typical for classification tasks. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was also calculated to assess the model's discriminative power. The model demonstrated high predictive accuracy, with an AUC of 0.969 in the training cohort and 0.903 in the validation cohort, indicating its effectiveness in classifying patients based on the presence of LLNM.",
  "model/duration": "The model creation process was notably efficient due to the use of \"Prediction One,\" a software that leverages deep learning libraries to perform machine learning analyses rapidly. This software automatically conducts analyses such as neural networks and gradient boosting trees, and generates prediction models through cross-validation.

It is designed to perform machine learning analyses, such as neural networks and gradient boosting trees, and to create prediction models rapidly through cross-validation.\n\nThe software can be used offline, ensuring that patient information remains secure and does not risk leakage. This makes it suitable for analyzing anonymized information without needing an internet connection.\n\nThe software was originally developed for non-medical applications but has shown potential for various medical fields. It automates the machine-learning process, making it accessible even to those without extensive technical expertise. However, specific details about the software's availability for public use, such as whether the source code is released or how to access it, are not provided.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the prediction model involved several steps to ensure its predictive power. Initially, a hold-out method was employed, dividing the data into a training cohort of 500 consecutive cases and a validation cohort of 107 subsequent cases. The training cohort was used to develop the prediction model based on various learning items, including clinicopathological data from preoperative examinations. These items encompassed age, sex, body mass index, serum carcinoembryonic antigen, and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels, among others.\n\nThe model's predictive power was then assessed using the validation cohort. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were measured to evaluate the discriminating power of the prediction model. The area under the ROC curves (AUC) was calculated to compare the model's performance with the conventional method, which relied on the short-axis diameter of the largest lateral lymph node (LLN) detected on MRI.\n\nThe Delong test was utilized to compare the ROC curves, ensuring statistical significance. Additionally, predicted cutoff values for LLNM were determined using the Youden index, which maximizes the sum of sensitivity and specificity. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the validation cohort were examined using these cutoff values.\n\nStatistical analyses, including Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables and the Mann\u2013Whitney U test for continuous variables, were conducted with EZR, a graphical user interface for R. All P-values were two-sided, with values less than 0.05 considered statistically significant. This comprehensive evaluation process ensured a rigorous assessment of the prediction model's effectiveness in predicting LLNM from lower rectal cancer.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our prediction model for lateral lymph node metastasis (LLNM) from lower rectal cancer, we employed several performance metrics to assess its effectiveness. The primary metric used was the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), which provides a comprehensive measure of the model's ability to discriminate between patients with and without LLNM. We reported the AUC for both the training and validation cohorts, demonstrating the model's predictive power.\n\nIn addition to the AUC, we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the prediction model. Sensitivity, also known as the true positive rate, measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified by the model. Specificity, or the true negative rate, measures the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified. Accuracy, on the other hand, provides an overall measure of the model's correctness by calculating the proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined.\n\nTo determine the optimal cutoff value for predicting LLNM, we used the Youden index, which maximizes the sum of sensitivity and specificity. This approach helped us identify a cutoff value that balanced the trade-off between true positive and false positive rates.\n\nWe also compared our model's performance with a conventional method that uses the short-axis diameter of the largest lateral lymph node (LLN) as detected on MRI. This comparison included evaluating the AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of both methods, providing a clear benchmark for our model's performance.\n\nThe reported metrics are representative of standard practices in the literature for evaluating predictive models in medical diagnostics. By including a range of metrics such as AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, we ensure a thorough assessment of the model's performance, making it comparable to other studies in the field.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we compared the predictive power of our machine learning model to a conventional method using the short-axis diameter of the largest lateral lymph node (LLN) as detected on MRI. This conventional method is a widely used diagnostic approach in clinical practice.\n\nThe comparison was performed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the curve (AUC) as the primary metrics. In the validation cohort, our prediction model demonstrated a significantly higher AUC of 0.903 compared to the conventional method's AUC of 0.754. This indicates that our model has a better discriminative ability for predicting lateral lymph node metastasis (LLNM) from lower rectal cancer.\n\nAdditionally, we evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of both methods. The prediction model achieved an accuracy of 80.4%, a sensitivity of 90.0%, and a specificity of 79.4%. In contrast, the conventional method with a cutoff value of 5 mm had an accuracy of 76.6%, a sensitivity of 50.0%, and a specificity of 79.4%. These results further support the superior performance of our prediction model over the conventional method.\n\nThe comparison was conducted using a hold-out method, where the training cohort consisted of 500 consecutive sides, and the validation cohort included 107 subsequent sides. This approach ensures that the comparison is based on independent datasets, providing a robust evaluation of the model's performance.\n\nIn summary, our study involved a direct comparison between our machine learning model and a conventional diagnostic method using benchmark datasets derived from clinical practice. The results clearly demonstrate the superior predictive power of our model, highlighting its potential for improving the diagnosis and treatment of lower rectal cancer.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the prediction model's performance included several key metrics, all of which were accompanied by confidence intervals to provide a measure of their reliability. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was a primary metric used to assess the model's predictive power. For instance, in the validation cohort, the AUC of the prediction model was reported as 0.903 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.832\u20130.974. This indicates a high level of confidence in the model's performance. Additionally, the conventional method had an AUC of 0.754 with a 95% CI of 0.578\u20130.930, showing a clear distinction between the two methods.\n\nStatistical significance was also a crucial aspect of the evaluation. The Delong test was used to compare the ROC curves of the prediction model and the conventional method, with a P-value of 0.022 indicating that the difference in performance was statistically significant. This suggests that the prediction model is superior to the conventional method.\n\nFurthermore, the predicted cutoff values for lateral lymph node metastasis (LLNM) were determined using the Youden index, which maximizes the sum of sensitivity and specificity. In the validation cohort, the prediction model achieved an accuracy of 80.4%, a sensitivity of 90.0%, and a specificity of 79.4%. These metrics, along with their associated confidence intervals, provide a comprehensive view of the model's performance and its superiority over the conventional method. All P-values reported were two-sided, and values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant, ensuring a rigorous standard for claiming the model's superiority.",
  "evaluation/availability": "The raw evaluation files are not publicly available. The evaluation process involved creating a prediction model using a software called \"Prediction One\" and comparing its predictive power with conventional methods. The evaluation metrics, such as the area under the ROC curve (AUC), were calculated and reported in the study. However, the specific datasets used for training and validation, as well as the detailed results of the evaluations, are not released publicly. The study mentions the use of statistical software EZR for analyses, but the raw data files themselves are not provided.
