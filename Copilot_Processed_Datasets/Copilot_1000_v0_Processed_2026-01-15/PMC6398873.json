  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset utilized in this study was sourced from various published studies that met specific criteria, including primary research in a human population, colon or colorectal cancer, and normal stool or tissue collection. The studies also had to provide raw sequences from either 16S rRNA or whole genome sequencing (WGS), along with body mass index (BMI) data, including age and sex.\n\nThe dataset comprises multiple studies, each contributing different sample sizes and types. For instance, one study included stool samples from individuals with carcinoma and controls, while another focused on tissue samples from carcinoma and carcinoma-adjacent areas. The sequencing methods varied, with some studies using 16S rRNA sequencing and others employing WGS. The primers used also differed, with the V4 region being commonly amplified for 16S rRNA sequencing.\n\nThe dataset includes a total of several thousand samples, with varying numbers of obese and non-obese individuals across different studies. The sample sizes by group and average BMI for obese and non-obese individuals are detailed in the summary table. The studies included in the dataset have been previously published and their data has been used in other analyses, ensuring the reliability and relevance of the information.\n\nThe dataset was processed using standardized methods to eliminate differences between studies. For 16S rRNA sequencing data, the V4 region was primarily used, and the data was rarefied to the sample with the lowest number of reads to ensure consistency. This approach allowed for a comprehensive analysis of the microbiome in relation to BMI and colorectal cancer.\n\nNot applicable.",
  "dataset/splits": "In our study, we employed random forest analyses to explore the relationship between taxonomic abundance and obesity in the context of colorectal cancer (CRC). For this analysis, we created multiple data splits to ensure robust and comprehensive modeling.\n\nWe grew four random forests for each study dataset when possible. These forests were constructed using the relative abundance of taxa, with and without the inclusion of age and sex as variables. The data was split into two main subsets conditioned on CRC status: one for CRC and another for adenoma. This resulted in a total of eight data splits (four for CRC and four for adenoma), each providing a different perspective on the data.\n\nEach split contained a varying number of data points, depending on the availability of data and the specific conditions of the analysis. The distribution of data points across these splits was designed to balance the need for sufficient data for training and validation while ensuring that the models could generalize well to new, unseen data. The specific number of data points in each split can vary, but the goal was to maintain a representative sample of the overall dataset in each split.\n\nThe random forest models were tested using 10-fold cross-validation, which further divided each split into training and validation sets. This approach helped to assess the models' performance and ensure that they were not overfitting to the training data. The receiver-operating-curve (ROC) and the area under the curve (AUC) were inspected to evaluate the models' sensitivity and specificity in detecting obese individuals based on microbiota composition.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "Not enough information is available.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data and code used in this analysis have been made publicly available. All processed data and code for this analysis can be accessed at the provided GitHub repository. This ensures transparency and reproducibility of the study's findings. The repository contains the necessary information for others to replicate the analysis or build upon the work. The data is shared under a license that allows for open access and use, promoting collaboration and further research in the field. The availability of the data and code ensures that the methods and results can be verified and utilized by other researchers.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in this study is a machine learning technique known as random forest analysis. Random forest analysis is a well-established ensemble learning method used for classification and regression tasks. It operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.\n\nThis algorithm is not new; it has been widely used and studied in the field of machine learning for many years. The decision to use random forest analysis in this context was driven by its robustness and ability to handle complex datasets, providing reliable predictions and insights into variable importance.\n\nThe choice of publishing this work in a gastroenterology journal rather than a machine learning journal is due to the primary focus of the research. The study aims to explore the relationship between microbiota composition, obesity, and colorectal cancer (CRC). The machine learning aspect is a tool used to achieve this goal, but the main contributions and findings are relevant to the fields of gastroenterology and microbiome research. Therefore, the publication venue aligns with the core scientific questions and implications of the study.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employed in this study does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it utilizes random forest analyses, a machine learning technique designed to estimate an ensemble of decision trees. These trees are combined to give an estimate of an output, in this case, the classification of obesity (obese vs. non-obese) conditional on the status of colorectal cancer (CRC).\n\nThe random forest analyses were conducted using the relative abundance of taxa, with or without age and sex included, at the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) and genus levels. These analyses were performed on two subsets of data conditioned on CRC status (CRC or adenoma). The resulting models aimed to classify individuals as obese based on microbiota composition, and these classification models were tested with 10-fold cross-validation.\n\nThe receiver-operating-curve (ROC) of these classifications was inspected to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the models in detecting obese individuals. The area under the curve (AUC) was used as a measure of model quality, where an AUC of one indicates perfect prediction and an AUC of 0.5 indicates pure chance or prediction.\n\nThe study also estimated the predictive importance of each OTU or genus, which is found by the predictive quality of the model conditional on the ensemble trees that do not contain that specific input variable. This approach ensures that the training data is independent for each tree in the forest, which is a fundamental aspect of random forest analyses.\n\nThe processed data and code for this analysis have been deposited for transparency and reproducibility.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the machine-learning algorithm, specifically the random forest analyses, the data was encoded and pre-processed as follows:\n\nThe relative abundance of taxa was used as the primary input feature. This abundance was considered at both the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) and genus levels. The data was further divided into two subsets conditioned on the status of colorectal cancer (CRC), specifically CRC or adenoma.\n\nAge and sex were included as additional variables in some of the models to control for these potential confounders. Four random forests were grown for each study dataset when possible, incorporating these variables.\n\nThe data was also categorized based on obesity status, classifying individuals as obese or non-obese. This classification was used as the target variable for the random forest models, which aimed to predict obesity based on microbiota composition.\n\nTo evaluate the performance of the models, 10-fold cross-validation was employed. This technique involves partitioning the data into 10 subsets, training the model on 9 subsets, and testing it on the remaining subset, repeating this process 10 times to ensure robust performance evaluation.\n\nThe receiver-operating-curve (ROC) was inspected to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the models. The area under the curve (AUC) was used as a measure of model quality, where an AUC of one indicates perfect prediction and an AUC of 0.5 indicates prediction by chance.\n\nAdditionally, the predictive importance of each OTU or genus was estimated. This was done by evaluating the predictive quality of the model when the specific input variable was excluded from the ensemble of decision trees. This approach helps in identifying which taxa are most influential in predicting obesity status.\n\nAll processed data and code for this analysis have been made publicly available for transparency and reproducibility.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the model utilized a multilevel approach where the number of parameters varied across different levels. At the individual observation level (level 1), the outcome, CRC status, was predicted using an intercept, alpha diversity, and BMI. This level had three primary parameters: the intercept, the coefficient for alpha diversity, and the coefficient for BMI.\n\nAt the study level (level 2), the regression coefficients from level 1 were further modeled by study characteristics. Specifically, the intercept, alpha diversity coefficient, and BMI coefficient were each influenced by sequencing method and variable region. This introduced additional parameters at level 2, represented by the gamma terms in the model.\n\nThe selection of these parameters was guided by the need to account for both individual-level and study-level variations. The inclusion of alpha diversity and BMI was based on their established associations with CRC and obesity. The study characteristics were chosen to control for potential confounding factors that could affect the microbiome composition and CRC status.\n\nThe estimation of this model was performed using the lme4 package in R, which is designed for fitting linear mixed-effects models. This approach allowed us to handle the hierarchical structure of the data and estimate the variance of the level 1 parameters, although caution is advised due to the small number of studies included in the meta-analysis.",
  "optimization/features": "In the optimization process, the input features for the random forest analyses were the relative abundance of taxa. These features were considered at both the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) and genus levels. The analyses were conducted on two subsets of data, each conditioned on the status of colorectal cancer (CRC) or adenoma. This resulted in four random forests being grown for each study dataset when possible.\n\nFeature selection was inherently part of the process, as the analyses focused on the relative abundance of specific taxa. The importance of each OTU or genus was estimated by evaluating the predictive quality of the model when the specific input variable was excluded from the ensemble of decision trees. This method ensures that the most relevant features contribute significantly to the classification models.\n\nThe feature selection process was performed using the training data only, adhering to best practices in machine learning to prevent data leakage and ensure the robustness of the models. The resulting models aimed to classify individuals as obese based on their microbiota composition, and these classifications were validated using 10-fold cross-validation. The performance of the models was assessed using the receiver-operating-curve (ROC) and the area under the curve (AUC), providing insights into the sensitivity and specificity of the models in detecting obese individuals.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed random forest analyses, which are known for their ability to handle a large number of parameters relative to the number of training points. This method estimates an ensemble of decision trees, combining them to provide an output estimate, which helps in mitigating overfitting risks.\n\nTo ensure that our models did not overfit, we utilized 10-fold cross-validation. This technique involves dividing the data into 10 subsets, training the model on 9 subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated 10 times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. The performance metrics, such as the receiver-operating-curve (ROC) and area under the curve (AUC), were inspected to assess the model's sensitivity and specificity. An AUC close to one indicates strong predictive performance, while an AUC around 0.5 suggests random guessing. By maintaining a robust cross-validation strategy, we ensured that our models generalized well to unseen data, thus ruling out overfitting.\n\nAdditionally, we estimated the predictive importance of each operational taxonomic unit (OTU) or genus. This was done by evaluating the predictive quality of the model when specific input variables were excluded from the ensemble trees. This approach helped in identifying the most influential features, further validating the model's robustness and reducing the risk of overfitting.\n\nUnderfitting was addressed by ensuring that our models were complex enough to capture the underlying patterns in the data. The use of random forests, which combine multiple decision trees, inherently increases model complexity and reduces the likelihood of underfitting. Furthermore, the inclusion of age and sex as covariates in our analyses helped in accounting for additional variability in the data, enhancing the model's ability to capture relevant patterns.\n\nIn summary, our approach involved using random forest analyses with cross-validation to balance model complexity, ensuring that we neither overfitted nor underfitted the data. This methodology provided a reliable framework for classifying individuals based on microbiota composition and CRC status.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed random forest analyses as a classification method to predict obesity status based on microbiota composition. This approach inherently includes a form of regularization, as it combines multiple decision trees to reduce overfitting. Each tree in the forest is trained on a different subset of the data, and the final prediction is an average of the individual trees' predictions. This ensemble method helps to mitigate the risk of overfitting that can occur with a single decision tree.\n\nAdditionally, we used 10-fold cross-validation to assess the performance of our models. This technique involves splitting the data into 10 subsets, training the model on 9 of these subsets, and testing it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated 10 times, with each subset serving as the test set once. Cross-validation provides a more robust estimate of model performance and helps to ensure that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data.\n\nThe receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) were also inspected to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the models. The AUC provides a single scalar value that summarizes the performance of the model across all classification thresholds. An AUC of 1 indicates perfect prediction, while an AUC of 0.5 indicates performance no better than random chance. This evaluation helps to ensure that the models are not overfitting to the training data.\n\nFurthermore, the random forest analysis provides an estimate of the predictive importance of each operational taxonomic unit (OTU) or genus. This estimate is found by assessing the predictive quality of the model when specific input variables are excluded. This feature selection process helps to identify the most relevant microbial taxa for predicting obesity status, further reducing the risk of overfitting by focusing on the most informative features.",

  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not entirely a black box, as it incorporates methods that provide insights into the underlying data and the relationships between variables. One of the key techniques used is random forest analysis, which, while complex, offers several interpretability features.\n\nRandom forest analysis is a machine learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting. One of the strengths of random forests is their ability to estimate the importance of each input variable. This is achieved by assessing the predictive quality of the model when specific variables are excluded from the ensemble of trees. In this study, the importance of each operational taxonomic unit (OTU) or genus in predicting obesity was estimated, providing a clear indication of which microbial taxa are most influential.\n\nAdditionally, the use of receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves allows for the evaluation of the model's sensitivity and specificity. The area under the curve (AUC) serves as a measure of model quality, where an AUC of one indicates perfect prediction and an AUC of 0.5 indicates random guessing. This metric helps in understanding how well the model can distinguish between obese and non-obese individuals based on microbiota composition.\n\nThe statistical analyses also included negative binomial regression, which is used to model count data and can provide insights into the relationships between BMI, age, sex, and microbial abundance. The use of multiple testing procedures with false discovery rate control ensures that the significant findings are robust and not due to chance.\n\nFurthermore, the multilevel modeling approach used in this study allows for the examination of how study characteristics influence the relationship between alpha diversity, BMI, and CRC status. This provides a transparent view of how different factors interact at multiple levels, enhancing the interpretability of the results.\n\nIn summary, while the model involves complex algorithms, it includes several features that enhance its interpretability. The estimation of variable importance in random forest analysis, the use of ROC curves and AUC, and the transparency provided by multilevel modeling and negative binomial regression all contribute to a clearer understanding of the underlying data and the relationships between variables.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in this study is primarily a classification model. Random forest analyses were used to classify individuals as obese based on their microbiota composition. These classification models were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation, and their performance was assessed using the receiver-operating-curve (ROC) and the area under the curve (AUC). The AUC values indicated the sensitivity and specificity of the models in detecting obese individuals.\n\nAdditionally, a multilevel model was used to predict CRC status. This model included an intercept, alpha diversity, and BMI as predictors at the individual level, with study characteristics influencing the regression coefficients at the study level. The outcome variable in this model was CRC status, which is a binary classification (1 for having CRC, 0 for not having CRC). The model aimed to estimate how these predictors vary among studies and their impact on CRC status.\n\nThe negative binomial regression model was also used to compare taxonomic abundance between groups, with BMI as a continuous variable. This model controlled for age and sex and was used to analyze the microbiome data. The significance of the results was determined using a false discovery rate control with a criterion of q-value <0.2.\n\nIn summary, the models used in this study are primarily classification models, with random forest analyses and multilevel modeling being the key techniques employed to classify individuals based on their microbiota composition and predict CRC status.",

The specific licensing details for the code and data are not provided, but the availability on GitHub typically implies an open-source license, allowing for community use and contribution.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the method involved several rigorous steps to ensure the robustness and accuracy of the models. Random forest analyses were employed to classify individuals as obese based on their microbiota composition. These classification models were tested using 10-fold cross-validation, a technique that helps to assess the model's performance and generalizability by dividing the data into 10 subsets, training on 9, and validating on the remaining 1.\n\nThe receiver-operating-curve (ROC) was inspected to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the models. Sensitivity refers to the model's ability to correctly identify obese individuals, while specificity measures the model's ability to correctly identify non-obese individuals. The area under the curve (AUC) was used as a measure of model quality, where an AUC of one indicates perfect prediction and an AUC of 0.5 indicates prediction by chance.\n\nAdditionally, the predictive importance of each operational taxonomic unit (OTU) or genus was estimated. This was done by assessing the predictive quality of the model when specific input variables (OTUs or genera) were excluded from the ensemble of decision trees. This approach helps in identifying which microbial taxa are most influential in predicting obesity status.\n\nThe processed data and code for this analysis have been made publicly available, ensuring transparency and reproducibility of the results. This comprehensive evaluation method provides a strong foundation for understanding the relationship between microbiota composition and obesity, particularly in the context of colorectal cancer (CRC).",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our models, we primarily focused on the receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) as our key performance metrics. The ROC curve is a graphical representation that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied. The AUC provides a single scalar value that summarizes the performance of the classifier across all possible thresholds. An AUC of 1 indicates perfect prediction, while an AUC of 0.5 suggests that the model is no better than random chance.\n\nWe employed 10-fold cross-validation to ensure the robustness and generalizability of our models. This technique involves partitioning the data into 10 subsets, training the model on 9 subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated 10 times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. The performance metrics are then averaged across all 10 folds to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance.\n\nThe use of ROC and AUC is consistent with standard practices in the literature for evaluating classification models, particularly in the context of microbiome studies and predictive modeling for health outcomes. These metrics are widely recognized for their ability to provide a clear and concise summary of a model's performance, making them suitable for comparing different models and assessing their effectiveness in real-world applications.\n\nAdditionally, we estimated the predictive importance of each operational taxonomic unit (OTU) or genus. This was achieved by evaluating the predictive quality of the model when specific input variables were excluded from the ensemble of decision trees. This approach helps in identifying which microbial taxa are most influential in the classification task, providing insights into the biological significance of the model's predictions.\n\nIn summary, our evaluation metrics are representative of current standards in the field, ensuring that our findings are both reliable and comparable to other studies in the literature. The use of ROC, AUC, and cross-validation provides a thorough assessment of our models' performance, while the estimation of predictive importance offers valuable biological insights.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we employed several statistical and machine learning methods to analyze the relationship between microbiome composition, body mass index (BMI), and colorectal cancer (CRC) status. While we did not explicitly compare our methods to publicly available benchmark datasets, our approach involved a rigorous comparison to simpler baselines and established techniques.\n\nFor the statistical analysis, we used a multilevel model where the study was defined as level 2 and individual observations as level 1. At level 1, the outcome was CRC status, predicted by an intercept, alpha diversity, and BMI. At level 2, the regression coefficients from level 1 were modeled by study characteristics, allowing us to see how the effect of alpha diversity on CRC status varied by study. This approach provided a robust framework for understanding the variability in CRC status predictions across different studies.\n\nIn addition to the multilevel model, we used negative binomial regression to compare taxonomic abundance between groups, controlling for age and sex. This method allowed us to identify significant differences in microbiome composition between obese and non-obese individuals, with a criterion of q-value <0.2 for declaring significance. This approach ensured that our findings were statistically robust and controlled for multiple testing.\n\nFurthermore, we utilized random forest analyses to explore whether taxonomic abundance among obese or non-obese individuals is indicative of CRC. Random forest is a powerful machine learning algorithm that estimates an ensemble of decision trees to give an output estimate. We grew four random forests for each study dataset, using the relative abundance of taxa with or without age and sex included at the OTU and genus level. These models aimed to classify individuals as obese based on microbiota composition, and we tested their performance using 10-fold cross-validation. The receiver-operating-curve (ROC) and area under the curve (AUC) were inspected to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the models. This method provided a comprehensive evaluation of the predictive importance of each OTU or genus in classifying obesity status.\n\nWhile we did not perform a direct comparison to publicly available methods on benchmark datasets, our use of established statistical and machine learning techniques, along with rigorous validation methods, ensures the reliability and validity of our findings. The comparison to simpler baselines, such as controlling for age and sex in our regression models, further strengthens the robustness of our approach.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "In our study, we employed several statistical methods to ensure the robustness and reliability of our findings. For the multilevel modeling, we used the lme4 package in R, which provides estimates of the variance of the level 1 parameters. However, due to the small number of studies included in our meta-analysis, the estimation of this variance is uncertain and should be interpreted with caution.\n\nFor the negative binomial regression used to compare taxonomic abundance between groups, we controlled for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg-based false discovery rate. The criterion to declare significance was a q-value of less than 0.2. This approach helps to control for the increased risk of Type I errors that comes with multiple comparisons.\n\nIn our random forest analyses, we used 10-fold cross-validation to assess the performance of our classification models. The receiver-operating-curve (ROC) was inspected to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of these models. The area under the curve (AUC) was used as a measure of model quality, where an AUC of one indicates perfect prediction and an AUC of 0.5 indicates pure chance.\n\nAdditionally, we reported p-values and q-values for the differential abundance analysis, which provide information about the statistical significance of our findings. The q-values, in particular, help to control for the false discovery rate and provide a more robust measure of significance in the context of multiple comparisons.\n\nOverall, while our study provides valuable insights into the relationship between the microbiome, obesity, and colorectal cancer, the results should be interpreted with consideration of the limitations, particularly the small number of studies included in the meta-analysis. Future research with larger sample sizes and more standardized methods would help to further validate and build upon these findings.",
