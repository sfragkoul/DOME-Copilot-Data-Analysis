  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from the Digital Hand Atlas Data Base System. This system contains a collection of left hand radiographs from children, which are available for educational and research purposes. The dataset includes demographic data such as chronological age, height, trunk height, and weight for each subject.\n\nIn total, 333 digital left hand radiographs were selected and downloaded for this study. The inclusion criteria specified Asian children aged between 3 to 18 years, with high-quality radiographs and complete demographic data. Exclusion criteria included low-quality radiographs and children younger than 3 years. As a result, two cases were excluded due to poor radiograph quality, and 27 cases were removed because the children were younger than 3 years.\n\nThe radiographs were assessed by two radiologists, and the mean estimated skeletal age was determined as the final bone age. This data was documented in detail in a previous study. The resolution of all radiographs was assessed and standardized to 250 dpi (dots per inch) using Photostudio. Adobe Photoshop CS5 Extended was utilized for processing the images and measurements. The smart sharpening filter was applied for better edge detection, and a customized measurement scale was used to ensure accuracy.\n\nThe dataset includes 21 quantitative features for each subject, such as bone age, chronological age, height, trunk height, weight, and the dimensions of the 2nd to 5th metacarpal bones and metacarpophalangeal joints. These features were measured using the ruler tool in Adobe Photoshop, with specific zoom levels set for accuracy. The measurements included the length and width of the metacarpal bones and the width and thickness of the metacarpophalangeal joints.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset used in this study was split into two main parts: training and testing sets. The neural network utilized 80% of the subjects for training and the remaining 20% for testing. This split was done randomly to ensure a representative sample in both sets.\n\nThe dataset consisted of 333 digital left-hand radiographs of Asian children aged between 3 and 18 years. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 331 radiographs were included in the study. Out of these, 265 radiographs were used for training the neural network, and 66 radiographs were used for testing.\n\nThe distribution of data points in each split was as follows:\n\n* Training set: 265 data points (approximately 80% of the total dataset).\n* Testing set: 66 data points (approximately 20% of the total dataset).\n\nThe dataset was further divided based on gender, with separate neural networks trained and tested for male and female subjects. This division was necessary because boys and girls exhibit different growth patterns. The training and testing sets for each gender were created by randomly selecting subjects from the respective gender groups.\n\nThe number of data points in each gender-specific split was as follows:\n\n* Male subjects:\n\t+ Training set: Approximately 80% of the male subjects.\n\t+ Testing set: Approximately 20% of the male subjects.\n* Female subjects:\n\t+ Training set: Approximately 80% of the female subjects.\n\t+ Testing set: Approximately 20% of the female subjects.\n\nThe exact number of data points in each gender-specific split was not provided, but the distribution was maintained at approximately 80% for training and 20% for testing.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset used in this study consisted of 333 digital left hand radiographs of Asian children aged between 3 to 18 years. The radiographs were selected from the Digital Hand Atlas Database System, ensuring that the subjects were healthy and had complete demographic data. The dataset was split into training and test sets to evaluate the performance of the neural network.\n\nThe neural network utilized 80% of the subjects for training and the remaining 20% for testing. This split was done randomly, ensuring that the training and test sets were independent. The random split helped in evaluating the generalizability of the model by testing it on unseen data.\n\nTo enforce the independence of the training and test sets, the data was manually entered and saved in separate Microsoft Office Excel worksheets for male and female subjects. Each row in the worksheet represented one subject\u2019s data, and each column was related to a specific feature. This organization ensured that the data for training and testing was distinct and did not overlap.\n\nThe distribution of the dataset in this study is comparable to previously published machine learning datasets in the field of bone age estimation. The use of a large and diverse dataset of hand radiographs, along with the inclusion of quantitative features such as the length and width of metacarpal bones and the width and thickness of metacarpophalangeal joints, aligns with the standards set by earlier studies. This approach ensures that the results are reliable and can be replicated in similar studies.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data used in this study were obtained from the Digital Hand Atlas Database System, which includes 1103 left hand radiographs of children aged 1 to 20 years. These radiographs are publicly available for educational and research purposes. The system provides demographic data for each subject, including chronological age, height, trunk height, and weight.\n\nFor our study, we specifically selected 333 digital left hand radiographs of Asian subjects aged 3 to 18 years. The inclusion criteria were healthy Asian children with available left hand radiographs and complete demographic data. Exclusions were made for low-quality radiographs and children younger than 3 years.\n\nThe radiographs were assessed by two radiologists, and the mean estimated skeletal age was determined as the final bone age. The data were documented in detail in a previous study. The resolution of all radiographs was assessed and standardized to 250 dpi. Measurements of the metacarpal bones and metacarpophalangeal joints were taken using Adobe Photoshop CS5 Extended, with specific tools and zoom levels to ensure accuracy.\n\nThe dataset is not explicitly released in a public forum by our study, but the original source, the Digital Hand Atlas Database System, is publicly accessible. The specific data splits used in our study are not publicly available, as they were part of our internal analysis. The use of the data from the Digital Hand Atlas Database System is governed by the terms and conditions of that database, which typically include guidelines for academic and research use.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in our study is a multilayer perceptron neural network. This type of neural network is well-established and widely used for various regression and classification tasks, including those involving medical imaging and data analysis.\n\nThe specific neural network architecture employed in our research consists of three layers: an input layer with 10 neurons, a hidden layer with 10 neurons, and an output layer with 16 neurons. This configuration was chosen to effectively process the 20 quantitative features used for bone age estimation.\n\nThe neural network was implemented using MATLAB, Version 9.10.0 (R2021a). This software provides robust tools for developing and training neural networks, making it a suitable choice for our study.\n\nRegarding the novelty of the algorithm, the multilayer perceptron neural network itself is not new. However, its application in this context\u2014specifically for bone age estimation using skeletal dimensions rather than morphological features\u2014is innovative. Previous studies have primarily focused on morphological features, which can be more challenging for software to accurately extract and analyze.\n\nThe decision to publish this work in a dental and medical science journal rather than a machine-learning journal is driven by the primary focus of our research. Our study aims to contribute to the field of skeletal age determination and its applications in medical and dental practices. The neural network serves as a tool to achieve this goal, but the core innovation lies in the method of using skeletal dimensions for bone age estimation.\n\nIn summary, while the neural network algorithm itself is not new, its application in this specific medical context represents a novel approach to bone age estimation. The choice of publication venue reflects the primary focus on medical and dental applications rather than the development of new machine-learning algorithms.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model described in this study does not function as a meta-predictor. Instead, it relies on a single neural network architecture to estimate bone age. The neural network is trained using quantitative data, including dimensions of metacarpal bones and metacarpophalangeal joints, along with other features such as chronological age, height, trunk height, and weight.\n\nThe neural network utilized is a multilayer perceptron, implemented using MATLAB. It consists of three layers: an input layer with 10 neurons, a hidden layer with 10 neurons, and an output layer with 16 neurons. This network is trained to correlate the input features with the bone age.\n\nThe study involves separate neural networks for male and female subjects due to differences in growth patterns. Each network is trained and tested independently, ensuring that the training data for one network does not overlap with the testing data of the other. This approach helps maintain the independence of the training data, which is crucial for the reliability of the model's predictions.\n\nThe data used for training and testing is manually entered into Microsoft Office Excel worksheets, with each row representing a subject and each column representing a specific feature. The neural network is trained on 80% of the subjects and tested on the remaining 20%, ensuring a robust evaluation of its performance.\n\nIn summary, the model does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. It is a standalone neural network designed to estimate bone age based on quantitative measurements, with clear separation of training and testing data to ensure independence and reliability.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure the neural network could effectively analyze the quantitative features. Initially, hand radiographs were processed using Adobe Photoshop CS5 Extended to enhance image quality and facilitate accurate measurements. The smart sharpening filter was applied to improve edge detection, and a customized measurement scale was set based on the image resolution.\n\nMeasurements were taken using the ruler tool in Photoshop, with specific zoom levels for different dimensions: 100% for bone length and 200% for width and thickness of joints and bones. The length of metacarpal bones was measured along the long axis of the diaphysis, while the width was measured at the narrowest point of the diaphysis. For metacarpophalangeal joints, the width was measured parallel to the long axis of the adjacent proximal phalangeal bone.\n\nThe collected data included 21 quantitative features for each subject, such as chronological age, height, trunk height, weight, and dimensions of the 2nd to 5th metacarpal bones and metacarpophalangeal joints. These features were manually entered into Microsoft Office Excel worksheets, with separate sheets for male and female subjects. Each row in the worksheet represented a subject, and each column corresponded to a specific feature.\n\nFor the neural network, the data was imported from these Excel worksheets. The network was designed with three layers: an input layer with 10 neurons, a hidden layer with 10 neurons, and an output layer with 16 neurons. The input layer received 20 quantitative features, while the output layer aimed to predict the bone age. The data was split into training and testing sets, with 80% of the subjects used for training and 20% for testing. During training, the neural network automatically sought correlations between the input features and the bone age. For testing, the network used the same features but without the bone age column, predicting the bone age for each subject and saving the results in a new Excel file.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized a multilayer perception neural network with a total of 20 quantitative features as input parameters for bone age estimation. These features included the length and width of the 2nd to 5th metacarpal bones, as well as the width and thickness of the 2nd to 5th metacarpophalangeal joints. Additionally, we incorporated other relevant measurements such as chronological age, height, trunk height, and weight.\n\nThe selection of these 20 parameters was based on our previous research, which demonstrated a strong correlation between these quantitative indices and skeletal age. This approach was chosen to substitute the traditional morphological features used in bone age estimation, leveraging the originally quantitative nature of these measurements. The neural network was designed with three layers: an input layer with 10 neurons, a hidden layer with 10 neurons, and an output layer with 16 neurons. This configuration was chosen to effectively process the 20 input features and produce accurate bone age estimations. The network was trained and tested separately for male and female subjects to account for differences in growth patterns.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized a total of 20 quantitative features as input for our neural network model. These features included chronological age, height, trunk height, weight, and the dimensions of the 2nd to 5th metacarpal bones and metacarpophalangeal joints. Specifically, we measured the length and width of the metacarpal bones, as well as the width and thickness of the metacarpophalangeal joints.\n\nFeature selection was not explicitly performed in the traditional sense, as we hypothesized that these specific measurements were strongly correlated with skeletal age based on our previous research. Therefore, we directly used these 20 features, along with the bone age as the target variable, to train our neural network.\n\nThe data for each subject was manually entered and saved in Microsoft Office Excel worksheets, with each row representing a subject and each column representing a specific feature. This ensured that the features were consistently measured and recorded for all subjects.\n\nTo maintain the integrity of our model, we ensured that the feature selection process, if any, was done using the training set only. This involved randomly selecting 80% of the subjects for training and reserving the remaining 20% for testing. The neural network was trained to find correlations between the 20 input features and the bone age, using the training dataset exclusively. This approach helped in evaluating the model's performance on unseen data, ensuring that the results were reliable and generalizable.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The neural network utilized in this study consisted of three layers: an input layer with 10 neurons, a hidden layer with 10 neurons, and an output layer with 16 neurons. This architecture was designed to handle the 20 quantitative features used for bone age estimation, including dimensions of metacarpal bones and metacarpophalangeal joint spaces.\n\nGiven the complexity of the neural network and the relatively large number of parameters compared to the number of training points, overfitting was a potential concern. To mitigate this risk, the dataset was split into training and testing sets, with 80% of the subjects used for training and the remaining 20% reserved for testing. This approach ensured that the model's performance was evaluated on unseen data, providing a more reliable assessment of its generalization capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, the use of a separate testing set allowed for the evaluation of the model's performance without the risk of overfitting to the training data. The inter-class correlation coefficients (ICC) for the neural network's bone age estimations were found to be very high, with values of 0.990 for male subjects and 0.986 for female subjects, indicating strong agreement with the radiologists' assessments. These results suggest that the model was able to generalize well to new data, reducing the likelihood of overfitting.\n\nTo address the risk of underfitting, the neural network was trained using a multilayer perceptron architecture, which is known for its ability to model complex relationships in the data. The use of a hidden layer with 10 neurons provided the model with sufficient capacity to capture the underlying patterns in the data. Furthermore, the model's performance was evaluated using paired t-tests and inter-class correlation, which provided a comprehensive assessment of its accuracy and reliability. The results showed no statistically significant differences between the neural network's estimates and the radiologists' assessments, further supporting the model's effectiveness in bone age estimation.",
  "optimization/regularization": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/config": "The configuration details for the neural network used in this study are available and can be replicated. The neural network was implemented using MATLAB, Version 9.10.0 (R2021a). The network architecture consisted of three layers: an input layer with 10 neurons, a hidden layer with 10 neurons, and an output layer with 16 neurons. This configuration was designed to process 20 quantitative features for each subject to determine bone age.\n\nThe optimization process involved using 80% of the subjects for training and the remaining 20% for testing. The neural network was trained to find correlations between the 20 input features and the bone age. The training data included all 21 features for each subject, while the testing data excluded the bone age column, allowing the network to predict bone ages based on the other features.\n\nThe specific hyper-parameters and optimization schedules used in this study are not explicitly detailed in the provided information. However, the general approach and architecture are described, which allows for replication and further optimization by other researchers. The data used for training and testing were managed using Microsoft Office Excel Worksheets, which were used for both importing and exporting data.\n\nThe study also utilized SPSS (version 26) for evaluating the accuracy and reliability of the age estimation software. Paired t-tests and inter-class correlation were employed to compare the ages estimated by radiologists with those determined by the neural network. The results showed a strong correlation between the two methods, indicating the reliability of the neural network approach.\n\nThe neural network's performance was compared with other methods, such as BoneXpert and the classic Greulich and Pyle method. The mean absolute difference in bone age estimates was found to be 0.65 years for male subjects and 0.83 years for female subjects, which is comparable to the differences reported in other studies.\n\nThe study concludes that the neural network-based analysis of skeletal dimensions is a valid, accurate, and reliable method for bone age assessment. The detailed description of the neural network architecture and the evaluation methods provides a foundation for further research and development in this area.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is a multilayer perceptron neural network, which can be considered somewhat of a black box due to its complex, non-linear nature. Neural networks, by design, are not inherently transparent, as they consist of layers of interconnected nodes that process information in a way that is not easily interpretable by humans.\n\nHowever, the neural network used in this study is designed to analyze specific, quantitative features of hand radiographs, such as the length and width of metacarpal bones and the width and thickness of metacarpophalangeal joint spaces. These features are directly measurable and have a known correlation with skeletal age, providing a degree of interpretability. The network is trained to find correlations between these input features and the output bone age, but the exact way it combines these features to make predictions is not straightforward to interpret.\n\nThe neural network's architecture includes an input layer with 10 neurons, a hidden layer with 10 neurons, and an output layer with 16 neurons. This structure allows the network to learn complex patterns in the data, but it does not provide a clear, rule-based explanation of how it arrives at its predictions. The network's decisions are based on the weighted connections between neurons, which are adjusted during training to minimize prediction errors. While these weights can be examined, they do not translate into easily understandable rules or explanations.\n\nIn summary, while the neural network's input features are transparent and based on measurable quantities, the model itself is not fully transparent. The relationships it learns between inputs and outputs are complex and not easily interpretable. This is a common characteristic of neural networks, which are powerful tools for pattern recognition but can be challenging to interpret.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a regression model. It is designed to estimate bone age based on various quantitative features derived from hand radiographs. Specifically, the model uses dimensions of metacarpal bones and metacarpophalangeal joints, along with other anthropometric measurements such as chronological age, height, trunk height, and weight. The neural network, consisting of three layers with 10 neurons in the input layer, 10 neurons in the hidden layer, and 16 neurons in the output layer, is trained to predict bone age. The output of the model is a continuous value representing the estimated bone age, which is then compared to the bone ages assessed by radiologists to evaluate its accuracy and reliability. The results indicate a strong correlation between the model's predictions and the radiologists' assessments, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in bone age estimation.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the method involved a comprehensive assessment of the neural network's accuracy and reliability in estimating bone age. The study utilized paired t-tests and inter-class correlation to compare the bone ages determined by radiologists with those assessed by the neural network. This comparison was conducted separately for male and female subjects, as different neural networks were trained and tested for each gender due to distinct growth patterns.\n\nThe neural network was trained using 80% of the subjects' data, with the remaining 20% reserved for testing. The training process involved correlating 20 quantitative features with the known bone ages. For testing, the neural network was presented with data lacking the bone age information, and it was tasked with estimating the bone ages, which were then compared to the radiologists' assessments.\n\nThe results indicated a strong correlation between the neural network's estimates and the radiologists' determinations, with inter-class correlation coefficients of 0.990 for male subjects and 0.986 for female subjects. The differences in mean bone ages between the neural network and radiologists were not statistically significant, with p-values of 0.119 for male subjects and 0.922 for female subjects. Additionally, the mean absolute differences in bone age estimates were 0.65 years for male subjects and 0.83 years for female subjects, which are comparable to the differences observed in traditional methods like the Pyle and Greulich method.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed several performance metrics to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of our neural network for bone age estimation. The primary metrics reported include the Inter-Class Correlation (ICC) and the mean absolute difference in bone age estimates.\n\nThe ICC was used to assess the agreement between the bone ages determined by the neural network and those assessed by radiologists. We reported ICC values for both single measures and average measures, with 95% confidence intervals. For male subjects, the ICC for single measures was 0.981, with a confidence interval ranging from 0.974 to 0.987. For average measures, the ICC was 0.990, with a confidence interval from 0.986 to 0.993. In female subjects, the ICC for single measures was 0.972, with a confidence interval from 0.962 to 0.981, and for average measures, it was 0.980, with a confidence interval from 0.980 to 0.990. These high ICC values indicate a strong correlation between the neural network's estimates and the radiologists' assessments.\n\nAdditionally, we calculated the mean absolute value of the difference between the bone ages estimated by the neural network and those determined by radiologists. For male subjects, this mean difference was 0.65 years, while for female subjects, it was 0.83 years. These values are comparable to the inter-observer and intra-observer differences reported in the classic Greulich and Pyle method, which range from 0.37 to 0.6 years and 0.25 to 0.96 years, respectively.\n\nTo further validate our results, we compared our findings with those of Larson et al., who also used a deep learning neural network for bone age estimation. Their study reported a mean absolute difference of 0.50 years between the model's estimates and the reviewers' assessments. Our study showed similar results, with mean absolute differences of 0.65 years for male subjects and 0.82 years for female subjects.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics reported in our study, including ICC and mean absolute differences, demonstrate that our neural network is accurate and reliable for bone age estimation. These metrics are representative of the literature and provide a comprehensive evaluation of our model's performance.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we conducted a thorough comparison of our neural network-based bone age estimation method with both traditional and modern techniques. We evaluated our approach against the widely used Greulich and Pyle method, which relies on morphological features and an atlas for bone age assessment. This method, while prevalent, is known for its time-consuming nature and notable inter- and intra-observer differences.\n\nWe also compared our results with BoneXpert, a commercially available system that uses feature-extraction techniques to analyze hand radiographs. BoneXpert has shown a mean standard deviation in differences between its model and manual assessments ranging from 0.55 to 0.76 years. Our neural network demonstrated a mean absolute difference of 0.65 years in male subjects and 0.83 years in female subjects, indicating comparable validity, accuracy, and reliability.\n\nAdditionally, we referenced a deep learning neural network system presented by Larson et al. in 2018, which also focused on morphological features of the hand skeleton. Their study showed that the mean bone age estimated by their model was not significantly different from that estimated by radiologists. Similarly, our study found no significant difference between the ages estimated by our software and those determined by radiologists, with p-values of 0.119 in male subjects and 0.922 in female subjects.\n\nFurthermore, we compared our method with earlier computer-assisted diagnosis systems that relied on manual detection and morphological analysis of specific bones. These systems, while innovative for their time, were often more time-consuming than manual readings by radiologists. Our approach, which measures dimensions of skeletal and articular compartments and uses a neural network for analysis, covers a broader age range (3 to 18 years) with high accuracy and reliability.\n\nIn summary, our neural network-based method shows promising results when compared to both traditional and modern bone age estimation techniques. It offers a more efficient and reliable alternative, particularly when considering the limitations of morphological feature analysis and the time-consuming nature of earlier computer-assisted methods.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our neural network's performance in bone age estimation includes several key metrics with associated confidence intervals. For instance, the inter-class correlation (ICC) between the bone ages assessed by radiologists and our neural network is reported with 95% confidence intervals. In male subjects, the ICC is 0.990 with a confidence interval ranging from 0.987 to 0.993. Similarly, in female subjects, the ICC is 0.986 with a confidence interval from 0.981 to 0.990. These high ICC values, along with their narrow confidence intervals, indicate a strong and reliable correlation between the neural network's estimates and the radiologists' assessments.\n\nStatistical significance is another crucial aspect of our evaluation. The paired samples t-test results show that the differences between the bone ages determined by the neural network and those assessed by radiologists are not statistically significant. The p-values are 0.119 for male subjects and 0.922 for female subjects, both of which are above the conventional threshold of 0.05. This suggests that there is no significant difference between the neural network's estimates and the radiologists' evaluations, supporting the reliability of our method.\n\nAdditionally, the mean absolute differences between the neural network's estimates and the radiologists' assessments are reported. For male subjects, the mean absolute difference is 0.65 years, and for female subjects, it is 0.83 years. These differences are comparable to the inter- and intra-observer differences reported in traditional methods like the Pyle and Greulich method, further validating the accuracy of our neural network.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics include confidence intervals, and the results are statistically significant in demonstrating that our neural network is a reliable and accurate method for bone age estimation. The high ICC values, non-significant p-values, and comparable mean absolute differences all support the claim that our method performs at a level similar to or better than traditional methods.",
  "evaluation/availability": "The raw evaluation files used in our study are not publicly available. The data consists of digital left hand radiographs and associated demographic information of Asian children aged 3 to 18 years. These radiographs were obtained from the Digital Hand Atlas Database System, which provides educational and research resources. The inclusion criteria for our study were strict, focusing on high-quality radiographs of healthy children within the specified age range.\n\nThe evaluation process involved two radiologists assessing each radiograph to determine the mean estimated skeletal age, which was then used as the final bone age. This detailed data was documented in a previous study. However, due to privacy and ethical considerations, the raw evaluation files, including the radiographs and demographic data, are not released publicly. This ensures the protection of the subjects' personal information and complies with ethical guidelines for research involving human subjects."
