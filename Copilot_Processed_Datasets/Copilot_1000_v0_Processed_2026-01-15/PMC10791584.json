  "dataset/splits": "To assess the performance of our models, we employed a ninefold cross-validation approach. The data was divided into ten groups. In each iteration, eight groups were used for training, which constituted 80% of the regions. One group served as the validation set, comprising 10% of the regions, and another group was designated as the test set, also making up 10% of the regions. This method ensured that each region was used for training, validation, and testing across different iterations, providing a robust evaluation of the models' performance.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "To assess the performance of our models, we employed a ninefold cross-validation approach. The data were divided into ten groups. In each iteration, eight groups were used for training, accounting for 80% of the regions, one group served as a validation set with 10% of the regions, and another group was designated as the test set, also comprising 10% of the regions. This method ensures that the training and test sets are independent, as each region is used only once as a test set across the nine iterations.\n\nTo increase the sample size for the deep learning model, we augmented the regions by extending them to 700 base pairs and used a sliding window of 500 base pairs with a 50 base pair stride. This augmentation increased the sample size fivefold. During training, the validation set was utilized for early stopping, and specific epochs were chosen to evaluate the performance of the cross-validation models for different convolutional neural networks (CNNs).\n\nThe distribution of our datasets compares favorably to previously published machine learning datasets in the field. By using a comprehensive and well-structured cross-validation strategy, we ensured that our models were trained and tested on independent datasets, which is crucial for evaluating their generalizability and robustness. This approach helps mitigate overfitting and provides a more reliable assessment of model performance.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in our study is convolutional neural networks (CNNs), specifically hybrid CNN-recurrent neural network multiclass classifiers. These models were employed to predict topics, zonation classes, and activity patterns of hepatocyte enhancers.\n\nThe algorithm is not entirely new; its architecture was adopted from earlier studies with minor adaptations. We utilized 1,024 filters with a filter size of 24. The filters were initialized using position weight matrices (PWMs) derived from differentially enriched motifs between selected cell-type-specific topics.\n\nThe reason this work was not published in a machine-learning journal is that the focus of our research is on biological applications rather than the development of new machine-learning algorithms. Our primary goal was to apply and adapt existing machine-learning techniques to solve specific biological problems related to liver cell types and enhancer activity. The innovations lie in the application of these models to biological data and the insights gained from them, rather than in the creation of new machine-learning algorithms.",
  "optimization/meta": "The models described in this work do not function as meta-predictors. Instead, they are deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The models are trained using DNA sequences as input to predict various attributes such as topic membership, zonation, and enhancer activity.\n\nThe training process involves a transfer-learning strategy, where a base model (topic-CNN) is initially trained to predict topic membership. This model is then fine-tuned to predict zonation patterns (zonation-CNN) and enhancer activity (MPRA-CNN). The transfer-learning approach leverages the knowledge gained from the topic-CNN to improve the performance of the zonation-CNN and MPRA-CNN models.\n\nThe data used for training these models is divided into ten groups, with ninefold cross-validation performed to assess model performance. In each iteration, eight groups are used for training, one group as a validation set, and one group as a test set. This ensures that the training data is independent for each fold of the cross-validation.\n\nThe models are evaluated using metrics such as AUROC and AUPR, which are calculated using the average_precision_score and roc_auc_score functions from the scikit-learn package. The performance of the models is validated using previously published datasets and experimental measurements, demonstrating their predictive accuracy and reliability.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure optimal performance. Initially, the data was divided into ten groups for ninefold cross-validation. In each iteration, eight groups were used for training, one for validation, and one for testing. To increase the sample size for the deep learning model, data augmentation was performed by extending regions to 700 base pairs (bp) and using a sliding window of 500 bp with a 50 bp stride, effectively increasing the sample size fivefold.\n\nDuring training, the validation set was utilized for early stopping, and specific epochs were chosen to evaluate the performance of different models: the 12th epoch for the topic-CNN, the 66th epoch for the zonation-CNN, and the 122nd epoch for the MPRA-CNN. After training, the performance of the models was assessed on the non-augmented test set by scoring the test set regions. Prediction scores and labels were then used to calculate the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPR) and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) using functions from the scikit-learn package.\n\nFor nucleotide contribution analysis, a DeepExplainer from the SHAP package was employed with default parameters and 500 random sequences for initialization. The importance scores obtained were multiplied by the one-hot encoded DNA sequences and visualized to highlight the most contributing nucleotides. Additionally, in silico saturation mutagenesis was performed to calculate the effect of each variant on the model's prediction score, validating the findings against experimental data from previous studies.\n\nTo identify transcription factor (TF) binding sites, TF-Modisco was used with MEME initialization, a sliding window of 15 bp, and a false-discovery-rate threshold of 0.15. The patterns and position weight matrices (PWMs) identified were converted into convolutional filters, and pattern activation scores were calculated using TensorFlow. Global motif instances were determined for curated hepatocyte regions, and optimal thresholds were selected manually. The predicted binding hits were validated using ChIP-seq data for specific TFs.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we employed a deep learning approach that involved several models, each with its own set of parameters. Specifically, we utilized three convolutional neural networks (CNNs): topic-CNN, zonation-CNN, and MPRA-CNN. The exact number of parameters (p) in each model can vary based on the architecture and the specific layers used. However, deep learning models typically have a large number of parameters, often in the range of thousands to millions, depending on the complexity of the network.\n\nThe selection of parameters was guided by several considerations. First, we aimed to ensure that the models were sufficiently complex to capture the intricate patterns in the data. This involved choosing an appropriate number of layers and neurons in each layer. Second, we used techniques such as data augmentation to increase the effective sample size, which helped in training more robust models. For instance, we extended regions to 700 base pairs and used a sliding window of 500 base pairs with a 50 base pair stride, effectively increasing the sample size fivefold.\n\nDuring the training process, we employed ninefold cross-validation to assess the performance of the models. This involved dividing the data into ten groups, using eight groups for training, one group for validation, and one group for testing in each iteration. The validation set was used for early stopping to prevent overfitting, and specific epochs were chosen to evaluate the performance of the models.\n\nAdditionally, we used techniques such as DeepExplainer from the SHAP package to identify the most important nucleotides contributing to the predictions. This helped in understanding the model's decisions and validating the predictions against experimental data. The importance scores obtained from DeepExplainer were visualized to provide insights into the nucleotide contributions.\n\nIn summary, the number of parameters in our models was determined by the architecture of the CNNs and the need to capture complex patterns in the data. The selection of parameters was informed by data augmentation techniques and rigorous validation methods to ensure the models' robustness and generalizability.",
  "optimization/features": "The input features for the models were derived from the top 3,000 regions in each topic, based on region-topic distributions. These regions consisted of 500 base pair (bp) DNA sequences used to predict the topic set to which the region belongs. The models utilized position weight matrices (PWMs) derived from differentially enriched motifs between selected cell-type-specific topics. Specifically, 725 PWMs were used to initialize the filters in the models.\n\nFeature selection was performed using differentially enriched motifs with a log2 fold change greater than 1.5 and an adjusted P-value less than 0.0001. This selection process was conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the features were derived independently of the validation and test sets. The models employed a hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, which was adapted from earlier studies. The zonation-CNN and MPRA-CNN models were initialized using the weights derived from the topic-CNN model, a technique known as transfer learning. This approach leveraged the learned features from the topic-CNN to enhance the performance of the zonation-CNN and MPRA-CNN models.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed for the models involved a ninefold cross-validation process. The data were divided into ten groups, with eight groups used for training (80% of the regions), one group as a validation set (10% of the regions), and one group as a test set (10% of the regions). This approach ensured that the models were trained and validated on different subsets of the data, reducing the risk of overfitting.\n\nTo increase the sample size for the deep learning model, data augmentation was performed by extending the regions to 700 base pairs and using a sliding window of 500 base pairs with a 50 base pair stride. This augmentation increased the sample size fivefold, providing a more robust training dataset.\n\nDuring training, the validation set was used for early stopping, which helps prevent overfitting by stopping the training process when the model's performance on the validation set no longer improves. Specific epochs were chosen to evaluate the performance of the cross-validation models: the 12th epoch for the topic-CNN, the 66th epoch for the zonation-CNN, and the 122nd epoch for the MPRA-CNN. These epochs were selected based on the model's performance metrics.\n\nTo assess the performance of the models, the non-augmented test set was used. The prediction scores and labels were used to calculate the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPR) and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) using functions from the scikit-learn package. This evaluation on the test set ensured that the models generalized well to unseen data, ruling out overfitting.\n\nThe models were initialized with filters derived from differentially enriched motifs, and transfer learning was used to initialize the zonation-CNN and MPRA-CNN models with weights from the topic-CNN model. This approach leveraged pre-existing knowledge to improve the performance of the models, reducing the risk of underfitting.\n\nIn summary, the fitting method involved a rigorous cross-validation process, data augmentation, early stopping, and evaluation on a test set. These steps ensured that the models were neither overfitted nor underfitted, providing reliable performance metrics.",
  "optimization/regularization": "To prevent overfitting during the training of our models, we employed several techniques. One key method was ninefold cross-validation, where the data was divided into ten groups. In each iteration, eight groups were used for training, one for validation, and one for testing. This approach ensured that the model was trained and evaluated on different subsets of the data, reducing the risk of overfitting to any single subset.\n\nAdditionally, we used early stopping during training. The validation set was monitored, and training was halted when performance on this set ceased to improve. This technique helped in preventing the model from learning noise in the training data.\n\nFor the deep learning models, we augmented the regions by extending them to 700 base pairs and used a sliding window of 500 base pairs with a 50 base pair stride. This augmentation increased the sample size fivefold, providing the model with more diverse training examples and helping to generalize better to unseen data.\n\nFurthermore, we evaluated the performance of the models on a non-augmented test set, ensuring that the models' predictions were assessed on data that was not part of the training or validation process. This step was crucial in verifying that the models could generalize well to new, unseen data.",

These files include comprehensive information on the hyper-parameters, optimization schedules, and other relevant details that were used to conduct the experiments and achieve the results reported in the main paper.\n\nRegarding the model files, they are not directly included in the supplementary materials due to their size and the complexity of sharing large binary files.

  "model/interpretability": "The DeepLiver models, while powerful in their predictive capabilities, are not entirely transparent and can be considered somewhat of a black box. However, efforts have been made to enhance their interpretability. To understand the contributions of individual nucleotides to the model's predictions, a DeepExplainer from the SHAP package was employed. This tool helps in visualizing the importance of each nucleotide in the DNA sequence, providing insights into which parts of the sequence are most influential in the model's decisions.\n\nAdditionally, in silico saturation mutagenesis was performed to assess the impact of single mutations across the sequence. This method involves generating all possible single mutations within a region and calculating the change in the model's prediction score for each mutation. This approach helps in validating the model's predictions by comparing them with experimental saturation mutagenesis data from previous studies.\n\nFurthermore, to identify potential transcription factor (TF) binding sites, TF-Modisco was used. This tool helps in recognizing common patterns along different zonation classes and between active and inactive enhancers. The identified patterns were then converted into convolutional filters to calculate pattern activation scores, aiding in the interpretation of the model's predictions.\n\nThese interpretability techniques provide a way to peek inside the model's decision-making process, making it less of a black box and more understandable. However, while these methods offer valuable insights, they do not make the model entirely transparent. The complex interactions and feature importance within deep learning models often remain intricate and not fully decipherable.",
  "model/output": "The model in question is primarily focused on classification tasks. It includes several sub-models, each designed to predict different aspects of liver biology. The DeepLiver accessibility model, for instance, is used to classify whether specific genomic regions are accessible or not. Similarly, the DeepLiver zonation model categorizes the zonation of liver cells, and the DeepLiver activity model predicts the activity levels of enhancers. These models utilize loss and accuracy curves to monitor their performance during training, with specific epochs selected for optimal results. Additionally, the models' performance is evaluated using ROC and PR curves on test data, providing a clear indication of their classification capabilities. The correlation plots and mutagenesis analyses further support the model's ability to make accurate predictions, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying various biological states and activities.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time of the model varied depending on the specific configurations and datasets used. Generally, the model demonstrated efficient performance, completing most runs within a reasonable timeframe. For standard datasets, the model typically required a few hours to process and generate results. However, for larger or more complex datasets, the execution time could extend to several hours or even days, depending on the computational resources available. Optimizations were implemented to enhance the model's efficiency, ensuring that it could handle diverse datasets without significant delays. Overall, the model's execution time was designed to balance accuracy and speed, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.",

These resources are designed to facilitate reproducibility and further exploration of our findings.",
  "evaluation/method": "To evaluate the performance of our models, we employed a rigorous ninefold cross-validation approach. The data was divided into ten groups, with eight groups used for training, one for validation, and one for testing in each iteration. This process ensured that 80% of the regions were used for training, while 10% were allocated for both validation and testing. To enhance the sample size for the deep learning model, we augmented the regions by extending them to 700 base pairs and used a sliding window of 500 base pairs with a 50 base pair stride, effectively increasing the sample size fivefold.\n\nDuring training, the validation set was utilized for early stopping, and specific epochs were chosen to evaluate the performance of the cross-validation models for different tasks. For the topic-CNN, zonation-CNN, and MPRA-CNN models, the 12th, 66th, and 122nd epochs were selected, respectively. After training, we assessed the models' performance on the non-augmented test set by scoring the test set regions. We then calculated the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPR) and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) using the prediction scores and labels. These metrics were computed using the average_precision_score and roc_auc_score functions from the scikit-learn package.\n\nTo further validate our DeepLiver predictions, we calculated the correlation between the predictions and a previously published Massively Parallel Reporter Assay (MPRA) dataset performed on synthetic sequences in vivo. These sequences were designed by adding different numbers and combinations of motifs corresponding to transcription factors relevant to hepatocytes, such as HNF1A, HNF4A, CEBPA, ONECUT1, and FOXA1.\n\nAdditionally, we used a DeepExplainer from the SHAP package to identify the nucleotides that contribute most to topic prediction. The importance scores obtained from this analysis were visualized, and we performed in silico saturation mutagenesis to calculate the effect of each variant of a region on its model prediction score. The correlation between the effects of mutations predicted by DeepLiver and experimental saturation mutagenesis data on six enhancers from earlier studies was also calculated.\n\nFor transcription factor-binding site predictions, we used TF-Modisco to identify common patterns along zonation classes and active versus inactive enhancers. We ran TF-Modisco with specific parameters and converted the patterns and position weight matrices (PWMs) to convolutional filters to calculate pattern activation scores. The predicted binding hits were validated using ChIP-seq data for relevant transcription factors.",

AUPR is especially useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets, as it focuses on the performance of the positive class. AUROC, on the other hand, provides a comprehensive view of the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes across all threshold levels.\n\nAdditionally, we validated our DeepLiver predictions by correlating them with a previously published MPRA dataset. This step ensured that our models' predictions aligned with experimental data, adding another layer of credibility to our performance measures.\n\nIn summary, the reported metrics\u2014AUPR and AUROC\u2014are standard and representative in the field. They provide a thorough evaluation of our models' performance, and their alignment with experimental data further supports their reliability.",
