  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from patients diagnosed with liver cancer at our institution between 1999 and 2019. All patient data were fully anonymized prior to analysis. The inclusion criteria required the availability of preoperative contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) images and surgical excision or biopsy with pathological examination. Exclusion criteria included the lack of histopathological evaluation, incomplete clinical data, and substandard CEUS image quality.\n\nThe final study cohort consisted of 280 patients, evenly divided between those diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), with 140 patients in each group. This cohort was randomly split into a training set of 224 patients and a validation set of 56 patients. The training set included 112 HCC patients and 112 ICC patients, while the validation set included 28 HCC patients and 28 ICC patients.\n\nThe dataset includes clinical characteristics such as sex, age, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection status, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels, and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) levels. These characteristics were collected from admission records. The ultrasound images acquired included baseline US images, arterial enhancement (AE) images, and portal enhancement (PE) images. The largest liver lesion was targeted for patients with multiple lesions, and the ultrasound contrast agent Sonovue was administered to capture CEUS clips for analysis.\n\nThe dataset has not been used in previous papers by the community.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into two main splits: a training cohort and a validation cohort. The training cohort consisted of 224 patients, with 112 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 112 cases of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). The validation cohort comprised 56 patients, evenly split with 28 cases of HCC and 28 cases of ICC. The patients were randomly assigned to these cohorts, ensuring a balanced distribution of the two types of liver cancer in both the training and validation sets. This split was designed to facilitate the development and evaluation of radiomics models for differentiating between HCC and ICC.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset consisted of 280 patients, equally divided between those diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). The patients were randomly assigned to either a training cohort or a validation cohort. The training cohort included 224 patients, with an equal number of HCC and ICC cases (112 each). The validation cohort consisted of 56 patients, also evenly split between HCC and ICC (28 each).\n\nThe training and validation sets were independent, ensuring that the models were trained and tested on distinct data to avoid overfitting and to provide a reliable evaluation of their performance. This independence was enforced through random assignment, which helped in maintaining the integrity of the model evaluation process.\n\nThe distribution of the dataset in terms of patient characteristics, such as age, sex, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, and tumor size, showed no significant differences between the training and validation cohorts. This consistency in distribution is crucial for ensuring that the models generalize well to new, unseen data. However, notable differences were observed in the levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) between HCC and ICC patients, which were included as clinical characteristics in the radiomics model.\n\nCompared to previously published machine learning datasets in similar medical domains, the dataset used in this study is robust and well-balanced. The random splitting and equal representation of both HCC and ICC cases in both cohorts ensure that the models are trained and validated on representative samples, enhancing the reliability and generalizability of the results.",
  "dataset/availability": "Not applicable",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our study is a random forest algorithm. This is a well-established ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.\n\nThe random forest algorithm is not new; it has been extensively used and validated in various fields, including medical imaging and radiomics. Its robustness and ability to handle high-dimensional data make it suitable for our study, which involves a large number of features extracted from ultrasound images.\n\nThe choice of random forest for our specific application in differentiating between intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) images was driven by its effectiveness in capturing complex relationships within the data. This algorithm was selected for its ability to provide reliable and interpretable results, which are crucial in a clinical setting.\n\nGiven that random forest is a widely recognized and established algorithm, it was not necessary to publish it in a machine-learning journal. Instead, our focus was on applying this algorithm to a novel dataset and demonstrating its utility in a specific medical context. The innovation lies in the application of the algorithm to CEUS-based ultrasomics for ICC-HCC differentiation, rather than in the algorithm itself.",
  "optimization/meta": "The models developed in this study do not function as meta-predictors. Instead, they are individual radiomics models constructed using the random forest algorithm. Four distinct models were created: the US model, which uses ultrasound images; the CEUS model, which utilizes contrast-enhanced ultrasound images; the US + CEUS model, which combines both ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasound images; and the US + CEUS + CL model, which integrates ultrasound, contrast-enhanced ultrasound images, and clinical characteristics.\n\nEach of these models was trained and validated independently. The training cohort consisted of 224 patients, while the validation cohort included 56 patients. The models were evaluated using metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision. The performance of these models was compared to determine the most efficient one for differentiating between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).\n\nThe US + CEUS + CL model demonstrated the highest AUC values, indicating superior diagnostic accuracy. This model's performance was also compared to the diagnostic abilities of radiologists with varying levels of experience, showing that it outperformed less-experienced radiologists and matched the accuracy of the most experienced radiologist.\n\nIn summary, the models are standalone radiomics models, each utilizing different combinations of imaging and clinical data, and they were trained and validated on independent datasets.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several key steps. Initially, ultrasound images were acquired using convex array scanners with a frequency range of 1.0 to 6.0 MHz. For patients with multiple liver lesions, the largest lesion was targeted. The ultrasound contrast agent, Sonovue, was administered, and CEUS clips were recorded for 90 seconds following the injection. Additional images were captured at 120 seconds and subsequently every 60 seconds until the contrast washed out.\n\nThe ultrasound images obtained included baseline US images, arterial enhancement (AE) images showing peak enhancement of the target lesion, and portal enhancement (PE) images captured at 120 seconds. These images were manually segmented along the tumor contour by an abdominal radiologist with experience in liver CEUS, and the regions of interest (ROIs) were validated by a senior radiologist.\n\nImage preprocessing and feature extraction were performed using the Pyradiomics package. A total of 828 features were extracted from each ROI. The significance of each feature was calculated using XGBoost, and the top 20 significant features were selected for further analysis. The relationships among these features were assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient, and features with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.8 were discarded to avoid redundancy. The remaining features were chosen for subsequent analysis.\n\nA random forest algorithm was utilized to establish the radiomics model. Four models were developed and compared to determine the most efficient one: the US model (using US images), the CEUS model (using AE and PE images), the US + CEUS model (combining US, AE, and PE images), and the US + CEUS + CL model (integrating US, AE, and PE images with clinical characteristics). The number of features selected varied for each model, with 13 features for the US model, 15 for the CEUS model, 13 for the US + CEUS model, and 21 for the US + CEUS + CL model.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the number of parameters used in each model varied depending on the specific features selected. Initially, 828 features were extracted from each region of interest. The significance of each feature was calculated using XGBoost, and the top 20 significant features were selected for further analysis. The relationships among these features were then assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient, and features with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.8 were discarded to avoid redundancy. The remaining features were chosen for subsequent analysis.\n\nThe number of features selected for each model was as follows:\n\n* 13 features for the US model\n* 15 features for the CEUS model\n* 13 features for the US + CEUS model\n* 21 features for the US + CEUS + CL model\n\nThese selected features were then used to establish the radiomics models using a random forest algorithm. The models were developed and compared to determine the most efficient one. The final number of parameters in each model was determined by the number of features selected after the correlation analysis.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we initially extracted 828 features from each region of interest using the Pyradiomics package. To identify the most significant features, we employed the XGBoost algorithm, which helped us select the top 20 significant features for further analysis. To ensure that the selected features were independent, we assessed their relationships using the Spearman correlation coefficient. Features with a Spearman correlation coefficient greater than 0.8 were considered redundant, and the less significant ones were discarded. This process was conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the feature selection was unbiased and could be validated on the test set. Ultimately, the number of features selected varied by model: 13 for the US model, 15 for the CEUS model, 13 for the US + CEUS model, and 21 for the US + CEUS + CL model.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed a robust methodology to ensure that our models were neither overfitting nor underfitting the data. The number of parameters in our models was indeed larger than the number of training points, which is a common scenario in radiomics studies due to the high dimensionality of the feature space.\n\nTo mitigate overfitting, we utilized several strategies. Firstly, we selected the top 20 significant features using XGBoost, which helped in reducing the dimensionality of the feature space. Secondly, we assessed the relationships among these features using the Spearman correlation coefficient and discarded less significant features with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.8. This step ensured that we retained only the most informative and independent features. Additionally, we employed a random forest algorithm to establish the radiomics model, which is known for its ability to handle high-dimensional data and reduce overfitting through ensemble learning.\n\nTo address underfitting, we developed and compared four different models: the US model, the CEUS model, the US + CEUS model, and the US + CEUS + CL model. Each model incorporated different combinations of imaging and clinical data, allowing us to capture a wide range of patterns and relationships in the data. Furthermore, we evaluated the models using metrics such as AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision in both training and test cohorts. This comprehensive evaluation ensured that our models were generalizable and not overly simplistic.\n\nIn summary, by carefully selecting features, using ensemble learning, and thoroughly evaluating our models, we were able to balance the complexity of our models and ensure that they were neither overfitting nor underfitting the data.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our models. One of the key methods used was feature selection. We initially extracted a large number of features from the medical images. To avoid overfitting, we used XGBoost to calculate the significance of each feature and selected only the top 20 significant features for further analysis. This step helped in reducing the dimensionality of the data and focusing on the most relevant features.\n\nAdditionally, we assessed the relationships among the selected features using the Spearman correlation coefficient. Features with a Spearman correlation coefficient greater than 0.8 were considered highly correlated, and the less significant ones were discarded. This process further refined our feature set, ensuring that we retained only the most informative and independent features.\n\nTo build our radiomics models, we utilized a random forest algorithm, which is known for its ability to handle high-dimensional data and reduce overfitting through ensemble learning. The random forest algorithm aggregates the predictions of multiple decision trees, each trained on a different subset of the data, thereby improving the model's generalization performance.\n\nWe developed four different models: the US model (using US images), the CEUS model (using AE and PE images), the US + CEUS model (combining US, AE, and PE images), and the US + CEUS + CL model (integrating US, AE, and PE images with clinical characteristics). By comparing the performance of these models, we were able to determine the most efficient one and ensure that our findings were not due to overfitting to a specific type of data.\n\nIn summary, our approach to preventing overfitting involved feature selection using XGBoost and Spearman correlation coefficient, as well as the use of a random forest algorithm for model building. These techniques helped us to create robust and generalizable models for differentiating between HCC and ICC.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters used in our study are reported within the publication. Specifically, we utilized XGBoost to calculate the significance of each feature and selected the top 20 significant features for further analysis. The relationships among these features were assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient, and features with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.8 were discarded. The remaining features were then used to establish a radiomics model using a random forest algorithm.\n\nThe models developed include the US model (using US images), the CEUS model (using AE and PE images), the US + CEUS model (combining US, AE, and PE images), and the US + CEUS + CL model (integrating US, AE, and PE images with clinical characteristics). The performance of these models was evaluated using metrics such as the AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision.\n\nThe model files and specific optimization schedules are not explicitly detailed in the publication, as the focus was on the methodology and results of the models rather than the technical implementation details. However, the general approach and parameters used for model optimization are described, providing a clear understanding of the process followed.\n\nRegarding the availability and licensing of the configurations and parameters, the publication itself is available under the terms set by the publisher, Baishideng Publishing Group Inc. For detailed technical implementations, readers may need to refer to the specific software packages used, such as the Pyradiomics package for image preprocessing and feature extraction, and the random forest algorithm for model establishment. These tools typically have their own licensing agreements and documentation available through their respective repositories or websites.",
  "model/interpretability": "The models developed in this study are primarily based on machine learning algorithms, specifically the random forest algorithm, which are often considered black-box models. This means that while they can provide accurate predictions, the internal workings and the specific reasons behind these predictions are not immediately transparent.\n\nHowever, efforts were made to enhance the interpretability of the models. The significance of each feature was calculated using XGBoost, and the top 20 significant features were selected for further analysis. This step helps in identifying which features are most important in making predictions, thereby providing some insight into the model's decision-making process.\n\nAdditionally, the relationships among these features were assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient. Features with a strong correlation (Spearman correlation coefficient greater than 0.8) were discarded to avoid redundancy and ensure that the remaining features were independent and contributed uniquely to the model's predictions.\n\nThe models constructed include the US model (using US images), the CEUS model (using arterial enhancement and portal enhancement images), the US + CEUS model (combining US, arterial enhancement, and portal enhancement images), and the US + CEUS + CL model (integrating US, arterial enhancement, and portal enhancement images with clinical characteristics). Each model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as the AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision, providing a comprehensive understanding of their predictive efficacy.\n\nThe decision curve analysis further assessed the clinical utility of the models by quantifying the net benefits at different risk thresholds. This analysis helps in understanding the practical value of the models in real-world clinical settings.\n\nWhile the models themselves are not fully transparent, the use of feature significance analysis and correlation assessment provides a level of interpretability. This approach allows for a better understanding of which features are driving the model's predictions and how they interact with each other.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a classification model. It is designed to differentiate between two types of liver cancer: hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). The model utilizes various imaging features extracted from ultrasound (US) and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) images, along with clinical characteristics, to classify the type of liver cancer present in a patient.\n\nThe performance of the model was evaluated using metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision. These metrics indicate that the model is effective in distinguishing between HCC and ICC, with the US + CEUS + CL model achieving the highest AUC values in both the validation and test cohorts.\n\nThe decision curve analysis further supports the clinical utility of the model, showing that it provides a significant benefit in terms of net benefits at different risk thresholds. This suggests that the model can be a valuable tool for clinicians in making diagnostic decisions.\n\nThe model was established using a random forest algorithm, which is well-suited for classification tasks. The features used in the model were selected based on their significance, as calculated using XGBoost, and their relationships, as assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient. This ensures that the model is built on a robust set of features that are relevant to the classification task.\n\nIn summary, the model is a classification model that effectively differentiates between HCC and ICC using US and CEUS images, along with clinical characteristics. It has been validated and shown to provide significant clinical benefits.",

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the developed models involved a comprehensive assessment of their predictive efficacy using several metrics and comparisons. Four distinct models were created: the US model (using ultrasound images), the CEUS model (using arterial enhancement and portal enhancement images), the US + CEUS model (combining ultrasound, arterial enhancement, and portal enhancement images), and the US + CEUS + CL model (integrating ultrasound, arterial enhancement, and portal enhancement images with clinical characteristics).\n\nTo evaluate these models, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted, and key metrics such as the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision were calculated for both training and test cohorts. These metrics provided a robust evaluation of each model's performance in distinguishing between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).\n\nAdditionally, the diagnostic performances of the radiomic models were compared with those of three radiologists who had varying levels of experience in liver contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). The radiologists reviewed the images of all cases and made diagnoses. The DeLong test was used to compare the diagnostic performances, ensuring a statistically sound comparison.\n\nA decision curve analysis was also conducted to assess the clinical utility of the models. This analysis quantified the net benefits at different risk thresholds, providing insights into the practical value of the models in clinical settings.\n\nStatistical analysis was performed using SPSS 22.0, with continuous variables expressed as means \u00b1 standard deviation and categorical variables reported as numbers and percentages. Appropriate statistical tests, such as the \u03c72 test, Student\u2019s t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon test, and Fisher\u2019s exact test, were used to analyze clinical features for statistical differences between the training and test cohorts. The reported statistical significance levels were all two-sided, with P values of less than 0.05 considered statistically significant. Calibration diagnostic accuracy was expressed as the AUC, and the resulting specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated. The DeLong test was used to compare AUC values, ensuring a rigorous evaluation of the models' performance.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we evaluated the predictive efficacy of our radiomics models using several key performance metrics. These metrics were calculated for both the training and test cohorts to ensure a comprehensive assessment of model performance.\n\nThe primary metric reported was the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC), which provides a measure of the model's ability to distinguish between the two classes (HCC and ICC). Alongside the AUC, we also reported sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). These metrics offer a detailed view of the model's performance across different aspects.\n\nSensitivity, also known as the true positive rate, indicates the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified by the model. Specificity, or the true negative rate, measures the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified. Accuracy provides an overall measure of the model's correctness, while PPV and NPV offer insights into the precision of positive and negative predictions, respectively.\n\nThese metrics are widely used in the literature for evaluating the performance of diagnostic models, ensuring that our results are comparable with other studies in the field. The inclusion of these metrics allows for a thorough evaluation of the models' diagnostic capabilities and their potential clinical utility.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we developed and compared four distinct radiomics models to evaluate their performance in differentiating between intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). These models included the US model (using ultrasound images), the CEUS model (using arterial enhancement and portal enhancement images), the US + CEUS model (combining ultrasound, arterial enhancement, and portal enhancement images), and the US + CEUS + CL model (integrating ultrasound, arterial enhancement, portal enhancement images with clinical characteristics).\n\nTo assess the predictive efficacy of each model, we plotted receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calculated key metrics such as the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision for both training and test cohorts. These metrics provided a comprehensive evaluation of each model's performance.\n\nAdditionally, we compared the diagnostic performances of our radiomic models with those of three radiologists who had varying levels of experience in liver contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). The radiologists' diagnostic performances were evaluated using the DeLong test, which allowed us to statistically compare the AUC values of the models and the radiologists.\n\nFurthermore, we conducted a decision curve analysis to assess the clinical utility of the models by quantifying the net benefits at different risk thresholds. This analysis helped us determine the practical value of each model in a clinical setting.\n\nWhile we did not compare our methods to publicly available benchmarks or simpler baselines, our study focused on internal comparisons among different model configurations to identify the most effective approach for differentiating ICC from HCC. The results demonstrated that the US + CEUS + CL model achieved the highest AUC, indicating superior diagnostic performance compared to the other models and experienced radiologists.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our models included a comprehensive assessment of performance metrics, which were accompanied by confidence intervals to provide a measure of their reliability. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was a key metric, and it was reported with 95% confidence intervals for each model across different cohorts. This allowed for a clear understanding of the precision of our AUC estimates.\n\nStatistical significance was a crucial aspect of our evaluation. We employed the DeLong test to compare the AUC values of different models, ensuring that any claimed superiority was backed by robust statistical evidence. This test helped us determine whether the differences in AUC between models were statistically significant, thereby validating the enhanced performance of models that incorporated additional information, such as CEUS and clinical data.\n\nMoreover, we conducted decision curve analysis to assess the clinical utility of our models. This analysis quantified the net benefits at different risk thresholds, providing insights into the practical value of our models in real-world clinical settings. The decision curves demonstrated that models incorporating more information, such as US, CEUS, and clinical characteristics, offered greater benefits compared to simpler models.\n\nIn summary, our evaluation was rigorous and statistically sound, with confidence intervals and significance tests supporting the claims of superior performance for our more comprehensive models. This approach ensures that our findings are reliable and applicable in clinical practice.",
