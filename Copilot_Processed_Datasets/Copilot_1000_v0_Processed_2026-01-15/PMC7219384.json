  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from patients diagnosed with COVID-19 via PCR testing at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center between December 22, 2019, and March 12, 2020. This hospital was the designated facility for COVID-19 treatment in Shanghai, ensuring a comprehensive collection of patient data.\n\nA total of 336 patients were enrolled, comprising 310 non-severe/critical cases and 26 severe/critical cases. The dataset includes a variety of clinical and laboratory features collected within 24 hours of the patients' arrival at the hospital. These features encompassed liver function tests, blood tests, and immunocytochemistry results, among others. Initially, 249 laboratory and clinical records were obtained, but after data cleaning and exclusion of records with insufficient information, 220 features were retained for analysis.\n\nThe demographic information of the patients was also collected, including age, gender, and medical history of conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, coronary diseases, and tuberculosis. The median age of all cases was 50 years, with non-severe patients having a median age of 48 and severe/critical patients having a median age of 65. The dataset also included geographical information, with 74 cases from Wuhan, 4 from Iran, and the remainder from other regions of China.\n\nThe clinical and laboratory features were analyzed to identify those significantly associated with severe/critical cases. Statistical methods such as Student's t-test and Wilcoxon rank test were employed, and features with p-values less than 0.01 in both tests were considered significant. This rigorous approach ensured that the selected features were robust indicators of disease severity.\n\nThe dataset has not been used in previous papers by the community, as this study represents an original contribution to the field. The focus was on identifying initial clinical observations and laboratory features significantly associated with severe/critical cases and developing a predictive model for disease progression.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into two main splits: a training dataset and a testing dataset. The training dataset consisted of 193 samples, which included 15 severe/critical cases and 178 mild cases. The testing dataset comprised 143 samples, with 11 severe/critical cases and 132 mild cases. These splits were used to develop and evaluate a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for predicting severe/critical symptoms in COVID-19 patients. The performance of the model was assessed using the Area Under the Receiving Operating Curve (AUROC) in both the training and testing datasets.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets were split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the predictive model. The training dataset consisted of 15 severe/critical cases and 178 mild cases, while the testing dataset comprised 11 severe/critical cases and 132 mild cases. This split ensured that the training and testing sets were independent, allowing for an unbiased evaluation of the model's predictive capabilities.\n\nTo enforce the independence of the datasets, the samples were divided such that there was no overlap between the training and testing sets. This approach helped in assessing the model's generalizability and performance on unseen data. The distribution of the datasets was designed to reflect the real-world scenario, where the majority of cases are mild, and a smaller proportion are severe or critical. This distribution is consistent with previously published machine learning datasets for similar medical studies, ensuring that the model's performance can be compared and validated against existing research.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data used in this study is not publicly available. The study was conducted using clinical and laboratory data from patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center between December 22, 2019, and March 12, 2020. The data includes demographic information, laboratory features, and clinical indicators collected from the electronic record system of the hospital. The study was approved by the Ethic Committee of Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, and all patients provided informed consent.\n\nThe data was divided into training and testing datasets. The training dataset contained 15 severe/critical cases and 178 mild cases, while the testing dataset consisted of 11 severe/critical cases and 132 mild cases. The samples were treated as initial ones, meaning the clinical and laboratory features were generated from the hospital shortly after the patients were diagnosed and transferred.\n\nThe study emphasizes the importance of machine learning in investigating COVID-19 and aims to identify initial clinical observations or laboratory features significantly associated with severe/critical cases. The data was analyzed using statistical methods such as Fisher\u2019s exact test, student t-test, and Wilcoxon rank test for feature selection, and survival analysis was implemented using the R package \u201csurvival.\u201d\n\nThe performance of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model developed in this study was evaluated using the Area Under the Receiving Operating Curve (AUROC). The model achieved an AUROC of 0.9997 in the training dataset and 0.9757 in the testing dataset, indicating robust and effective prediction of severe/critical patients. The detailed prediction results and the optimized cut-off value used in the model are provided in the study.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in our study is Support Vector Machine (SVM). SVM is a well-established and widely used supervised learning algorithm for classification and regression tasks. It is not a new algorithm; it has been extensively studied and applied in various fields, including bioinformatics and medical research.\n\nThe choice of SVM for our study was driven by its robustness and effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data, which is common in clinical and laboratory observations. SVM works by finding the optimal hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space, making it suitable for binary classification problems like predicting severe/critical COVID-19 cases.\n\nGiven that SVM is a mature and well-understood algorithm, publishing our work in a machine-learning journal was not necessary. Instead, we focused on applying SVM to a specific medical problem, demonstrating its practical utility in predicting severe/critical symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Our study contributes to the medical literature by showcasing the application of SVM in a real-world clinical setting, rather than introducing a new machine-learning algorithm.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model developed in this study does not function as a meta-predictor. It does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it relies on a combination of clinical indicators to predict severe/critical symptoms in COVID-19 patients.\n\nThe model specifically utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The features selected for the model include age, glutathione (GSH), CD3 percentage, and total protein. These features were identified through an exhaustive attack method, which involved combining different sets of features to find the optimal combination.\n\nThe training and testing datasets were carefully divided to ensure independence. The training dataset consisted of 15 severe/critical cases and 178 mild cases, while the testing dataset included 11 severe/critical cases and 132 mild cases. This division helps to validate the model's performance and ensure that it generalizes well to new, unseen data.\n\nThe performance of the model was evaluated using the Area Under the Receiving Operating Curve (AUROC). The AUROC reached 0.9996 in the training dataset and 0.9757 in the testing dataset, indicating strong predictive power. The model's sensitivity and specificity were also assessed, with the sensitivity being 77.5% and the specificity being 78.4% in the validation cohort.\n\nIn summary, the model is robust and effective in predicting severe/critical COVID-19 cases. It does not rely on meta-prediction but rather on a well-defined set of clinical indicators and a proven machine-learning algorithm.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing steps were crucial for the machine-learning algorithm's performance. Initially, clinical and laboratory features were collected from electronic health records and manually curated by expert doctors. These features included demographic information, laboratory results, and clinical indicators.\n\nThe data underwent several preprocessing steps. Missing values were handled by excluding records with insufficient data, such as those with fewer than six records for HBV loading. This ensured that only reliable and complete data were used for analysis.\n\nStatistical tests, including Fisher's exact test, Student's t-test, and the Wilcoxon rank test, were employed to identify features significantly associated with severe/critical cases. Features with p-values less than 0.01 in both tests were retained, resulting in 36 clinical and laboratory features significantly associated with severe/critical symptoms.\n\nFor the machine-learning model, an exhaustive attack method was used to combine features in sets of 2, 3, and 4. This method involved listing all possible combinations of the selected features. The samples were then divided into training and testing datasets. The training dataset consisted of 15 severe/critical cases and 178 mild cases, while the testing dataset included 11 severe/critical cases and 132 mild cases.\n\nThe features were encoded and normalized to ensure compatibility with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. Specifically, the clinical feature values were z-score transformed to standardize the data, which helped in improving the model's performance by ensuring that all features contributed equally to the analysis.\n\nIn summary, the data encoding and preprocessing involved careful selection and transformation of clinical and laboratory features, ensuring that the machine-learning algorithm could effectively distinguish between severe/critical and mild cases.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In the optimization process of our model, we utilized an exhaustive attack method, which involved listing all combinations of features. We specifically combined 2, 3, and 4 features to identify the most effective predictors. Among these combinations, the model that performed best used four parameters: age, glutathione (GSH), CD3 percentage, and total protein. These parameters were selected based on their ability to discriminate between mild and severe/critical cases effectively. The combination of these four features resulted in an area under the receiving operating curve (AUROC) of 0.9997 in the training dataset and 0.9757 in the testing dataset, indicating a robust and effective model for predicting severe/critical symptoms in COVID-19 patients.",
  "optimization/features": "In the optimization process, feature selection was performed using an exhaustive attack method, which involved listing all combinations of features. This method was applied to combinations of 2, 3, and 4 features. The goal was to identify the most effective combinations for predicting severe/critical cases. The selected features were then used to develop a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. The model's performance was evaluated using the Area Under the Receiving Operating Curve (AUROC) in both training and testing datasets. The combination of age, GSH, CD3 percentage, and total protein yielded the highest AUROC, indicating strong predictive power. This combination was subsequently used to develop the final model, which demonstrated robust and effective performance in predicting severe/critical patients.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study involved the use of Support Vector Machine (SVM) models to develop a predictive algorithm for identifying severe/critical COVID-19 cases. The dataset consisted of 336 cases, which were divided into training and testing datasets. The training dataset included 15 severe/critical cases and 178 mild cases, while the testing dataset comprised 11 severe/critical cases and 132 mild cases.\n\nThe number of parameters in the model was not excessively large compared to the number of training points. To mitigate the risk of overfitting, an exhaustive attack method (numeration method) was used, which involved combining different features in sets of 2, 3, and 4. This approach helped in identifying the most effective combinations of features for prediction. The performance of the models was evaluated using the Area Under the Receiving Operating Curve (AUROC), which provided a robust measure of the model's discriminative ability.\n\nTo ensure that the model was not underfitting, various combinations of features were tested. The best-performing combination in the training dataset included age, GSH, CD3 percentage, and total protein, achieving an AUROC of 0.9997. This combination was then validated in the testing dataset, where it achieved an AUROC of 0.9757, indicating strong generalization performance.\n\nAdditionally, the model's performance was further analyzed using survival analysis and Cox multivariate regression. The results showed that the model effectively discriminated between severe/critical and mild cases, with the high-risk group exhibiting a significantly higher severe/critical symptom rate. The features used in the model, particularly the combination of age, GSH, CD3 percentage, and total protein, were found to be informative and contributed to the model's robustness.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed an exhaustive attack method, also known as a numeration method, which involves listing all combinations of features. We specifically combined 2, 3, and 4 features to identify the most effective predictors. This approach inherently helps in preventing overfitting by ensuring that the model is evaluated across multiple feature combinations rather than relying on a single set of features.\n\nAdditionally, we divided our dataset into training and testing sets. The training dataset consisted of 15 severe/critical cases and 178 mild cases, while the testing dataset included 11 severe/critical cases and 132 mild cases. This separation allows the model to be trained on one subset of data and then tested on an independent subset, which helps in assessing the model's generalizability and reducing the risk of overfitting.\n\nWe used Support Vector Machine (SVM) to develop our model. SVM is known for its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces and its ability to handle overfitting through the use of regularization parameters. The performance of our model was evaluated using the Area Under the Receiving Operating Curve (AUROC), which provides a comprehensive measure of the model's ability to discriminate between severe/critical and mild cases.\n\nThe combination of age, GSH, CD3 percentage, and total protein yielded an AUROC of 0.9997 in the training dataset and 0.9757 in the testing dataset. This high performance in both datasets suggests that our model is robust and generalizes well to unseen data, further indicating that overfitting was effectively managed.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in this study is not a blackbox. It is based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, which is inherently interpretable to some extent. The SVM model uses a combination of specific clinical features to make predictions. These features include age, glutathione (GSH), CD3 percentage, and total protein. The model's performance was evaluated using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC), which was 0.9997 in the training dataset and 0.9757 in the testing dataset. This indicates that the model is robust and effective in predicting severe/critical symptoms.\n\nThe interpretability of the model is further supported by the fact that the features used are clinically relevant and have been shown to be associated with disease severity. For example, age is a well-known risk factor for severe outcomes in various diseases, including COVID-19. GSH, CD3 percentage, and total protein are also known to play roles in immune function and overall health, which are crucial in determining the severity of infectious diseases.\n\nAdditionally, the model's performance was analyzed using survival analysis and Cox multivariate regression. The survival analysis showed that the high-risk group, as determined by the model, had a significantly higher severe/critical symptom rate than the low-risk group. The Cox multivariate regression analysis indicated that while some individual features like age were statistically significant, the model's predicted risk value was much more informative. This suggests that the combination of features used in the model provides a more comprehensive and accurate prediction of disease severity.\n\nIn summary, the SVM model developed in this study is interpretable and relies on clinically relevant features. The model's performance and the significance of the features used support its interpretability and usefulness in predicting severe/critical symptoms.",
  "model/output": "The model developed is a classification model. It is designed to predict whether a patient infected with COVID-19 will progress to severe or critical symptoms. The model uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm and is trained on a combination of four clinical indicators: age, GSH, CD3 percentage, and total protein. The performance of the model is evaluated using the Area Under the Receiving Operating Curve (AUROC), which measures the ability of the model to distinguish between severe/critical cases and mild cases. The AUROC values achieved were 0.9996 in the training dataset and 0.9757 in the testing dataset, indicating strong predictive performance. The model classifies patients into high-risk and low-risk groups based on a cutoff value of 0.0667, with the high-risk group showing a significantly higher rate of severe/critical symptoms.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method employed for the developed model involved a comprehensive approach to ensure its robustness and effectiveness. The dataset was divided into training and testing subsets. The training dataset consisted of 15 severe/critical cases and 178 mild cases, while the testing dataset included 11 severe/critical cases and 132 mild cases. This division allowed for a clear separation of data used for model training and subsequent evaluation.\n\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM) was utilized to develop the model using the selected features from the training set. The model's performance was then assessed on the testing set. The primary metric used for evaluation was the Area Under the Receiving Operating Curve (AUROC), which provided a measure of the model's ability to distinguish between severe/critical and mild cases.\n\nThe model demonstrated high performance in both the training and testing datasets, with AUROC values indicating strong predictive capabilities. Specifically, the combination of features such as age, GSH, CD3 ratio, and total protein achieved an AUROC of 0.9997 in the training dataset and 0.9757 in the testing dataset. This high AUROC value suggests that the model is effective in predicting severe/critical cases.\n\nAdditionally, the model's sensitivity and specificity were evaluated. The sensitivity was 77.5%, and the specificity was 78.4% in the validation cohort. These metrics, while not entirely satisfactory due to limited laboratory indicators, provide a baseline for the model's performance.\n\nThe model's robustness was further validated through survival analysis. The samples were divided into low-risk and high-risk groups based on an optimized cut-off value of 0.0667. The high-risk group exhibited a significantly higher severe/critical symptom rate compared to the low-risk group, confirming the model's predictive accuracy.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation method involved a rigorous process of dataset division, model training, and performance assessment using AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity. The results indicate that the SVM model is robust and effective in predicting severe/critical cases, with high AUROC values and a clear distinction between risk groups.",
  "evaluation/measure": "The performance of the developed model was primarily evaluated using the Area Under the Receiving Operating Curve (AUROC). This metric was chosen for its effectiveness in assessing the model's ability to distinguish between severe/critical and mild cases. The AUROC values were reported for both the training and testing datasets, with the training dataset achieving an AUROC of 0.9997 and the testing dataset achieving an AUROC of 0.9757. These high AUROC values indicate that the model has a strong discriminative power.\n\nIn addition to AUROC, the model's performance was further analyzed using sensitivity and specificity. The sensitivity of the model was reported to be 77.5%, and the specificity was 78.4% in the validation cohort. These metrics provide insight into the model's ability to correctly identify severe/critical cases (sensitivity) and to correctly identify mild cases (specificity).\n\nThe recall rate, which is the proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified by the model, was also reported. In the training dataset, the recall rate was 93.33%, and in the testing dataset, it was 100%. This high recall rate in the testing dataset indicates that the model is effective in identifying severe/critical cases.\n\nThe model's performance was also evaluated using survival analysis, which compared the severe/critical symptom rates between high-risk and low-risk groups. The high-risk group, as determined by the model, had a significantly higher severe/critical symptom rate than the low-risk group. This analysis further validates the model's ability to predict the likelihood of severe/critical symptoms.\n\nOverall, the reported performance metrics are comprehensive and representative of the model's effectiveness. The use of AUROC, sensitivity, specificity, and recall rate provides a well-rounded evaluation of the model's performance. Additionally, the survival analysis adds another layer of validation, demonstrating the model's practical application in predicting severe/critical symptoms.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we did not perform a direct comparison with publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. However, we did compare our model's performance with simpler baselines and other related studies.\n\nOur model utilized a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with an optimized combination of four clinical indicators: age, GSH, CD3 ratio, and total protein. This combination demonstrated superior performance in discriminating between mild and severe/critical COVID-19 cases, achieving an Area Under the Receiving Operating Curve (AUROC) of 0.9996 in the training dataset and 0.9757 in the testing dataset.\n\nWe also referenced another study that used multivariate logistic regression for predicting the progression to severe symptoms in COVID-19 patients. That study achieved an AUROC of 0.954, which is lower than the performance of our model. This comparison highlights the effectiveness of our approach in utilizing a larger set of clinical indicators and a robust machine learning model.\n\nAdditionally, we evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of our model, which were 77.5% and 78.4%, respectively, in the validation cohort. While these metrics indicate room for improvement, they provide a baseline for comparing simpler models or different feature sets.\n\nIn summary, although we did not conduct a direct benchmark comparison with other publicly available methods, our model's performance was evaluated against simpler baselines and related studies, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in predicting severe/critical COVID-19 cases.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "Evaluation Confidence\n\nThe performance of the model was evaluated using the Area Under the Receiving Operating Curve (AUROC), which is a robust metric for assessing the discriminative power of a classifier. The AUROC values for the training and testing datasets were reported, indicating the model's performance in both scenarios. The highest AUROC achieved in the training set was approximately 0.9997, and in the testing set, it was around 0.9757. These values suggest that the model has a high ability to distinguish between severe/critical and mild cases.\n\nStatistical significance was assessed using p-values, which were reported for various comparisons. For instance, the p-value for the difference in severe rates between the high-risk and low-risk groups was less than 1e-16, indicating a highly significant difference. Additionally, the features used in the model, such as age, were found to be statistically significant in Cox multivariate regression analysis.\n\nThe model's performance was further validated by comparing it with other studies. For example, another study achieved an AUROC of 0.954, but with a smaller sample size, which raised concerns about the generalizability of their results. In contrast, our model used over 220 clinical indicators and demonstrated better performance, suggesting its robustness and effectiveness.\n\nThe sensitivity and specificity of the model were also reported, with values of 77.5% and 78.4%, respectively, in the validation cohort. While these values indicate room for improvement, they provide a baseline for the model's performance in real-world settings.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics reported for the model are accompanied by statistical significance tests, and the results suggest that the model is superior to other baselines and comparable studies. The high AUROC values, along with the statistically significant p-values, provide confidence in the model's ability to predict severe/critical cases of COVID-19.",
