Specifically, GSE75436 served as the training set, while GSE15629 and GSE122897 were used as validating sets. This ensures that the training data is independent from the validation data, providing a robust evaluation of the model's performance.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The datasets utilized in this study were obtained from the GEO database, including bulk-tissue mRNA sequence data and single-cell RNA sequencing data. The mRNA sequence data consisted of three datasets: GSE75436, GSE15629, and GSE122897, which included samples from human subjects diagnosed with intracranial aneurysms (IA) and control samples. The single-cell RNA sequencing data, dataset GSE193533, comprised samples from a mouse model of IA and sham controls.\n\nFor the construction of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, the STRING website and Cytoscape software were employed. The key genes identified through LASSO regression were set as the core of the PPI network, with a confidence level set to 0.4. This network helped visualize the interactions between IA-Mito DEGs and IA-necroptosis DEGs.\n\nThe gene-microRNA-transcription factor (TF) interaction network was constructed using the online tool NetworkAnalyst.

The expressions of key genes were validated using the datasets GSE15629 and GSE122897. Machine learning algorithms, including the Random Forest (RF) and Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), were employed to evaluate the diagnostic value of these key genes. The number of features used as input varied depending on the dataset and the specific analysis being conducted. For instance, the PPI network construction involved IA-Mito DEGs and IA-necroptosis DEGs, with key genes identified through LASSO regression serving as the core. The exact number of features (f) used as input in the machine learning models is not explicitly stated, but it is implied that the key genes identified through the aforementioned methods were used as input features.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed LASSO regression to identify key genes associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and necroptosis. This method is particularly useful when the number of parameters (genes) is much larger than the number of training points (samples), as it performs both variable selection and regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the statistical model.\n\nTo address the risk of over-fitting, we utilized cross-validation techniques. Specifically, we performed 10-fold cross-validation, which involves partitioning the data into 10 subsets, training the model on 9 subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated 10 times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. By averaging the results, we obtained a more reliable estimate of the model's performance and ensured that it generalizes well to unseen data.\n\nTo mitigate under-fitting, we carefully selected the regularization parameter (lambda) in the LASSO regression. This parameter controls the strength of the penalty applied to the absolute values of the regression coefficients. By tuning lambda through cross-validation, we balanced the trade-off between bias and variance, ensuring that the model is neither too simple (under-fitting) nor too complex (over-fitting).\n\nAdditionally, we validated the key genes identified through LASSO regression using independent datasets (GSE15629 and GSE122897). The Wilcoxon test was employed to assess the expression differences between IA and control samples, further confirming the robustness of our findings. Machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest (RF) and Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), were also used to evaluate the diagnostic value of the key genes, providing additional evidence of their relevance and reliability.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression as a regularization method to prevent overfitting. This technique is particularly useful for handling high-dimensional data by performing both variable selection and regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the statistical model it produces. By setting key genes screened from LASSO regression as the core of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, we ensured that our analysis focused on the most relevant genes, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting. This approach helped us to identify significant interactions and upstream regulations more reliably.",
  "optimization/config": "Not applicable.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a blackbox. It incorporates several transparent and interpretable components that allow for a clear understanding of the underlying processes.\n\nOne of the key transparent aspects is the construction of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. These networks visualize the interactions between differentially expressed genes related to mitochondrial dysfunction and necroptosis in intracranial aneurysms (IA). By using tools like the STRING website and Cytoscape software, the interactions among these genes are made explicit, providing a clear map of how these genes might be influencing each other.\n\nAdditionally, the study uses LASSO regression to screen for key genes, which are then set as the core of the PPI network. This method not only identifies important genes but also provides a transparent way to understand their significance within the network.\n\nThe gene-microRNA-transcription factor (TF) interaction network further enhances the interpretability. By using the NetworkAnalyst tool, the study predicts the upstream regulation of key genes, identifying common transcription factors and microRNAs that target these genes. For instance, transcription factors like JUN, TP53, and FOS are shown to target multiple key genes, providing a clear picture of the regulatory mechanisms at play.\n\nMoreover, the validation of key genes through datasets like GSE15629 and GSE122897 involves statistical methods such as the Wilcoxon test, which clearly show the expression differences between IA and control samples. This transparency allows for a straightforward interpretation of how these genes are differentially expressed in the context of IA.\n\nThe use of machine learning algorithms, such as the Random Forest (RF) and Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithms, also contributes to the interpretability. These algorithms evaluate the diagnostic value of key genes, and their performance metrics, such as precision and F-measure, are clearly reported. This provides a transparent way to assess the model's effectiveness in diagnosing IA.\n\nIn summary, the model is designed to be transparent, with clear visualizations and statistical methods that make the underlying processes and findings easily interpretable. This transparency is crucial for understanding the biological significance of the results and for validating the model's predictions.",

The expressions of key genes were validated using the Wilcoxon test, and their diagnostic value was evaluated through machine learning algorithms. The results showed significant expression disparities between IA and control samples, with varying predictive capabilities across different datasets.\n\nIn summary, the model used in this study is a classification model that leverages machine learning algorithms to assess the diagnostic value of key genes associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and necroptosis in intracranial aneurysms.

  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our study, we focused on several key performance metrics to assess the diagnostic value of the identified key genes for intracranial aneurysms (IA). Specifically, we reported the precision and F-measure of our predictions across different datasets. Precision indicates the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions, while the F-measure provides a harmonic mean of precision and recall, offering a balanced view of the model's performance.\n\nWe evaluated these metrics on three datasets: GSE15629, GSE75436, and GSE122897. The precision values were 0.774, 0.902, and 0.811, respectively, and the F-measures were 0.770, 0.900, and 0.798. These metrics are crucial for understanding the reliability and accuracy of our gene-based diagnostic approach.\n\nAdditionally, we performed statistical validation using machine learning techniques. The p-values from these analyses indicated significant diagnostic value in GSE75436 and GSE122897 (P < 0.05), but not in GSE15629 (P > 0.05). The lesser performance in GSE15629 may be attributed to the smaller sample size in this dataset, which can affect the robustness of the statistical tests.\n\nThe choice of these metrics is representative of common practices in the field of bioinformatics and genomics. Precision and F-measure are widely used to evaluate the performance of predictive models, especially in scenarios involving imbalanced datasets.

For example, we used the Wilcoxon test to calculate and visualize the expression differences between IA and control samples. This test is a non-parametric alternative to the t-test and is suitable for comparing two related samples, making it a simpler yet effective baseline method. Furthermore, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of our data and identify patterns. PCA is a fundamental technique in data analysis that helps in visualizing high-dimensional data.\n\nIn summary, while we did not conduct a head-to-head comparison with other publicly available methods on benchmark datasets, we leveraged a combination of sophisticated and simpler baseline methods to ensure the reliability and validity of our findings.",
