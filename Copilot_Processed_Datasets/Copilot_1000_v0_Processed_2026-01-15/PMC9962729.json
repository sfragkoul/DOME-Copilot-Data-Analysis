  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from several public databases. The mRNA expression profiles and clinical information of 374 ovarian cancer (OC) patients were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Additionally, 88 normal ovarian tissue mRNA expression samples were downloaded from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database. For external validation, data were obtained from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) database, specifically from the Australian OC patient cohort OV-AU, and from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, using the datasets GSE13876 and GSE49997. These datasets were chosen for their comprehensive and publicly available data, which allowed for robust analysis and validation of the findings. The data from these sources were normalized and merged for further comparison using appropriate R packages. The use of multiple databases ensured the reliability and generalizability of the results.",
  "dataset/splits": "In our study, we utilized data from multiple databases to ensure robust and validated results. We primarily used three main datasets for our analysis: the TCGA, ICGC, and GEO databases.\n\nThe TCGA dataset served as our training cohort, consisting of 374 ovarian cancer (OC) samples. This dataset was used to identify differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes and to construct a prognostic signature.\n\nFor external validation, we used two additional datasets:\n\n1. The ICGC dataset, specifically the Australian OC patient cohort OV-AU, which included 69 patients. These patients were divided into high-risk and low-risk groups based on the risk score formula derived from the TCGA dataset.\n\n2. The GEO dataset, which comprised two datasets: GSE13876 and GSE49997. Together, these datasets included 387 samples, which were also divided into high-risk and low-risk groups using the same risk score formula.\n\nThe distribution of data points in each dataset was as follows:\n\n- TCGA cohort: 374 OC samples.\n- ICGC cohort: 69 samples, divided into 34 high-risk and 35 low-risk samples.\n- GEO cohort: 387 samples, divided into 211 high-risk and 176 low-risk samples.\n\nThese datasets were used to validate the prognostic value of the five-gene model constructed in the TCGA database, ensuring that the model was robust and generalizable across different patient populations.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "Not enough information is available.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data utilized in this study were obtained from several publicly available databases. The normal ovarian tissue mRNA expression samples were downloaded from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database. External validation data were sourced from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) database and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The ICGC data used were from the Australian ovarian cancer patient cohort OV-AU, and the GEO datasets included GSE13876 and GSE49997. Additionally, 382 ferroptosis-related genes were downloaded from FerrDb.\n\nThe datasets were accessed on December 17, 2021, and strict guidelines were followed according to the policies of these databases. The gene expression profiles were normalized using the scale method provided in the \"limma\" R package (v3.54.0). The data from these databases were combined and analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes and prognostic ferroptosis-related genes. The specific datasets and their access points are clearly mentioned, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.\n\nThe data splits used in the study were enforced by dividing the patients into high-risk and low-risk groups based on the risk score formula derived from the analysis. This division was consistently applied across different cohorts, including the TCGA, ICGC, and GEO databases, to validate the prognostic value of the gene signature. The Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves, PCA plots, t-SNE analyses, and ROC curves were used to demonstrate the predictive efficiency and accuracy of the risk score model in these cohorts.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm used in this study is the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression, which is a type of linear regression that includes both variable selection and regularization. This method is well-established and commonly used in bioinformatics for constructing prognostic models due to its ability to enhance prediction accuracy and interpretability.\n\nLASSO regression is not a new machine-learning algorithm. It has been extensively used in various fields, including genomics, to identify key variables that contribute to a particular outcome. The reason it was not published in a machine-learning journal is that this study focuses on its application in the context of ovarian cancer prognosis rather than the development of the algorithm itself. The algorithm's effectiveness in identifying prognostic signatures for ovarian cancer is the primary focus, leveraging its established capabilities to provide insights into ferroptosis-related genes and their impact on patient outcomes.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model described in this publication does not function as a meta-predictor. It does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it relies on a five-gene signature derived from ferroptosis-related genes to predict the prognosis of ovarian cancer patients.\n\nThe construction of the prognostic model involved several steps, including data collection from public databases such as TCGA, ICGC, and GEO. The model was validated across multiple cohorts to ensure its robustness and predictive accuracy. Various statistical methods, including univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, were employed to assess the independent prognostic value of the risk score derived from the five-gene signature.\n\nThe model's performance was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, principal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. These analyses demonstrated that the five-gene prognostic signature could effectively stratify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups, with significant differences in overall survival.\n\nIn summary, the model is a standalone prognostic tool that does not integrate predictions from other machine-learning algorithms. It leverages gene expression data and statistical analyses to provide a reliable prognostic signature for ovarian cancer.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure the integrity and comparability of the datasets used. Initially, mRNA expression profiles and clinical information were obtained from multiple databases, including the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). These datasets were normalized using the \"limma\" R package to remove batch-specific effects and ensure consistency across different sources.\n\nThe gene expression profiles were specifically normalized using the \"NormalizeBetweenArrays\" function within the \"limma\" package. This step was crucial for combining data from normal ovarian tissues and ovarian cancer (OC) samples, allowing for a fair comparison. The normalization process helped to mitigate any technical variations that could arise from different experimental conditions or platforms.\n\nAdditionally, the gene expression data were filtered to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to ferroptosis. The criteria for identifying DEGs included a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.05 and an absolute log2 fold change (|log2 FC|) of at least 1. This stringent filtering ensured that only genes with significant and biologically relevant changes in expression were considered for further analysis.\n\nClinical data from the TCGA database were combined with the gene expression data using the \"bioconductor\" R package. This integration allowed for the association of gene expression profiles with survival information, which was essential for conducting univariate Cox analyses to identify prognostic ferroptosis-related genes.\n\nOverall, the data encoding and preprocessing steps were meticulously designed to ensure the reliability and robustness of the subsequent machine-learning analyses. These steps included normalization, filtering of DEGs, and integration of clinical data, all of which were performed using established bioinformatics tools and packages.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In the optimization process, the number of parameters (p) used in the model was determined through a systematic approach involving LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression. This method is particularly useful for variable selection and regularization, enhancing both the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the model.\n\nInitially, a comprehensive set of ferroptosis-related genes was considered. Through univariate Cox analysis, genes significantly associated with overall survival were identified. Subsequently, LASSO regression was employed to further refine this set by selecting an optimal subset of genes. The LASSO regression process involved determining the optimal penalty parameter (\u03bb), which controls the degree of regularization. This parameter was chosen to minimize the prediction error and ensure the model's robustness.\n\nAs a result of this process, a five-gene signature was constructed. These five genes were selected based on their consistent expression and hazard ratios in both normal and tumor tissues, as well as their prognostic significance. The final model incorporated these five genes, each with a specific coefficient, to calculate the risk score for patients. This approach ensured that the model was both parsimonious and effective in predicting outcomes.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized a set of 382 ferroptosis-related genes as input features. These genes were categorized into three groups: drivers, suppressors, and markers. To identify the most relevant genes for our prognostic model, we performed feature selection using the training set only. This process involved analyzing differentially expressed genes and their prognostic value. Specifically, we conducted a univariate Cox analysis to assess the overall survival associated with each gene. Additionally, we employed the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to further refine the selection of genes, ensuring that the final model included only the most significant predictors. This approach enhanced the prediction accuracy and interpretability of our prognostic signature.",
  "optimization/fitting": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression as a regularization method to prevent overfitting. LASSO is particularly useful for high-dimensional data, as it performs both variable selection and regularization. This technique enhances the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the model by shrinking some coefficient estimates to zero, effectively selecting a subset of the most relevant features.\n\nWe utilized LASSO regression during the construction of our prognostic signature. This involved identifying an optimal penalty parameter \u03bb, which determined the coefficients of each gene in the risk score formula. By doing so, we ensured that our model was robust and generalizable, reducing the risk of overfitting to the training data. This approach allowed us to construct a reliable prognostic model that could effectively stratify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups based on their gene expression profiles.",
  "optimization/config": "Not applicable.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model constructed in this study is not a black box but rather a transparent prognostic signature. The model is based on a clear and interpretable formula that combines the expression levels of five specific genes to calculate a risk score for each patient. The formula is as follows:\n\nRisk score = (0.2686 * expression level of ALOX12) + (0.1413 * expression level of STEAP3) + (0.1787 * expression level of RB1) \u2212 (0.2613 * expression level of DNAJB6) \u2212 (0.2126 * expression level of SELENOS).\n\nEach term in the formula represents the product of a gene's expression level and its corresponding coefficient, which indicates the gene's contribution to the risk score. For instance, ALOX12 has a positive coefficient, suggesting that higher expression levels of this gene are associated with a higher risk score. In contrast, DNAJB6 and SELENOS have negative coefficients, implying that higher expression levels of these genes are linked to a lower risk score.\n\nThe coefficients were determined using LASSO Cox regression, a statistical method that performs both variable selection and regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the model. The optimal value of the penalty parameter \u03bb was selected to determine the coefficients of each gene in the risk score formula.\n\nMoreover, the model's transparency is further supported by the use of univariate and multivariate Cox analyses, which identified the five genes with consistent expression and hazard ratios in both normal and tumor tissues. This ensures that the selected genes are biologically relevant and have a significant impact on patient prognosis.\n\nIn summary, the model's transparency allows for a clear understanding of how the risk score is calculated and which genes contribute to the prognosis of ovarian cancer patients. This interpretability is crucial for clinical decision-making and the development of targeted therapies.",
  "model/output": "The model developed is a regression model, specifically a prognostic signature constructed using LASSO Cox regression and multivariate Cox analyses. This model is designed to predict the overall survival (OS) of ovarian cancer patients based on the expression levels of five specific genes. The risk score formula derived from the model is used to stratify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups, with the high-risk group exhibiting poorer survival rates. The model's predictive efficiency was validated across multiple datasets, including TCGA, ICGC, and GEO cohorts, demonstrating its robustness and clinical relevance. The risk score is calculated using the expression levels of five genes: ALOX12, STEAP3, RB1, DNAJB6, and SELENOS, each with assigned coefficients that contribute to the final risk score. This regression model provides a quantitative measure of risk, allowing for the assessment of prognosis and potential clinical decision-making.",

  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the prognostic signature involved several steps and datasets to ensure its robustness and clinical relevance. Initially, the signature was constructed using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort. The risk scores were calculated for each patient, and they were subsequently divided into high-risk and low-risk groups. The overall survival (OS) times were then compared between these two subgroups.\n\nTo validate the prognostic value of the five-gene model, independent datasets from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were utilized. In the ICGC dataset, 69 patients were separated into high-risk and low-risk groups based on the risk score formula. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) analyses demonstrated that the risk score model effectively distinguished between the two groups. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that patients in the high-risk group had worse overall survival rates compared to those in the low-risk group. The time-dependent Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve further confirmed the predictive efficiency and accuracy of the risk score model, with Area Under the Curve (AUC) values of 0.659 at 3 years and 0.650 at 5 years.\n\nSimilarly, the GEO datasets were used to assess the prognostic value of the signature. The samples were divided into high-risk and low-risk groups, and PCA and t-SNE analyses again showed effective separation. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated a statistical difference in survival probability between the two groups. The ROC curve analysis yielded AUC values of 0.701 at 1 year, 0.673 at 2 years, and 0.592 at 3 years, demonstrating consistent and valid prognostic value across different datasets.\n\nAdditionally, univariate and multivariate independent prognostic analyses were conducted using the TCGA, ICGC, and GEO databases. These analyses, processed using the \"survival\" R package, revealed that the risk score was significantly related to overall survival time. The hazard ratios (HR) and confidence intervals (CI) further supported the independent prognostic value of the five-gene signature.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation method involved constructing the prognostic signature in the TCGA cohort and validating it in independent ICGC and GEO datasets. The use of survival analysis, PCA, t-SNE, and ROC curves provided comprehensive evidence of the signature's predictive efficiency and clinical relevance.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our prognostic signature, we employed several performance metrics to assess its predictive efficiency and validity. The primary metrics reported include the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, which provides a measure of the model's ability to discriminate between high-risk and low-risk patients. For the TCGA cohort, the ROC curve demonstrated the predictive efficiency of the five-gene prognostic signature. Similarly, in the ICGC cohort, the AUC of the ROC curve reached 0.659 at 3 years and 0.650 at 5 years, indicating a robust predictive performance. For the GEO datasets, the AUC values were 0.701 at 1 year, 0.673 at 2 years, and 0.592 at 3 years, further validating the model's consistency and accuracy.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves to compare the overall survival (OS) times between high-risk and low-risk groups across different cohorts. These curves consistently showed that patients in the high-risk group had worse OS rates than those in the low-risk group, reinforcing the prognostic value of our signature.\n\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) analyses were also conducted to visualize the separation of patients into distinct risk groups based on the five-gene signature. These analyses confirmed that the risk score model effectively differentiated between high-risk and low-risk patients in both the ICGC and GEO cohorts.\n\nThe set of metrics used is representative of standard practices in the literature for evaluating prognostic models in cancer research. The combination of ROC curves, Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis, and dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and t-SNE provides a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance, ensuring that it is both valid and clinically relevant.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "Evaluation Confidence\n\nThe evaluation of the prognostic signature's performance includes several statistical analyses that provide confidence in the results. The Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are used to assess the predictive efficiency of the five-gene prognostic signature. The ROC curves demonstrate the predictive efficiency with area under the curve (AUC) values, which are provided for different time points, such as 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years. These AUC values give a quantitative measure of the model's performance and its confidence intervals can be calculated to understand the variability and reliability of these estimates.\n\nStatistical significance is indicated with asterisks, where a two-sided p-value of less than 0.05 is considered significant. This threshold ensures that the observed differences in survival between high-risk and low-risk groups are unlikely to be due to chance. The univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses further support the independent prognostic value of the risk score, with hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) provided for each database (TCGA, ICGC, and GEO). These analyses show that the risk score is significantly related to overall survival time, reinforcing the confidence in the model's predictive power.\n\nAdditionally, the use of principal component analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analyses helps visualize the separation of patients into high-risk and low-risk groups based on the five-gene signature. These visualizations, along with the survival status plots, provide qualitative evidence that the risk score model effectively stratifies patients according to their survival outcomes. The consistent results across multiple datasets (TCGA, ICGC, and GEO) further enhance the confidence in the robustness and generalizability of the prognostic signature.",
