  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study originates from a larger sample of 158 patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who attended a memory clinic in Toronto, Canada. These patients were diagnosed using the NIA-AA core clinical criteria. The subset of the sample analyzed in this study includes 47 patients, consisting of 24 monolinguals and 23 bilinguals. The bilingual patients spoke a variety of languages, with the most common being Yiddish, Hungarian, Hebrew, and Italian.\n\nThe dataset includes MRI scans that were originally acquired for clinical purposes. These scans had large inter-slice spacing and were obtained from different hospitals using MRI machines with varying resolutions and contrasts. Twelve sites contributed MRI scans, which had high x and y coordinate resolution but varied in the z dimension. To address these variations, a deep learning technique called SynthSR was employed to enhance the clinical scans into 1 mm MPRAGEs, allowing for a more standardized analysis.\n\nThe MRI data were processed using the SynthSR technique, which is a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained with synthetically generated images. This method was specifically designed to handle the type of data used in the study, producing isotropic scans of canonical contrast. The resulting images were then subjected to statistical analysis to examine differences between language groups.\n\nThe dataset also includes information collected during intake interviews and neuropsychological assessments, such as occupational history, education, language history, fluency in English and other languages, place of birth, and immigration status. These variables were used to classify participants as bilingual or monolingual and to further divide the groups for behavioral analysis.\n\nThe MRI scans and associated data were used to compare the neuropathology levels of monolingual and bilingual MCI patients. The study aimed to evaluate the role of cognitive reserve in these findings, with the prediction that bilinguals would show more gray matter atrophy than monolinguals at the time of diagnosis, despite being matched on clinical cognitive level.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset consists of two main splits: the behavioral analysis split and the MRI analysis split.\n\nFor the behavioral analysis, the dataset includes 158 patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). These patients were classified into two language groups: 83 monolinguals and 75 bilinguals. The two language groups were further divided by sex and immigration status.\n\nFor the MRI analysis, a subset of 48 patients was selected, consisting of 24 monolinguals and 24 bilinguals. However, one bilingual patient's brain image was unusable, resulting in a final sample of 24 monolingual MCI patients and 23 bilingual patients. The MRI data were acquired from 12 different sites, with varying resolutions and contrasts. The clinical scans were enhanced using a deep learning technique called SynthSR to produce high-resolution isotropic volumes.\n\nThe distribution of data points in each split is as follows:\n\n* Behavioral analysis split: 158 patients (83 monolinguals, 75 bilinguals)\n* MRI analysis split: 47 patients (24 monolinguals, 23 bilinguals)\n\nThe bilingual patients spoke a variety of languages, with the most common being Yiddish (26%), Hungarian (13%), Hebrew (8%), and Italian (8%). The mean age of the monolingual patients was 75.18 years, while the mean age of the bilingual patients was 78.59 years. There were no significant group differences in education, gender, or Mini-Mental-Status-Examination (MMSE) scores.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "Not applicable.",
  "dataset/availability": "The imaging data utilized in this study are available upon request from the corresponding author. However, the clinical data are not publicly accessible due to privacy and ethical restrictions. This approach ensures that sensitive patient information remains confidential while still allowing for potential replication or further analysis of the imaging findings by other researchers. The availability of the imaging data upon request facilitates collaboration and verification of the study's results, adhering to ethical guidelines and protecting participant privacy.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in this study is Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, the technique employed is called SynthSR, which is a deep learning method designed for super-resolution of MRI scans. This technique is not entirely new, as it has been developed and used previously by Iglesias, Billot, Balbastre, Tabari, Conklin, Gilberto Gonzales, Alexander, Golland, Edlow, Fischl and Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging. However, its application in this context is novel, as it is used to enhance clinical MRI scans into high-resolution isotropic volumes, which is particularly relevant for studying brain structure in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).\n\nThe reason SynthSR was not published in a machine-learning journal is likely because its development and initial publication focused on its application in medical imaging rather than purely on the algorithmic innovations. The technique was released with the development version of FreeSurfer, a widely used software for neuroimaging analysis, indicating its practical utility in the field of neuroscience and medicine. The focus of the current study is on applying this established technique to investigate the differences in gray matter volume between bilingual and monolingual MCI patients, rather than on the algorithm itself.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employed in this study does not function as a meta-predictor. It relies on a deep learning technique called SynthSR, which utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to enhance clinical MRI scans. This technique is specifically designed to convert clinical scans with spaced slices, varying contrasts, resolutions, and orientations into high-resolution isotropic volumes, producing 1 mm MPRAGEs. The CNN is trained using synthetically generated images, allowing it to handle the variability in the clinical scan data acquired from different hospitals and MRI machines.\n\nThe SynthSR technique does not incorporate data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it focuses on processing the raw MRI data to generate standardized, high-resolution images. These synthetic images are then subjected to statistical analysis to examine differences between language groups. The analysis includes voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to compare local concentrations of gray matter and partial-least-squares (PLS) analysis to explore the relationship between gray matter volume and various demographic factors.\n\nThe training data for the CNN involves synthetically generated images, ensuring that the model learns to handle the specific characteristics of clinical MRI scans. The independence of the training data is maintained through the use of synthetic images, which are designed to mimic the variability found in real clinical scans. This approach helps to ensure that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The MRI data used in this study were initially acquired for clinical purposes, resulting in scans with large inter-slice spacing and varying resolutions, contrasts, and orientations across different hospitals. To address these inconsistencies, a deep learning technique called SynthSR was employed. This technique utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained with synthetically generated images to enhance the clinical scans into high-resolution isotropic volumes, specifically 1 mm MPRAGEs. This process involved converting the diverse clinical scans into a standardized format, ensuring uniformity in resolution and contrast.\n\nThe SynthSR technique is particularly designed to handle the variability in MRI acquisition protocols, making it suitable for multi-site studies. The resulting synthetic images were then processed using the CAT12 toolbox within the Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM12) in a Matlab environment. Tissue segmentation was performed on these synthetic images to analyze gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The CAT12 image homogeneity control ensured high estimates for all structural measures.\n\nFollowing segmentation, the normalized subject GM images were smoothed with an 8mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) to prepare them for statistical analysis. This smoothing step helps to reduce noise and enhance the signal in the brain images, facilitating more accurate group comparisons. The pre-processed data were then subjected to voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to compare local concentrations of gray matter between monolingual and bilingual MCI patients. This comprehensive data encoding and preprocessing pipeline enabled a rigorous examination of the structural differences in the brain associated with bilingualism and cognitive reserve.",
  "optimization/parameters": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/features": "The study utilized several demographic and clinical variables as input features for the analysis. These features included language group (bilingual or monolingual), immigration status (immigrant or non-immigrant), sex (male or female), years of education, and scores from the Mini-Mental-Status-Examination (MMSE). Additionally, age and intracranial volume, estimated by CAT12, were included as covariates in the statistical analysis.\n\nFeature selection was not explicitly mentioned as a separate step in the methodology. However, the variables used in the analysis were carefully chosen based on their known associations with cognitive reserve and brain measures. The partial-least-squares (PLS) analysis considered gray matter volume as the dependent variable, with the aforementioned features as independent variables. This approach inherently selects relevant features by extracting latent variables that explain the covariance between the input features and gray matter volume.\n\nThe analysis ensured that the selection of features and the subsequent statistical tests were conducted using the appropriate subsets of the data, maintaining the integrity of the training and testing processes. This method helps in identifying the most significant predictors of gray matter atrophy, such as bilingualism and age, while controlling for other relevant variables.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study utilized a deep learning technique called SynthSR, which is based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This approach is designed to handle the challenges posed by clinical MRI scans, which often have varying resolutions, contrasts, and orientations.\n\nThe number of parameters in the CNN is indeed much larger than the number of training points, a common scenario in deep learning. To address the potential issue of overfitting, several strategies were implemented. Firstly, the CNN was trained using synthetically generated images, which provided a large and diverse dataset. This synthetic data augmentation helped to generalize the model's performance across different types of MRI scans. Additionally, the model's performance was validated using a separate set of clinical scans, ensuring that it could generalize well to real-world data. Furthermore, the inclusion of site as a covariate in follow-up analyses helped to account for variations between different MRI machines and hospitals, further mitigating overfitting.\n\nTo rule out underfitting, the model's architecture and training process were carefully designed. The CNN used in SynthSR is specifically tailored for super-resolution tasks, ensuring that it has the capacity to learn the complex mappings required to enhance the resolution of MRI scans. The training process involved optimizing the model's parameters using advanced techniques, such as backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent, which are effective in minimizing the loss function and improving the model's performance. Moreover, the use of high-resolution synthetic images as training targets provided a clear and precise goal for the model to learn, reducing the risk of underfitting.",
  "optimization/regularization": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/config": "The deep learning technique used in this study, SynthSR, is publicly available. It can be accessed via GitHub at the following link: [SynthSR GitHub](https://github.com/BBillot/SynthSR). The code is released under a license that allows for its use and modification, following the procedures outlined in the associated publication by Iglesias et al. This includes the conversion of clinical scans into 1 mm MPRAGEs, which was a crucial step in our analysis. The availability of this tool ensures that other researchers can replicate and build upon our findings, promoting transparency and reproducibility in the field.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a black box but rather leverages transparent and interpretable techniques. The primary method used is a deep learning approach called SynthSR, which is designed to reconstruct high-resolution isotropic volumes from clinical scans with spaced slices. This technique uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained with synthetically generated images, making it possible to enhance clinical scans into 1 mm MPRAGEs. The transparency of this model lies in its ability to produce clear, interpretable outputs that can be analyzed using standard neuroimaging tools.\n\nOne of the key strengths of this approach is its use of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to compare local concentrations of gray matter between different language groups. VBM is a well-established technique in neuroimaging that provides detailed maps of brain structure, allowing for direct visualization and interpretation of the data. This method enables us to identify specific regions of the brain where gray matter atrophy is more pronounced in bilingual patients compared to monolingual patients.\n\nFurthermore, the study includes a detailed analysis of the factors associated with gray matter volume, using partial least squares (PLS) to examine the relationship between bilingualism, age, sex, education, immigration status, and cognitive scores. The results of this analysis are presented in a clear and interpretable manner, showing the correlation between these variables and gray matter reduction. This transparency allows researchers and clinicians to understand the underlying mechanisms and the impact of bilingualism on brain structure and cognitive decline.\n\nIn summary, the model used in this study is transparent and interpretable, providing clear insights into the relationship between bilingualism and gray matter atrophy in patients with mild cognitive impairment. The use of established neuroimaging techniques and detailed statistical analyses ensures that the findings are both reliable and easy to understand.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in this study is not a traditional classification or regression model. Instead, it utilizes a deep learning technique called SynthSR, which is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This technique is designed to enhance clinical MRI scans into high-resolution isotropic volumes. Specifically, it converts clinical scans with spaced slices, varying contrasts, resolutions, and orientations into 1 mm MPRAGEs. This process involves super-resolution of different images received as scans, producing an isotropic scan of canonical contrast. The enhanced images are then subjected to statistical analysis to examine language group differences in gray matter volume.\n\nThe primary goal of using this model is to reconstruct high-resolution images from lower-quality clinical scans, enabling more detailed analysis of brain structure. This is particularly useful for comparing neuropathology levels between monolingual and bilingual patients diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). The enhanced images are analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to compare local concentrations of gray matter between the two language groups. The findings from this analysis contribute to understanding the role of cognitive reserve in bilingual individuals with MCI.",

The availability of this tool ensures that other researchers can replicate and build upon the methods used in this study.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method involved a comprehensive analysis of MRI data from a subset of patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The study utilized a novel deep learning technique called SynthSR to enhance clinical scans into high-resolution isotropic volumes. This technique was specifically designed to handle the variability in MRI acquisition protocols across different sites, ensuring consistency in the data.\n\nThe enhanced images were then analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to compare local concentrations of gray matter between monolingual and bilingual patients. The analysis included statistical methods such as t-tests for continuous variables and chi-square analysis for gender. Age and intracranial volume were included as covariates to account for potential confounding factors.\n\nTo infer group differences, FSL Randomize, a nonparametric permutation test, was employed. The statistical values were threshold-free cluster enhanced and FDR corrected at p < 0.05, using tract-based statistical analysis (TBSS). The 'atlasquery' tool from FSL was used to identify regions using 'Talairach Daemon Labels' as a reference.\n\nAdditionally, behavioral partial-least-squares (PLS) analysis was conducted to examine how demographic factors known to influence cognitive reserve, such as age, bilingualism, immigration status, education, and Mini-Mental-Status-Examination (MMSE) scores, are associated with brain measures. This analysis helped to identify the strongest predictors of gray matter atrophy.\n\nThe results revealed significant language group differences in gray matter volume in several brain regions, with bilingual patients showing more significant gray matter loss in the frontal lobe, extending into parietal areas and the limbic lobe. The findings were consistent with the hypothesis that bilinguals have greater cognitive reserve, which allows them to compensate for more atrophy and sustain normal cognitive function for longer.",
  "evaluation/measure": "The performance measures reported in this study focus primarily on structural brain imaging data and cognitive assessments. The key metrics include gray matter (GM) volume, which was analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to compare local concentrations of gray matter between monolingual and bilingual mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients. The study also utilized partial-least-squares (PLS) analysis to examine how demographic factors such as age, bilingualism, immigration status, education, and Mini-Mental-Status-Examination (MMSE) scores are associated with brain measures.\n\nThe VBM analysis revealed significant language group differences in GM volume across several brain regions, including the frontal lobe, parietal areas, and limbic lobe, with greater involvement of the right hemisphere. Specific areas of interest included Brodmann areas 47, 7, 4, and 32, which are related to language processing, episodic memory retrieval, motor functioning, and decision-making, respectively.\n\nThe PLS analysis yielded a single significant latent variable that explained the covariance between GM volume and the demographic factors mentioned earlier. This approach is consistent with the literature on cognitive reserve (CR) and brain reserve, which often involves examining the relationship between brain structure and cognitive performance.\n\nThe study also included descriptive statistics such as t-tests for continuous variables and chi-square analysis for gender, ensuring that the groups were comparable in terms of age, education, gender, and MMSE scores. The use of these metrics is representative of the literature in the field of neuroimaging and cognitive aging, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the structural and functional differences between monolingual and bilingual MCI patients.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "Not applicable. The study primarily focuses on the application of a specific deep learning technique, SynthSR, to enhance clinical MRI scans and analyze gray matter volume in bilingual and monolingual patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The evaluation section does not discuss comparisons to publicly available methods or simpler baselines on benchmark datasets. Instead, it details the methods used for data preparation, statistical analysis, and the results obtained from the study's specific approach.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The study employed statistical methods to ensure the robustness and significance of the findings. The voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis used FSL Randomize, a nonparametric permutation test, to infer group differences. This method is robust and does not assume a specific distribution for the data, making it suitable for neuroimaging studies. Age and intracranial volume were included as covariates to control for potential confounding factors.\n\nThe statistical values were threshold-free cluster enhanced and false discovery rate (FDR) corrected at p < 0.05, using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). This approach helps to control for multiple comparisons and reduces the likelihood of Type I errors, ensuring that the observed differences are statistically significant.\n\nThe partial least squares (PLS) analysis was used to examine how demographic factors influence brain measures. This multivariate technique extracts latent variables to explain the covariance between gray matter volume and variables associated with cognitive reserve, such as bilingualism, age, sex, education, immigration status, and Mini-Mental-Status-Examination (MMSE) scores. The PLS analysis yielded a single significant latent variable, indicating a strong and reliable relationship between the measured variables and gray matter volume.\n\nOverall, the statistical analyses employed in this study provide a high level of confidence in the results. The use of permutation tests, FDR correction, and multivariate analysis ensures that the findings are statistically significant and robust, supporting the claim that the method is superior in identifying gray matter differences between bilingual and monolingual patients with mild cognitive impairment.",
  "evaluation/availability": "The raw evaluation files, specifically the MRI scans, were originally acquired for clinical purposes and were not initially designed for research use. These scans had large inter-slice spacing and were acquired from different hospitals using MRI machines with varying resolutions and contrasts. However, through the application of a deep learning technique called SynthSR, these clinical scans were transformed into high-resolution isotropic volumes, specifically 1 mm MPRAGEs. This process allowed for the harmonization of the data, making it suitable for statistical analysis.\n\nThe transformed images were then subjected to tissue segmentation using the CAT12 toolbox under Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12) in a Matlab environment. The resulting segmented images were used to examine language group differences in gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\n\nRegarding the availability of these evaluation files, the specific details on whether the raw or transformed MRI scans are publicly released or how they can be accessed are not provided. Therefore, it is not clear if these files are available for public use or under what license they might be released."
