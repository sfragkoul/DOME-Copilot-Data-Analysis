  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from patients with unresectable Stage III NSCLC who were treated with either chemoradiotherapy (CRT) alone or CRT followed by immunotherapy (IO) consolidation. The study involved a total of 165 patients, who were divided into two main cohorts. Cohort 1 included patients who received IO after CRT, further subdivided into D1, D2, and D3 cohorts. Cohort 2, labeled as D4, consisted of patients who were treated with CRT alone.\n\nThe patients were recruited from two hospitals over a period from 2019 to 2023. The inclusion criteria for the study required a pathological diagnosis of NSCLC, complete clinical data including smoking status, treatment details, and survival outcomes, and accessible pretreatment CT scans. Exclusion criteria included a history of another primary malignancy, lack of baseline characteristics and/or CT images, and tumor boundaries that were not clearly defined, making accurate delineation impossible.\n\nThe dataset included baseline tissue samples from 31 out of 59 patients and blood samples from 57 out of 59 patients. Among these, 30 patients had both tissue and blood samples, with 11 in the D3 group and 19 in the D4 group. Additionally, 40 patients provided both baseline and post-radiation blood samples.\n\nThe radiomic features were extracted from CT images using the Pyradiomics tool within the 3D-Slicer software. A total of 1834 radiomic features were initially extracted from each patient's region of interest (ROI). These features underwent a series of statistical and machine learning techniques, including the Mann\u2013Whitney U test, Pearson's rank correlation coefficient, and LASSO regression, to identify the most predictive features.\n\nThe dataset has not been previously used in other published papers or by the community, as this study represents the first exploration of integrating genomic data and radiomic analysis to identify prognostic biomarkers for Stage III unresectable NSCLC treated with definitive CRT and IO.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into four distinct cohorts. The first cohort, referred to as Cohort 1, consisted of 132 patients and was further split into three groups: D1 with 74 patients, D2 with 32 patients, and D3 with 26 patients. The D1 and D2 groups served as the training and validation sets, respectively. The second cohort, D4, included 33 patients and served as an additional test set. The D3 cohort also functioned as a test set. The distribution of patients across these cohorts was designed to evaluate the performance of the radiomic model in different scenarios, including those receiving immunotherapy after chemoradiotherapy and those treated with chemoradiotherapy alone.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset consisted of 165 cases of unresectable Stage III NSCLC patients who received either chemoradiotherapy (CRT) alone or immunotherapy (IO) following CRT. These cases were divided into two main cohorts. Cohort 1 included patients who received IO after CRT, further split into three subgroups: D1 (74 patients), D2 (32 patients), and D3 (26 patients). Cohort 2, labeled as D4, consisted of 33 patients who were treated with CRT alone.\n\nThe D1 and D2 subgroups served as the training and validation sets, respectively. The D3 and D4 subgroups were used as test sets. This division ensured that the training and test sets were independent, with no overlap between them. The independence of the sets was enforced by the study design, which allocated different patient groups to each subset based on their treatment regimens and the timing of data collection.\n\nThe distribution of the dataset aimed to reflect real-world clinical scenarios, ensuring that the model's performance could be generalized to similar patient populations. The inclusion criteria focused on patients with a pathological diagnosis of NSCLC, complete clinical data, and accessible pretreatment CT scans. Exclusion criteria removed patients with a history of another primary malignancy, lack of baseline characteristics or CT images, and tumors with poorly defined boundaries.\n\nThe dataset's structure and splitting strategy were designed to mimic previously published machine learning datasets in medical research, emphasizing the importance of independent training and test sets to validate the model's robustness and generalizability. This approach helps in assessing the model's performance accurately and ensures that the findings are reliable and applicable to broader clinical settings.",
  "dataset/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our study falls under the class of regularized regression techniques, specifically the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression. This method is well-established in the field of machine learning and statistics, known for its ability to perform both variable selection and regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the statistical model.\n\nThe LASSO regression algorithm is not new; it has been extensively used and validated in various domains, including biomedical research. The choice of LASSO regression in our study was driven by its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data, which is characteristic of radiomic features. By incorporating a penalty term that shrinks some coefficient estimates to zero, LASSO helps in selecting a subset of the most relevant features, thereby improving the model's performance and reducing overfitting.\n\nThe decision to use LASSO regression in our context was based on its proven track record in similar applications rather than the novelty of the algorithm itself. Given that our primary focus is on the application of radiomics and genomics in cancer treatment, the use of a well-established machine-learning technique like LASSO ensures robustness and reliability in our findings. Therefore, publishing the algorithm in a machine-learning journal was not necessary, as the innovation lies in the application and integration of these techniques within the medical domain.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model developed in this research does not function as a meta-predictor. Instead, it relies on radiomic features extracted from medical imaging data to predict progression-free survival (PFS) after chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by immunotherapy (IO) in locally unresectable advanced Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nThe radiomics model utilizes a combination of feature selection techniques, including the Mann\u2013Whitney U test, Pearson's rank correlation coefficient, and a greedy recursive deletion strategy, to identify the most predictive radiomic features. These features are then integrated using a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model to produce a Rad-score. The Rad-score is used to stratify patients into low-risk and high-risk groups for disease progression.\n\nWhile the model incorporates advanced machine learning techniques, it does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. The focus is on extracting and analyzing radiomic features directly from the imaging data. The training and validation of the model were performed on independent cohorts to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the results. The D1 and D2 cohorts served as the training and validation sets, respectively, while the D3 and D4 cohorts were used as test sets to evaluate the model's performance. This approach ensures that the training data is independent and that the model's predictions are not biased by the training process.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure the comparability and reliability of the radiomic features. Initially, Z-scores were used to normalize the data, which helped to standardize the features across different patients. This normalization is crucial for maintaining the consistency of the data, especially when dealing with various imaging parameters.\n\nFollowing normalization, a Mann\u2013Whitney U test was applied to screen the radiomic features. This statistical test helped in retaining only those features that showed a significant p-value of less than 0.05, ensuring that the selected features were relevant and had a meaningful impact on the analysis.\n\nTo address inter-feature correlation, Pearson's rank correlation coefficient was calculated for highly repeatable features. Features with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.9 were considered redundant, and only one feature from each highly correlated pair was retained. This step was essential for reducing redundancy and enhancing the model's efficiency.\n\nA greedy recursive deletion strategy was employed to further refine the feature set. This method systematically eliminated the most redundant features in each iteration, maximizing the representation of the remaining features. This approach ensured that the final set of features was both informative and non-redundant.\n\nAdditionally, preprocessing techniques such as voxel resampling and gray-intensity normalization were applied to the CT images. Voxel resampling standardized the pixel spacing across all images, ensuring uniform voxel dimensions of 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm. Gray-intensity normalization standardized the intensity value range, minimizing variations unrelated to tissue properties. These preprocessing steps were vital for maintaining the consistency and accuracy of the radiomic feature extraction process.\n\nThe optimal parameter lambda (\u03bb) was determined using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model via 10-fold cross-validation. This process aimed to minimize the mean square error, identifying the most predictive features and their respective weight coefficients for progression-free survival (PFS). The chosen features and their corresponding weight coefficients were then integrated linearly to produce the Rad-score, which served as a critical component in the predictive modeling process.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we employed a radiomics model that utilized a specific set of radiomic features to predict progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with unresectable Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The selection of these features involved a rigorous process to ensure the most predictive and non-redundant features were included.\n\nInitially, 1834 radiomic features were extracted from each patient's region of interest (ROI) using the Pyradiomics technique via the 3D-Slicer software. To narrow down these features, a Mann\u2013Whitney U test was conducted, retaining only those with a p-value less than 0.05, resulting in 451 features. Further filtering was done using Pearson's rank correlation coefficient to assess inter-feature correlation, retaining only one feature from pairs with a coefficient greater than 0.9. This step ensured that highly correlated features were not redundantly included.\n\nTo maximize feature representation, a greedy recursive deletion strategy was employed, eliminating the most redundant features in each iteration. The optimal number of features (p) was determined using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model via 10-fold cross-validation. This process aimed to minimize the mean square error, identifying the most predictive features and their respective weight coefficients for PFS. Ultimately, eight radiomic features with non-zero coefficients were selected for the final model. These features and their corresponding weight coefficients were integrated linearly to produce the Rad-score, which was used to stratify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups for disease progression.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we initially extracted 1834 radiomic features from each patient's region of interest using the Pyradiomics technique via the 3D-Slicer software. To ensure the robustness and relevance of these features, we performed feature selection using the training set only. This process involved several steps:\n\nFirst, we applied the Mann\u2013Whitney U test to retain features with a p-value less than 0.05, resulting in 451 radiomic features. Next, we used Pearson's rank correlation coefficient to assess inter-feature correlation, retaining only one feature from pairs with a coefficient greater than 0.9 to minimize redundancy. We then employed a greedy recursive deletion strategy to further eliminate the most redundant features in each iteration. Finally, we used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model with 10-fold cross-validation to determine the optimal parameter lambda (\u03bb), which helped in identifying the most predictive features and their respective weight coefficients for progression-free survival (PFS). This process ultimately led to the selection of eight radiomic features, which were used to construct the Rad-score. These selected features and their corresponding weight coefficients were integrated linearly to produce the Rad-score, which was then used to stratify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups for disease progression.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study involved a comprehensive approach to handle the high-dimensional radiomic feature space and ensure robust model performance. The number of radiomic features initially extracted was significantly larger than the number of training points, which could potentially lead to overfitting. To mitigate this risk, several strategies were implemented.\n\nFirst, feature selection techniques were applied to reduce the dimensionality of the data. The Mann\u2013Whitney U test was used to retain only those features with a p-value less than 0.05, ensuring that the selected features were statistically significant. Additionally, Pearson's rank correlation coefficient was calculated to assess inter-feature correlation, retaining only one feature from pairs with a coefficient greater than 0.9. This step helped in eliminating redundant features and reducing the risk of overfitting.\n\nFurthermore, a greedy recursive deletion strategy was employed to maximize feature representation and eliminate the most redundant features in each iteration. This iterative process ensured that the final set of features was both relevant and non-redundant.\n\nTo determine the optimal parameters, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model was used with 10-fold cross-validation. This technique helped in identifying the most predictive features and their respective weight coefficients for progression-free survival (PFS). The cross-validation process ensured that the model generalized well to unseen data, thereby ruling out overfitting.\n\nTo address the risk of underfitting, the model's performance was evaluated using various metrics, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and the concordance index (C-index). The radiomic model demonstrated strong predictive performance across different cohorts, with AUC values ranging from 0.664 to 0.899 and C-index values ranging from 0.516 to 0.820. These metrics indicated that the model was neither too simple nor too complex, striking a balance between bias and variance.\n\nIn summary, the fitting method involved rigorous feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and cross-validation techniques to ensure that the model was neither overfitted nor underfitted. The use of LASSO regression with cross-validation, along with the evaluation of performance metrics, provided a robust framework for developing a predictive radiomic model.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our radiomic model. One of the key methods used was the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. This technique is particularly effective in high-dimensional data settings, as it performs both variable selection and regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the model. By using 10-fold cross-validation, we determined the optimal lambda (\u03bb) parameter, which minimizes the mean square error and helps in selecting the most predictive features. This process not only reduces the complexity of the model but also mitigates the risk of overfitting by penalizing less important features.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized the Mann\u2013Whitney U test to screen radiomic features, retaining only those with a p-value less than 0.05. This statistical test helped in identifying features that were significantly different between the groups, thereby reducing the number of irrelevant features and enhancing the model's performance.\n\nTo further ensure the reliability of the selected features, we applied Pearson's rank correlation coefficient to assess inter-feature correlation. Features with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.9 were considered redundant, and only one feature from each highly correlated pair was retained. This step helped in eliminating redundant information and improving the model's generalization capability.\n\nMoreover, we employed a greedy recursive deletion strategy to maximize feature representation. This iterative process involved eliminating the most redundant features in each step, ensuring that the final set of features was both informative and non-redundant. This approach contributed to the model's ability to generalize well to new, unseen data.\n\nOverall, these regularization techniques collectively helped in building a robust radiomic model that is less prone to overfitting and more reliable in predicting progression-free survival in patients with unresectable Stage III NSCLC.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters used in our study are detailed within the text. Specifically, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model was employed with 10-fold cross-validation to determine the optimal parameter lambda (\u03bb), aiming to minimize the mean square error. This process identified the most predictive radiomic features and their respective weight coefficients for progression-free survival (PFS).\n\nThe radiomic features and their corresponding weight coefficients were integrated linearly to produce the Rad-score. The point on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve with the largest Youden index was selected as the cut-off value for the Rad-score.\n\nThe specific radiomic features and their coefficients are provided in the text, allowing for reproducibility. For instance, the Rad-score is calculated using features such as `lbp_3D_m2_glszm_GrayLevelNonUniformityNormalized`, `lbp_3D_k_glszm_LowGrayLevelZoneEmphasis`, and others, with their respective coefficients.\n\nHowever, model files and explicit optimization schedules are not directly provided in the text. The methods and tools used, such as Python (v 3.9), R (v 4.2.2), and SPSS (v 26.0), are mentioned, but the specific scripts or model files are not included. The data sets used are available upon reasonable request from the corresponding author.\n\nRegarding licensing, there is no specific mention of licenses for the data or models. However, the use of open-source software like Python, R, and specific packages (e.g., `timeROC`, `rms`, `Hs.eg.db`, `clusterProfiler`, `enrichplot`) suggests that these tools are freely available under their respective open-source licenses.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in our study is not entirely a black box, as it incorporates interpretable features and methods to enhance transparency. We employed a radiomics approach, which involves extracting quantitative features from medical images. These features are then used to build a predictive model. The process of feature selection and model construction includes several steps that contribute to interpretability.\n\nFirstly, we used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model to select the most predictive radiomic features. This method not only identifies the relevant features but also provides weight coefficients for each feature, indicating their importance in the model. For instance, features such as `lbp_3D_m2_glszm_GrayLevelNonUniformityNormalized`, `lbp_3D_k_glszm_LowGrayLevelZoneEmphasis`, and `lbp_3D_m2_gldm_DependenceEntropy` were selected with specific coefficients, showing their contribution to the prediction of progression-free survival (PFS).\n\nAdditionally, we constructed a Rad-score by linearly integrating the selected features and their corresponding weight coefficients. This Rad-score serves as a quantitative measure that stratifies patients into low-risk and high-risk groups based on a cutoff value of 0.157. Patients with a Rad-score of 0.157 or lower are classified as low risk, while those with a higher score are considered high risk. This stratification provides a clear and interpretable way to understand the model's predictions.\n\nFurthermore, we performed univariate Cox regression analyses to establish the Rad-score as a predictor of PFS. The results showed that the Rad-score was significantly associated with PFS in all patients, with a p-value of less than 0.001. This statistical analysis adds another layer of interpretability by demonstrating the model's predictive power in a clinically relevant context.\n\nIn summary, while the model leverages complex radiomic features and machine learning techniques, it is designed with interpretability in mind. The use of LASSO regression for feature selection, the construction of the Rad-score, and the application of univariate Cox regression analyses all contribute to a more transparent and understandable model. This approach allows clinicians to gain insights into the underlying factors driving the model's predictions, thereby enhancing its practical utility in clinical settings.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is primarily a regression model, specifically designed to predict progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with unresectable Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have undergone chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by immunotherapy (IO). The model uses radiomic features extracted from CT scans to compute a Rad-score, which serves as a continuous variable. This Rad-score is then used to stratify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups based on an optimum cut-off value of 0.157. The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and the concordance index (C-index), which are typical for regression models aimed at predicting continuous outcomes like PFS. Additionally, the model's predictive power was assessed through univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, further confirming its regression nature.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time for the model was not explicitly detailed in the publication. However, the process involved several steps, including data normalization, feature selection, and model training, which collectively contributed to the overall time required. The normalization of radiomic features using Z-scores and the execution of the Mann\u2013Whitney U test were initial steps. Feature selection involved calculating Pearson's rank correlation coefficient and employing a greedy recursive deletion strategy, which likely added to the computational time. The LASSO regression model, used to determine the optimal parameter lambda (\u03bb) via 10-fold cross-validation, was a critical step in identifying the most predictive features. Additionally, the construction of the Rad-score and the subsequent ROC curve analysis further contributed to the execution time. While specific timings are not provided, these steps collectively indicate a comprehensive and time-intensive process aimed at developing an accurate predictive model.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the radiomics model involved several key steps to ensure its robustness and predictive accuracy. Initially, the model was developed using a training set comprising patients from the D1 cohort. The optimal parameter lambda (\u03bb) was determined through 10-fold cross-validation to minimize the mean square error, which helped in identifying the most predictive radiomic features and their respective weight coefficients for progression-free survival (PFS).\n\nFollowing the development phase, the model's performance was assessed using validation and test sets. The D2 cohort served as the validation set, allowing for an initial evaluation of the model's generalizability. Subsequently, the D3 and D4 cohorts were used as test sets to further validate the model's predictive capabilities in different patient groups. The D3 cohort included patients who received immunotherapy after chemoradiotherapy, while the D4 cohort consisted of patients treated with chemoradiotherapy alone.\n\nThe predictive performance of the radiomics model was quantified using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and the concordance index (C-index). The AUC values for predicting PFS probability were 0.817 in the D1 cohort, 0.899 in the D2 cohort, 0.703 in the D3 cohort, and 0.664 in the D4 cohort. The C-index values were 0.764 in the D1 cohort, 0.820 in the D2 cohort, 0.625 in the D3 cohort, and 0.516 in the D4 cohort. These metrics indicated the model's ability to discriminate between patients with different PFS outcomes.\n\nAdditionally, Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank tests were employed to compare the survival distributions between high-risk and low-risk groups stratified by the Rad-score. The results showed that patients classified as high-risk based on their Rad-score experienced significantly shorter PFS compared to their low-risk counterparts in the D1, D2, and D3 cohorts.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation method involved a combination of cross-validation, independent dataset testing, and survival analysis to comprehensively assess the model's predictive performance and clinical utility.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed several performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of our radiomics model in predicting progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with locally unresectable advanced Stage III NSCLC. The primary metrics reported include the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the concordance index (C-index).\n\nThe AUC was calculated for different cohorts to assess the model's ability to discriminate between patients who would experience disease progression and those who would not. Specifically, we reported AUC values for the D1, D2, D3, and D4 cohorts. For instance, in the D1 cohort, the AUC reached 0.817, indicating strong predictive performance. Similarly, the D2 cohort showed an AUC of 0.899, further validating the model's robustness. The AUC values for the D3 and D4 cohorts were 0.703 and 0.664, respectively, which, while lower, still demonstrate the model's utility in different patient groups.\n\nIn addition to the AUC, we also reported the C-index, which measures the model's concordance between predicted and observed survival times. The C-index values for the D1 and D2 cohorts were 0.764 and 0.820, respectively, indicating good agreement between predicted and actual outcomes. The C-index for the D3 cohort was 0.625, and for the D4 cohort, it was 0.516, suggesting varying levels of model performance across different datasets.\n\nThese metrics are widely used in the literature for evaluating predictive models in oncology, ensuring that our results are comparable with other studies in the field. The use of both AUC and C-index provides a comprehensive assessment of the model's discriminative ability and its concordance with actual patient outcomes, making our evaluation representative and robust.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our radiomics model includes several performance metrics, each accompanied by confidence intervals to provide a measure of uncertainty. For instance, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for predicting progression-free survival (PFS) probability was reported with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) across different cohorts. In the D1 cohort, the AUC was 0.817 (95% CI: 0.703\u20130.932), and in the D2 cohort, it was 0.899 (95% CI: 0.756 \u20131.000). The concordance index (C-index) for the radiomics model was also provided with CIs, such as 0.764 (95% CI: 0.682\u20130.846) in the D1 cohort and 0.820 (95% CI: 0.731\u20130.908) in the D2 cohort.\n\nStatistical significance was assessed using various tests. The Mann\u2013Whitney U test was used to screen radiomic features, retaining only those with a p-value less than 0.05. The log-rank test was employed to evaluate differences in survival between groups, and the Cox proportional hazards regression models were used for univariate and multivariate analyses. The results indicated that the Rad-score was a significant predictor of PFS (p < 0.001). Additionally, the radiomic model successfully stratified patients into high-risk and low-risk groups, with significant differences in PFS observed between these groups in the D1, D2, and D3 cohorts (p = 0.00018, p = 0.0046, and p = 0.0027, respectively).\n\nOverall, the performance metrics and statistical tests provide a robust evaluation of the radiomics model, supporting the claim that it is effective in predicting PFS after chemoradiotherapy followed by immunotherapy in locally unresectable advanced Stage III non-small cell lung cancer.",
