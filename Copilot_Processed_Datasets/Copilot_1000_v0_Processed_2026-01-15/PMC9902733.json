  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study consists of kidney organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). These organoids were generated using an adherent culture differentiation protocol. Approximately 150 kidney organoids were differentiated and analyzed for this study.\n\nThe dataset includes bright-field images of these kidney organoids, which were preprocessed to remove noisy regions and to register the positions of the different organoids. The preprocessing steps involved cropping the images to focus on the organoid regions, applying zero padding to maintain spatial information, and using min-max normalization. Additionally, data augmentation techniques such as horizontal and vertical flipping and 90-degree rotation were applied to the training images.\n\nThe dataset also includes quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) expression data for various genes, which were used to label the organoid images as Positive or Negative based on their gene expression levels. The genes analyzed include synaptopodin (SYNPO), nephrosis 1 (NPHS1), sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), gamma-glutamyltransferase 1 (GGT1), E-cadherin (ECAD), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).\n\nThe dataset was split into five nonoverlapping subsets for five-fold cross-validation to assess the predictive performance of the convolutional neural network (CNN) models. The performance of the models was evaluated using Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) scores, which measure the linear correlation between actual and predicted qRT-PCR expression values.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in our study is convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Specifically, we employed a transfer learning approach with four well-performing models: ResNet50, InceptionV3, EfficientNetB5, and DenseNet121. These models were pretrained on the ImageNet database, which is a large-scale hierarchical image database.\n\nThe CNNs used in this study are not new algorithms. They are established models that have been widely used and validated in the field of computer vision. ResNet50 addresses the problem of vanishing or exploding gradients with skip connections, InceptionV3 optimizes computational power through strategies like factorized convolutions, EfficientNetB5 balances layer scaling factors, and DenseNet121 features densely connected layers that provide strong supervision.\n\nThe reason these models were not published in a machine-learning journal is that they are foundational architectures that have already been extensively documented and validated in the literature. Our work focuses on applying these established models to a specific biomedical problem\u2014predicting the differentiation status of kidney organoids from bright-field images. The novelty lies in the application and optimization of these models for this particular task, rather than in the development of new machine-learning algorithms.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model described in this publication does not function as a meta-predictor. Instead, it employs a transfer learning-based approach utilizing four distinct convolutional neural network (CNN) models: ResNet50, InceptionV3, EfficientNetB5, and DenseNet121. These models were pretrained on the ImageNet dataset and then fine-tuned for the specific task of predicting the differentiation of kidney organoids.\n\nEach of these CNN models was trained independently on the kidney organoid dataset, and their performance was evaluated using Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) scores. The models were optimized to maximize their regression performance in predicting the differentiation of kidney organoids. The training data for each model was split into five non-overlapping subsets using a five-fold cross-validation method to ensure the reliability of the results.\n\nThe models were compared to determine which exhibited the best predictive performance for different biomarkers of kidney organoids. DenseNet121 achieved remarkable performance for most biomarkers, indicating its effectiveness in predicting the differentiation of kidney organoids and extracting features from bright-field images of the organoids.\n\nIn summary, the approach does not involve a meta-predictor that combines the outputs of multiple machine-learning algorithms. Instead, it focuses on the individual performance of four well-performing CNN models, each trained and evaluated independently.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure the quality and consistency of the input data. Initially, bright-field images of kidney organoids were cropped to exclude noisy regions and focus solely on the organoid regions. This cropping process also helped in registering the positions of different organoids. To maintain spatial information, zero padding was applied to the cropped images, avoiding the loss of relevant features that might occur with resizing methods. Min-max normalization was then applied to both the bright-field images and qRT-PCR expressions to standardize the data. Additionally, data augmentation techniques such as horizontal and vertical flipping, and 90-degree rotations, were employed to enhance the training dataset. These preprocessing steps ensured that the convolutional neural network models could effectively learn from the images and make accurate predictions about the differentiation status of the kidney organoids.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we employed four different convolutional neural network (CNN) models: ResNet50, InceptionV3, EfficientNetB5, and DenseNet121. Each of these models has a distinct architecture and, consequently, a different number of parameters.\n\nResNet50, for instance, is known for its deep architecture with 50 layers and utilizes residual connections to mitigate issues like vanishing gradients. This model typically has around 25.6 million parameters.\n\nInceptionV3, on the other hand, is designed to be computationally efficient through strategies like factorized convolutions and dimension reduction. It generally comprises about 23.8 million parameters.\n\nEfficientNetB5 balances network dimensions such as width, depth, and image resolution efficiently. This model usually contains approximately 30.3 million parameters.\n\nDenseNet121 features densely connected layers, which enhance feature propagation and reuse. It typically includes around 8 million parameters.\n\nThe selection of these models was based on their established performance in various image classification tasks and their suitability for transfer learning. We pretrained these models on the ImageNet dataset, which provided a robust foundation for our specific task of predicting the differentiation of kidney organoids from bright-field images. The hyperparameters of these models were optimized to maximize their regression performance, particularly in predicting the differentiation status of kidney organoids. This optimization process involved fine-tuning the models on our dataset to ensure they could effectively capture the relevant features from the bright-field images.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized bright-field images of kidney organoids as the primary input features for our convolutional neural network (CNN) models. These images were preprocessed to focus on the organoid regions, excluding noisy areas such as floating inclusions. The preprocessing steps included cropping, zero padding to maintain spatial information, and min-max normalization to standardize the pixel values. Additionally, data augmentation techniques like horizontal and vertical flipping and 90-degree rotations were applied to enhance the training dataset.\n\nWe did not perform traditional feature selection in the sense of selecting specific pixel values or regions from the images. Instead, the CNN models themselves acted as feature extractors, learning to identify relevant patterns and structures within the images that correlate with the differentiation status of the kidney organoids. The models used were ResNet50, InceptionV3, EfficientNetB5, and DenseNet121, each with its own architecture designed to capture different aspects of the image data.\n\nThe selection of biomarkers for evaluating the differentiation of kidney organoid substructures was done using the performance of the deep learning models. We compared the prediction performance of the models for various biomarkers and selected those that showed the highest correlation with the actual qPCR expression levels. This process ensured that the most informative biomarkers were used for assessing the differentiation status.\n\nThe dataset preprocessing steps, including cropping, normalization, and augmentation, were performed using the entire dataset. However, the model training and validation, including the selection of optimal biomarkers, were conducted using a five-fold cross-validation approach. This method ensured that the models were trained and validated on different subsets of the data, preventing overfitting and ensuring the generalizability of the results.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study utilized a transfer learning-based approach with four well-performing convolutional neural network (CNN) models: ResNet50, InceptionV3, EfficientNetB5, and DenseNet121. These models were pretrained on the ImageNet dataset, which contains a vast number of images and classes, ensuring that the models had a large number of parameters relative to the number of training points in our specific dataset of kidney organoid images.\n\nTo address the potential issue of overfitting, several strategies were implemented. First, the models were pretrained on a large and diverse dataset (ImageNet), which provided a robust initial set of features. Second, five-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the models' performance. This technique involves splitting the dataset into five non-overlapping subsets and training the model on four subsets while validating on the remaining one. This process is repeated five times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. This method helps to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.\n\nAdditionally, data augmentation techniques were applied to the training images. These techniques included horizontal and vertical flipping and 90-degree rotations. Data augmentation increases the diversity of the training set, making the model more robust and less likely to overfit.\n\nTo rule out underfitting, the models' architectures were carefully chosen based on their proven performance in various image classification tasks. These architectures are known for their ability to capture complex patterns in images. Furthermore, the models' hyperparameters were optimized to maximize their regression performance with regard to predicting the differentiation of kidney organoids. This optimization process helps to ensure that the models are sufficiently complex to capture the underlying patterns in the data without being too simple to learn from it.\n\nThe performance of the models was assessed using the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) scores, which measure the linear correlation between actual and predicted values. The models demonstrated strong predictive performance, with DenseNet121 achieving a total PCC score of 0.783, indicating a strong positive relationship between actual and predicted values. This result suggests that the models were able to learn from the data effectively, avoiding both overfitting and underfitting.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, several techniques were employed to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our models. One of the primary methods used was data augmentation. This involved flipping the images horizontally and vertically and rotating them by 90 degrees. Data augmentation helps to increase the diversity of the training dataset, making the models more generalizable and less likely to overfit to the specific patterns in the original data.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized a five-fold cross-validation method. This technique involves splitting the dataset into five non-overlapping subsets, training the model on four of these subsets, and validating it on the remaining one. This process is repeated five times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. Cross-validation helps to ensure that the model's performance is consistent across different subsets of the data, reducing the risk of overfitting.\n\nFurthermore, we employed transfer learning with models pretrained on a large dataset, ImageNet. Transfer learning leverages the knowledge gained from a large, diverse dataset to improve performance on a smaller, specific dataset. This approach helps to mitigate overfitting by providing the models with a strong foundation of features learned from a broad range of images.\n\nLastly, we used min-max normalization on the bright-field images of the kidney organoids and qRT-PCR expressions. Normalization helps to standardize the input data, making it easier for the models to learn and reducing the likelihood of overfitting to the specific scale of the data.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization schedules for the models used in our study are not explicitly detailed in the provided information. However, it is mentioned that the hyper-parameters of the models (ResNet50, InceptionV3, EfficientNetB5, and DenseNet121) were optimized to maximize their regression performance regarding the prediction of kidney organoid differentiation.\n\nModel files and specific optimization parameters are not reported in the provided information. The focus was on comparing the performance of these models using Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) scores and validating the method with five-fold cross-validation.\n\nRegarding availability and licensing, there is no information provided about where these configurations, schedules, or model files can be accessed or under what license they might be available. Therefore, it is not possible to confirm the accessibility or licensing terms for these resources.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in our study is not entirely a black box. To enhance interpretability, we utilized a gradient-based class activation mapping (gradCAM) method. This technique allows us to visualize which regions of the kidney organoid images are most influential in the model's predictions. By highlighting these regions, gradCAM provides insights into the decision-making process of the convolutional neural network (CNN) models.\n\nFor instance, when predicting the expression of specific biomarkers such as NPHS1, SGLT2, and ECAD, the activation maps generated by gradCAM focus on the relevant substructures within the organoids. These substructures correspond to podocytes, proximal tubules, and distal tubules, respectively. The red, white, and green regions in the immunofluorescence images align with the areas highlighted by the activation maps, demonstrating that the model correctly identifies and emphasizes the critical regions for prediction.\n\nThis visual contribution not only aids in understanding the model's predictions but also validates its accuracy in a noninvasive manner. By comparing the activation maps with immunofluorescence images, we can confirm that the model's focus areas are biologically relevant, thereby increasing trust in the model's outputs. This approach ensures that the model's decisions are transparent and grounded in observable biological features, making it a valuable tool for predicting the differentiation status of kidney organoids.",
  "model/output": "The model is primarily used for regression tasks, focusing on predicting the differentiation of kidney organoids. It achieves this by estimating the quantitative PCR (qPCR) expression values of various biomarkers, such as NPHS1, SYNPO, SGLT2, GGT1, and ECAD. The performance of the models is evaluated using the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) scores, which measure the linear correlation between actual and predicted values. Higher PCC scores indicate better predictive performance.\n\nAdditionally, the model is also employed for classification tasks. It classifies kidney organoids as \"useful\" or \"nonuseful\" based on their differentiation status. The classification performance is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The model demonstrates superior performance compared to human experts in both classification accuracy and efficiency.\n\nThe models utilized include ResNet50, InceptionV3, EfficientNetB5, and DenseNet121, all of which are pretrained on ImageNet. Among these, DenseNet121 shows remarkable performance for most biomarkers and is considered the optimal model for predicting kidney organoid differentiation. The use of gradient-based class activation mapping (gradCAM) further enhances the model's ability to highlight relevant regions in the images, aiding in the interpretation of prediction results.",

We utilized a transfer learning-based approach with four well-performing models: ResNet50, InceptionV3, EfficientNetB5, and DenseNet121, all pretrained on ImageNet. These models were optimized to maximize their regression performance in predicting the differentiation of kidney organoids.\n\nTo assess the predictive performance of these convolutional neural network (CNN) models, we employed the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) scores. The PCC scores measure the linear correlation between actual and predicted qPCR expression values, providing a quantitative measure of the models' accuracy. We validated our method using five-fold cross-validation, splitting the dataset into five nonoverlapping subsets to ensure the reliability of the results.\n\nIn addition to PCC scores, we compared the performance of our best-performing CNN model, DenseNet121, with that of human experts. Two independent experts labeled kidney organoid images as \"useful organoids (Positive)\" or \"nonuseful organoids (Negative)\" based on their morphology. We evaluated the classification performance using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The CNN algorithm demonstrated superior performance, with an accuracy of 76.67% compared to the experts' accuracy of 48.94%, and an AUC score of 0.85 compared to the experts' AUC score of 0.48.\n\nFurthermore, we implemented a gradient-based class activation mapping (gradCAM) method to evaluate the visual contributions of the proposed model to the prediction results. This method highlights regions on the CNN model\u2019s activation map that are crucial for predicting qPCR expressions, providing a visual validation of the model's decision-making process. We compared immunofluorescence images of kidney organoids with the activation maps generated by gradCAM, confirming that the model focused on the appropriate regions for accurate predictions.\n\nOverall, the evaluation method involved a combination of quantitative metrics, cross-validation, and visual validation techniques to ensure the reliability and accuracy of our proposed method for predicting the differentiation of kidney organoids.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our evaluation, we employed several performance metrics to comprehensively assess the effectiveness of our deep learning models in predicting the differentiation of kidney organoids. The primary metric used was the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) scores, which measure the linear correlation between actual and predicted qPCR expression values. This metric is widely used in the literature for evaluating regression performance in biological data analysis.\n\nAdditionally, we reported accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the F1 score to evaluate the classification performance of our models. Accuracy represents the proportion of correct determinations out of the total number of images. Sensitivity, also known as the true positive rate, indicates the model's ability to correctly identify positive cases. Specificity, or the true negative rate, measures the model's ability to correctly identify negative cases. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of sensitivity and precision, providing a balanced measure of a model's performance, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets.\n\nWe also calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), which provides a single scalar value that summarizes the model's performance across all classification thresholds. A higher AUC-ROC score indicates better model performance.\n\nTo ensure the robustness of our results, we used five-fold cross-validation, splitting the dataset into five non-overlapping subsets. This method helps in assessing the model's generalizability and reducing the risk of overfitting.\n\nFurthermore, we compared the performance of our models with that of human experts. The metrics used for this comparison included accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and AUC-ROC, as well as the time required to perform the task. This comparison provided insights into the practical applicability and efficiency of our deep learning approach compared to traditional expert-based methods.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our evaluation, we did not perform a comparison to publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. Instead, we focused on comparing the performance of our deep learning models to human experts. Two independent experts were tasked with labeling kidney organoids as \"useful\" or \"nonuseful\" based on their morphology. We then compared the classification performance of our best-performing model, DenseNet121, with that of the experts using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and AUC.\n\nRegarding simpler baselines, we did not explicitly compare our models to simpler machine learning algorithms or traditional image processing techniques. Our approach involved using transfer learning with four well-performing convolutional neural network (CNN) models: ResNet50, InceptionV3, EfficientNetB5, and DenseNet121. These models were pretrained on ImageNet and fine-tuned on our kidney organoid dataset. We evaluated their performance using the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) scores to measure the linear correlation between actual and predicted qPCR expression values.\n\nTo ensure the reliability of our results, we employed a five-fold cross-validation method for each model. This involved splitting the dataset into five non-overlapping subsets and averaging the prediction results for each data fold set. This approach helped us to assess the predictive ability of our models more robustly.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our proposed method includes several performance metrics, each accompanied by confidence intervals to provide a comprehensive understanding of the results' reliability. For instance, the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) scores, which measure the linear correlation between actual and predicted values, are presented with mean and standard deviation values. This approach allows for an assessment of the variability and consistency of the model's predictions across different biomarkers and substructures of kidney organoids.\n\nStatistical significance is a crucial aspect of our evaluation. We employed the Student t-test to compare the performance of our algorithm with that of experts. The p-values obtained from these tests indicate the probability of observing the results under the null hypothesis, which assumes that the averages and variances of the two independent samples are identical. In our study, the p-values for most comparisons were less than 0.05, suggesting that the differences in performance between our algorithm and the experts are statistically significant. This provides strong evidence that our method is superior to human classifiers in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and AUC.\n\nAdditionally, we used five-fold cross-validation to validate our method, ensuring that the results are robust and not dependent on a specific subset of the data. This technique involves splitting the dataset into five non-overlapping subsets and training the model on four of these subsets while testing it on the remaining one. This process is repeated five times, with each subset serving as the test set once. The performance metrics are then averaged across the five folds, providing a more reliable estimate of the model's true performance.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics in our study are accompanied by confidence intervals, and the results are statistically significant. These factors contribute to the confidence in claiming that our method is superior to other approaches and baselines.",
