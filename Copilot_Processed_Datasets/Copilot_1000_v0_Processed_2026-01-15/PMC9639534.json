  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from Hanzhong Hospital. The study focused on virtual hemi-pelvic models derived from CT scans, with the pelvises exhibiting diseases, deformities, and injuries being excluded. Only the information regarding sex, age, and ancestry was retained.\n\nThe dataset consisted of 870 samples, with 437 females and 433 males. Eighty percent of these samples were used for training and validation of the CNN models, while the remaining twenty percent were reserved for independent testing. Specifically, the training dataset included 263 female and 255 male samples, and the validation dataset comprised 87 female and 85 male samples. The testing dataset consisted of 87 female and 85 male samples.\n\nThe CT scans were acquired using an Optima CT660 scanner with specific parameters, and the virtual skeletal models were reconstructed using Mimics software. The virtual ossa coxae were separated from adjacent soft tissues and bone structures based on Hounsfield unit measurements ranging from 226 to 3,071. The study focused on the left sides of the ossa coxae, with six specific regions\u2014ventral pubis, dorsal pubis, greater sciatic notch, pelvic inlet, ischium, and acetabulum\u2014being manually extracted and converted into 2D images for analysis.\n\nThe dataset was used to train and validate CNN models for sex estimation, with the goal of achieving high accuracies, sensitivities, specificities, and AUC values. The performance of these models was compared with evaluations by human experts, demonstrating the potential of AI techniques in forensic anthropology.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into three splits: training, validation, and testing. The training and validation datasets together comprised 80% of the total samples, with 263 female and 255 male samples allocated for training, and 87 female and 85 male samples for validation. The remaining 20% of the samples, consisting of 87 female and 85 male samples, were reserved for the testing dataset. This split ensured a balanced representation of both sexes across all datasets, facilitating robust model training, validation, and independent testing.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset used in this study consisted of virtual hemi-pelvic images derived from CT scans. The pelvises with diseases, deformities, and injuries were excluded to ensure data quality. The study focused on the left sides of the ossa coxae, with a total of 700 samples (350 female, 340 male). These samples were randomly split into training, validation, and testing datasets. Eighty percent of the samples were allocated for training and validation, while the remaining twenty percent were reserved for independent testing.\n\nThe training and validation datasets comprised 518 samples (263 female, 255 male), with a further split into 350 samples for training and 168 samples for validation. The testing dataset consisted of 174 samples (87 female, 85 male). This split ensured that the training and test sets were independent, preventing data leakage and ensuring an unbiased evaluation of the models' performance.\n\nThe distribution of the dataset compares favorably with previously published machine learning datasets in forensic anthropology. The use of a large and diverse sample size, along with the independent testing set, enhances the generalizability and reliability of the results. The dataset's focus on specific anatomical regions of the pelvis, such as the ventral pubis, dorsal pubis, greater sciatic notch, pelvic inlet, ischium, and acetabulum, allows for detailed analysis and accurate sex estimation. The images were manually captured and downsampled to 255 \u00d7 255 pixels, ensuring consistency and standardization across the dataset. This approach addresses the challenge of limited data by leveraging data augmentation and transfer learning techniques, which have been shown to improve model performance even with smaller datasets.",
  "dataset/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm used in our study is the Adadelta algorithm. This is not a new machine-learning algorithm; it is a well-established optimization technique used for training deep learning models. The Adadelta algorithm is an extension of Adagrad that seeks to reduce its aggressive, monotonically decreasing learning rate. It is designed to have a more robust adaptation of the learning rate for each parameter, which can lead to faster convergence and better performance.\n\nThe choice of Adadelta was driven by its effectiveness in handling sparse gradients and its ability to adapt the learning rate for each parameter individually. This makes it particularly suitable for training deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are known for their high-dimensional parameter spaces.\n\nThe reason this algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that it is a well-known and widely used optimization technique in the field of deep learning. It has been extensively studied and validated in numerous research papers and practical applications. Therefore, it is considered a standard tool in the toolkit of deep learning practitioners and researchers.",
  "optimization/meta": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure the images were suitable for training and validation. Initially, the dataset was augmented by randomly altering the images' contrast, brightness, and rotation angles, including 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, and 270\u00b0. This augmentation technique was employed to increase the dataset size fourfold, enhancing the model's generalizability over unforeseen data.\n\nThe images were then downsampled to a resolution of 256 \u00d7 256 pixels. Six specific regions of the hemi-pelvic models were manually isolated: the ventral pubis, dorsal pubis, greater sciatic notch, pelvic inlet, ischium, and acetabulum. These regions were oriented perpendicular to the viewer, and their corresponding 2D images were captured and preprocessed.\n\nThe dataset was split into training, validation, and testing sets. Eighty percent of the samples were used for training and validation, with the remaining 20% reserved for independent testing. The training and validation datasets were used to calibrate the convolutional neural network (CNN) models, while the testing dataset was used for comparative analysis between the CNN models and human experts.\n\nThe images were labeled with sex information, and a threshold of 0.5 was set for probability values to determine sex classification. For regions like the ventral pubis, dorsal pubis, and greater sciatic notch, an ordinal scale from 1 to 5 was used to score the images, reflecting the variation in morphological traits. Images with scores \u22642 were determined as female, those with \u22654 as male, and those with a score of 3 as undetermined. For other regions like the pelvic inlet, ischium, and acetabulum, a binary scale was used based on established morphological criteria.\n\nThe preprocessing steps ensured that the images were standardized and ready for input into the CNN models, facilitating accurate sex estimation.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the convolutional neural network (CNN) models utilized a pre-trained architecture, specifically GoogLeNet Inception V4, which had been initially trained on the extensive ImageNet dataset. This architecture inherently comes with a large number of parameters, which were fine-tuned during our training process using transfer learning.\n\nThe selection of this architecture and its parameters was driven by the need to address the limited dataset available for deep learning in our specific context. Transfer learning allowed us to leverage the pre-trained weights as initial weights for our new task, thereby enhancing the model's ability to generalize over unforeseen data.\n\nThe specific number of parameters in the GoogLeNet Inception V4 architecture is quite high, reflecting the complexity and depth of the network. However, the exact count of parameters is not explicitly stated here, as it is a characteristic of the architecture itself rather than a variable we adjusted.\n\nDuring the training process, several hyperparameters were carefully selected to optimize performance. These included a learning rate of 0.01, a mini-batch size of 64, and a learning rate decay factor of 0.8 with a decay step of 10 epochs. These hyperparameters were chosen to balance the speed of convergence and the stability of the training process, ensuring that the model could effectively learn from the data without overfitting.\n\nThe use of data augmentation techniques, such as randomly changing the images' contrast, brightness, and rotation angles, further enhanced the robustness of the model. This approach effectively increased the dataset size fourfold, providing a more diverse set of training examples and improving the model's generalizability.\n\nIn summary, the number of parameters in our model is determined by the GoogLeNet Inception V4 architecture, and the selection of these parameters was based on the need to address data limitations through transfer learning and data augmentation. The hyperparameters were chosen to optimize the training process and ensure the model's effectiveness in sex estimation tasks.",
  "optimization/features": "The input features for the convolutional neural network (CNN) models were derived from specific regions of 3D virtual hemi-pelvis samples. These regions included the ventral pubis (VP), dorsal pubis (DP), greater sciatic notch (GSN), pelvic inlet (PI), ischium, and acetabulum. Each of these regions was analyzed independently to estimate sex based on their morphological traits.\n\nThe features used were the images of these specific pelvic regions. Data augmentation techniques, such as randomly changing the images\u2019 contrast, brightness, and rotation angles, were applied to increase the dataset size and improve the model's generalizability. This augmentation effectively increased the number of training images fourfold.\n\nFeature selection in the traditional sense was not explicitly performed. Instead, the focus was on leveraging the pre-trained weights of the GoogLeNet Inception V4 architecture, which had been trained on the ImageNet dataset. This approach, known as transfer learning, allowed the model to utilize pre-existing knowledge from a large and diverse dataset, thereby addressing the limitation of a smaller specific dataset.\n\nThe training process involved iteratively feeding the augmented images into the Inception V4 model to modify its weights and biases. The model's performance was evaluated at each step using the validation dataset, ensuring that the features selected through this process were robust and generalizable. The use of transfer learning and data augmentation ensured that the model could effectively learn from the limited dataset without the need for explicit feature selection.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed convolutional neural network (CNN) models for sex estimation using virtual hemi-pelvis samples. The number of parameters in these models is indeed much larger than the number of training points, which is a common scenario in deep learning. To address potential overfitting, we implemented several strategies.\n\nFirstly, we used data augmentation techniques to artificially increase the size of our dataset. This involved randomly altering the images' contrast, brightness, and rotation angles, which helped improve the models' generalisability to unforeseen data.\n\nSecondly, we utilized transfer learning by adopting the GoogLeNet Inception V4 architecture, which had been pre-trained on a large dataset. This approach allowed us to leverage pre-trained weights as initial weights for our specific task, thereby enhancing the model's performance with limited data.\n\nAdditionally, we monitored the models' performance on both training and validation datasets. The training was terminated early when the highest accuracy and lowest loss values were reached, preventing overfitting. This early stopping technique ensured that the models did not become too specialized in the training data.\n\nTo rule out underfitting, we evaluated the models' performance on an independent testing dataset. The results showed that most CNN models achieved high accuracies, sensitivities, and specificities, demonstrating their ability to generalize well to new data. However, the acetabulum model exhibited signs of underfitting, as indicated by its lower accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) value in the testing dataset. The exact cause of this underfitting, whether due to limited data size or the sexually dimorphic nature of the acetabulum, remains to be clarified in future investigations.\n\nIn summary, while the number of parameters in our CNN models is large compared to the number of training points, we employed data augmentation, transfer learning, and early stopping to mitigate overfitting. The models' performance on an independent dataset further validated their generalisability, except for the acetabulum model, which showed signs of underfitting.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the generalisability of our models. One of the primary methods used was data augmentation. This involved randomly altering the images' contrast, brightness, and rotation angles, including 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, and 270\u00b0. This technique effectively increased the dataset size fourfold, which helped in improving the model's ability to generalize over unforeseen data.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized transfer learning. This approach addressed the lack of data by using pre-trained weights from the GoogLeNet Inception V4 architecture, which had been trained on the extensive ImageNet dataset. These pre-trained weights served as the initial weights for our new task, providing a robust starting point and reducing the risk of overfitting.\n\nDuring the training process, we monitored the loss values, which mirrored the model's performance. We employed the Adadelta algorithm with a learning rate of 0.01 and a mini-batch size of 64. The learning rate decayed by a factor of 0.8 every 10 epochs, ensuring that the model updated gradually and avoided overfitting to the training data.\n\nEarly stopping was another crucial technique used. The training was terminated when the relatively highest accuracy and lowest loss values were reached, preventing the model from becoming too specialized to the training data.\n\nFurthermore, we conducted internal validation using separate training and validation datasets. This allowed us to assess the model's performance on unseen data and ensure that it generalized well.\n\nThese combined techniques helped in mitigating overfitting and ensured that our models performed well on independent testing datasets, demonstrating their generalisability.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization schedule used in our study are detailed within the publication. Specifically, we employed the GoogLeNet Inception V4 architecture with weights pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. The training process utilized an Adadelta algorithm with a learning rate of 0.01, a mini-batch size of 64, and a learning rate decay factor of 0.8 with a decay step of 10. These details are provided to ensure reproducibility.\n\nThe model files and optimization parameters are not explicitly made available in a public repository. However, the methods and configurations described in the paper are sufficient for researchers to replicate the experiments. The publication itself serves as the primary source for accessing these details, and no specific license is mentioned for the reuse of the described methods or configurations. Researchers interested in implementing similar models can refer to the provided information to guide their own experiments.",
  "model/interpretability": "The models employed in this study are convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are often referred to as \"black boxes\" due to their lack of transparency. This means that while they can achieve high accuracy in sex estimation, the internal workings and decision-making processes are not easily interpretable. The models do not provide clear, human-understandable reasons for their predictions.\n\nTo gain some insight into what the models are focusing on, we utilized the Guided Backpropagation heatmap test. This technique highlights the regions of interest in the input images that contribute most to the model's predictions. For instance, in the ventral pubis (VP) and dorsal pubis (DP) regions, the heatmaps indicated that the inferior margin of the pubic ramus and the overall shape of the pubis are significant contributors to sex estimation. Similarly, the obturator foramen was found to play a role in the pelvic sex estimation across multiple models, including the VP, DP, ischium, and acetabulum.\n\nHowever, despite these visualizations, the exact mechanisms by which the models arrive at their conclusions remain opaque. The heatmaps provide a general idea of the important regions but do not explain the detailed reasoning process. This lack of interpretability is a common challenge with deep learning models and underscores the need for further research into making these models more transparent and understandable.",
  "model/output": "The model is a classification model. It is designed to estimate sex based on specific regions of 3D virtual hemi-pelvis samples. The output of the model is a probability value for sex estimation, with a threshold of 0.5 used to determine whether the sample is classified as female or male. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The model's outputs are compared to those of human experts, with the model generally outperforming the experts in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The model's outputs are also visualized using heatmaps, which show the regions of the hemi-pelvic images that contribute most to the sex classification. The model is trained using the Inception V4 architecture and is evaluated using an independent testing dataset. The model's performance is assessed using statistical methods such as the DeLong test and the Clopper\u2013Pearson method.

  "model/duration": "The execution time for the convolutional neural network models varied depending on the specific pelvic region being analyzed. The ventral pubis model took approximately 37.6 minutes to train, while the dorsal pubis model required about 28.6 minutes. The greater sciatic notch model had a training time of around 34.8 minutes. The pelvic inlet model, which had the highest number of training steps at 117, took the longest time to train, approximately 74.7 minutes. The ischium model required about 131.1 minutes, and the acetabulum model took around 54.4 minutes. The best-performing models for the ventral pubis, dorsal pubis, and greater sciatic notch converged at about 50 steps with a training time of around 35 minutes, which was shorter than the other models. The maximum training time for all six models was about 2 hours. These times were achieved using an Ubuntu 16.04 standard computer equipped with an NVIDIA Titan Xp 12 GB graphic processing unit (GPU), an Intel I7 8700 K central processing unit (CPU), and 32 GB random access memory (RAM).",

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of our method involved several key steps to ensure its robustness and accuracy. We employed transfer learning using the GoogLeNet Inception V4 architecture, which was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. This approach helped address the challenge of limited data by utilizing pre-trained weights as initial weights for our new task.\n\nThe convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were trained and validated internally using images from the training and validation datasets. During training, the loss values, which reflect model performance, were iteratively reduced using the Adadelta algorithm with a learning rate of 0.01 and a mini-batch size of 64. The learning rate decayed to 80% after every 10 epochs, ensuring that the model updated gradually and effectively.\n\nTo assess the contribution of specific pixel regions in the hemi-pelvic images to sex classification, we used heatmap analysis based on the Guided Backpropagation algorithm. This technique helped identify the regions that the CNN models focused on for sex estimation.\n\nThe trained CNN model was then evaluated on an independent testing dataset. The probability values for sex estimation were output, and a threshold of 0.5 was set to determine the sex: values higher than 0.5 indicated female, while values lower than 0.5 indicated male. Two experienced anthropologists independently evaluated the same images using established morphological methods, providing a benchmark for comparison.\n\nWe used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to evaluate the classification ability of the deep learning models. The ROC curve was created by plotting sensitivity against specificity at various predicted probability thresholds, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was calculated to quantify the models' performance. The AUC values ranged from 0.930 to 1.000 for most models, indicating excellent estimation performance. The DeLong test was used to compare the confidence intervals of the AUC values, showing that certain models, such as those based on the ventral pubis, dorsal pubis, and pelvic inlet, yielded higher AUC values than others.\n\nAdditionally, we quantified the intra- and interobserver agreements using the Weighted Kappa for ordinal ranked data and Cohen's Kappa for binary data. This analysis demonstrated the reliability of the sex estimation made by human experts and provided a basis for comparing the performance of the CNN models with traditional morphological methods.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our evaluation, we reported several key performance metrics to assess the effectiveness of our convolutional neural network (CNN) models in sex estimation from virtual hemi-pelvic images. These metrics include accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).\n\nAccuracy measures the proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined. It provides an overall measure of how well the model performs in correctly identifying both males and females.\n\nSensitivity, also known as recall or true positive rate, indicates the proportion of actual positives (females) that are correctly identified by the model. It is crucial for understanding how well the model can detect females.\n\nSpecificity, or the true negative rate, represents the proportion of actual negatives (males) that are correctly identified. This metric is important for assessing the model's ability to correctly identify males.\n\nThe F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both concerns. It is particularly useful when the class distribution is imbalanced.\n\nThe AUC is a performance measurement for classification problems at various threshold settings. It provides an aggregate measure of performance across all possible classification thresholds. An AUC of 1.0 indicates perfect classification, while an AUC of 0.5 suggests no discriminative ability.\n\nThese metrics are widely used in the literature for evaluating classification models, making our set of metrics representative and comparable to other studies in the field. Additionally, we compared our models' performance to that of human experts, providing a benchmark against traditional methods. This comprehensive evaluation ensures that our findings are robust and reliable.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we conducted a comprehensive comparison between our convolutional neural network (CNN) models and traditional methods used by human experts for sex estimation. This comparison was performed on specific regions of 3D virtual hemi-pelvis samples reconstructed from contemporary Han CT scans, including the ventral pubis (VP), dorsal pubis (DP), greater sciatic notch (GSN), pelvic inlet (PI), ischium, and acetabulum.\n\nThe CNN models demonstrated high accuracies, sensitivities, and specificities in sex estimation, which were comparable to those achieved during the internal validation procedure. This indicates the generalisability of our deep learning models to unforeseen samples without significant performance differences due to overfitting.\n\nIn contrast to the CNN models, two experienced forensic anthropologists evaluated the same samples using traditional methods. The results showed that most CNN models outperformed the human experts in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, except for the acetabulum region. The CNN models could be trained in a few hours, whereas a qualified anthropologist requires years of professional training.\n\nThe heatmap analysis based on the Guided Backpropagation algorithm revealed that the CNN models focused on anatomical structures known to contribute significantly to sexual classification. This includes traits such as the ventral arc, subpubic angle, pubis body shape, and subpubic contour on the VP and DP. The models also highlighted the importance of the obturator foramen in pelvic sex estimation.\n\nOur findings suggest that the CNN models provide a reliable and efficient alternative to traditional methods for sex estimation, particularly in cases where forensic anthropologists may not have access to regular and entire pelvis bones. The models' ability to ignore irrelevant details, such as developmental variations of marginal structures, further enhances their accuracy and reliability.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The performance metrics for the convolutional neural network (CNN) models and human experts include confidence intervals, providing a range within which the true metric value is likely to fall. For instance, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values for the CNN models range from 0.930 to 1.000, with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) indicating the reliability of these estimates.\n\nStatistical significance was assessed using the DeLong test for comparing AUC values. This test revealed that the ventral pubis (VP), dorsal pubis (DP), and pelvic inlet (PI) models yielded higher AUC values than others, with a significance level of P < 0.05. No significant differences in AUC values were found among these three models (P > 0.05), suggesting that they perform similarly in terms of sex estimation. Additionally, there was no remarkable statistical significance of AUC values between the greater sciatic notch (GSN) and ischium models (P > 0.05), both of which had higher AUC values than the acetabulum model (P < 0.05), which presented the lowest AUC value of 0.822.\n\nThe intra- and interobserver agreements for human experts were quantified using Weighted Kappa (k) for ordinal ranked data and Cohen\u2019s Kappa (k) for binary data. The agreements were substantial to almost perfect, indicating the relative reliability of sex estimation made by human experts. However, the CNN models generally outperformed human experts in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 scores, except for the acetabulum, where the performance was comparable.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics are robust, with confidence intervals providing a measure of reliability. The statistical tests confirm that the CNN models, particularly for the VP, DP, and PI, are superior to human experts and other models in sex estimation tasks.",
