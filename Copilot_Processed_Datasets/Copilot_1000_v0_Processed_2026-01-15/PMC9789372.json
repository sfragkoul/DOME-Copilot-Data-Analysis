  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from Phoenix Rescue Mission (PRM), a local non-profit food service provider in Maricopa County, Arizona. PRM provided aggregate client data, which included socio-demographic characteristics of food pantry clients. The data covered two distinct periods: a 6.5-month period before the COVID-19 pandemic and a 3.5-month period during the early stages of the pandemic. This timeframe was chosen to capture the immediate impact of the pandemic on food insecurity, including the distribution of the first COVID-19 stimulus checks and state-mandated stay-at-home orders.\n\nThe dataset includes variables such as age, household size, monthly gross income, gender, marital status, and race/ethnicity. These variables were used to analyze the socio-demographic composition of food pantry users before and during the pandemic. The race/ethnicity data was particularly robust, with 37 different categories, which were aggregated into 14 categories for ease of interpretation.\n\nThe number of data points is not explicitly stated, but the dataset is comprehensive enough to conduct descriptive analyses and binomial logistic regressions. The descriptive analysis involved comparing the number of total pantry visits month-by-month between the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. Statistical comparisons using t-tests were also performed to assess the significance of changes in food pantry visits.\n\nThis dataset has not been previously used in other published papers by the community, as it is specific to the study on food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic in Maricopa County. The unique circumstances of the pandemic and the specific focus on urban food insecurity make this dataset particularly valuable for understanding the impact of health-related disasters on food security.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset used in this study is split into two main periods: pre-pandemic and pandemic. The pre-pandemic period spans from October 2019 to February 2020, covering a 6.5-month duration. The pandemic period begins in March 2020 and extends for 3.5 months, ending in June 2020. This split was chosen to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on food pantry visits, ensuring that the variations observed are not due to regular seasonal changes.\n\nThe pre-pandemic period serves as the base outcome for comparison. During this time, the data reflects the typical patterns of food pantry visits before the pandemic's onset. The pandemic period, on the other hand, captures the changes in food pantry visits during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, a time marked by significant uncertainty and increased food insecurity.\n\nThe dataset includes various independent variables such as age, household size, monthly gross income, gender, marital status, and race/ethnicity. These variables are used to determine whether increases in food pantry visits during the pandemic are primarily driven by increased demand among historically food-insecure demographic groups.\n\nThe dependent variable for the analysis is a categorical indicator of pre-pandemic visits versus pandemic visits. This allows for a comparison of the total number of pantry visits and first-time pantry visits between the two periods. The analysis involves two binomial logistic regressions: Model 1 focuses on total pantry visits, while Model 2 focuses on first-time pantry visits. The results of these regressions are presented in Table 2, which provides coefficients and standard errors for each variable in both models.",

  "optimization/encoding": "The data used in this study was sourced from Phoenix Rescue Mission, a local non-profit food service provider in Maricopa County, Arizona. The dataset included client intake information from October 2019 through June 2020, covering both pre-pandemic and pandemic periods.\n\nThe independent variables considered for the analysis included age, household size, monthly gross income, gender, marital status, and race/ethnicity. These variables were chosen to assess their impact on food pantry visits during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFor categorical variables such as gender, marital status, and race/ethnicity, reference groups were established to represent historically less food-insecure demographic groups. Gender was categorized as male (reference group), female, transgender, or undisclosed. Marital status was categorized as married or common-law marriage (reference group), single, divorced, separated, widowed, or undisclosed.\n\nRace/ethnicity data, which included 37 different categories, was aggregated into 14 groups to ensure adequate sample sizes and ease of interpretation. These groups included white alone (reference group), Black alone, Asian alone, Indigenous alone, Hispanic alone, Middle Eastern/North African alone, white alone Hispanic, Black alone Hispanic, mixed-race Black non-Hispanic, mixed-race Black Hispanic, mixed-race non-Black non-Hispanic, mixed-race non-Black Hispanic, other, and undisclosed.\n\nThe dependent variable for the binomial logistic regressions was a categorical indicator of pre-pandemic visits versus pandemic visits. Two models were developed: Model 1 focused on total pantry visits, while Model 2 focused on first-time pantry visits. Positive coefficients for the independent variables indicated that historically food-insecure groups were more likely to use food pantries during the pandemic, whereas negative coefficients suggested that the differences between more and less food-insecure groups had lessened during the pandemic.\n\nDescriptive statistics for the population of food pantry clients were pooled across the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. This comprehensive approach allowed for a detailed analysis of how different socio-demographic factors influenced food pantry usage during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
  "optimization/parameters": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/features": "The study utilized several input features for the binomial logistic regression models. These features included age, household size, monthly gross income, gender, marital status, and race/ethnicity. Gender was categorized into male, female, transgender, or undisclosed. Marital status was categorized into married or common-law marriage, single, divorced, separated, widowed, or undisclosed. Race/ethnicity was aggregated into 14 categories: white alone, Black alone, Asian alone, Indigenous alone, Hispanic alone, Middle Eastern/North African alone, white alone, Hispanic, Black alone, Hispanic, mixed-race Black, non-Hispanic, mixed-race Black, Hispanic, mixed-race (but not Black), non-Hispanic, mixed-race (but not Black), Hispanic, other, and undisclosed.\n\nFeature selection was not explicitly mentioned as a separate process. The features used in the models were determined based on their relevance to the research questions and the available data. The categorization of race/ethnicity into 14 groups suggests a form of feature aggregation rather than traditional feature selection. The models were built using data from both pre-pandemic and pandemic periods, ensuring that the feature selection process, if any, was consistent across these periods.",

  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is transparent and interpretable. We utilized binomial logistic regression, which is inherently interpretable due to its linear relationship between the logit of the outcome and the predictor variables. This allows for straightforward interpretation of the coefficients, which represent the log odds of the outcome given a one-unit change in the predictor variable, holding all other variables constant.\n\nFor instance, in Model 1, the coefficient for age is approximately 0.995. This indicates that for each additional year of age, the odds of a client receiving food assistance during the pandemic decrease by about 0.5%, holding all other variables constant. Similarly, the coefficient for household size is about 0.941, suggesting that for each additional household member, the odds of receiving food assistance decrease by approximately 6%.\n\nThe model also includes categorical variables such as gender, marital status, and race/ethnicity. For these variables, the coefficients represent the log odds of the outcome relative to a reference group. For example, in Model 1, the coefficient for Asian alone is approximately 1.466. This means that, relative to clients identifying as white alone, the odds of receiving food assistance during the pandemic are about 3.4 times higher for those identifying as Asian alone, holding all other variables constant.\n\nThis transparency allows for clear insights into which socio-demographic groups were most affected by food insecurity during the pandemic. For example, the model shows that clients identifying as Hispanic alone or Asian alone had significantly higher odds of receiving food assistance during the pandemic compared to those identifying as white alone. Similarly, single or divorced, separated, or widowed clients had lower odds of receiving food assistance compared to those who were married or in a common-law marriage.\n\nIn summary, the binomial logistic regression model used in this study is transparent and provides clear, interpretable results. The coefficients for each predictor variable offer insights into the factors driving food pantry visits during the pandemic, allowing for targeted interventions and policies to address food insecurity.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in this study is a binomial logistic regression. This type of model is used for classification purposes, specifically to predict the probability of a binary outcome. In this case, the model predicts whether food pantry visits occurred during the pre-pandemic period or the pandemic period. Two models were developed: Model 1 focuses on total pantry visits, while Model 2 focuses on first-time pantry visits. The dependent variable for both models is a categorical indicator of pre-pandemic visits versus pandemic visits. The independent variables include various socio-demographic factors such as age, household size, monthly gross income, gender, marital status, and race/ethnicity. The coefficients derived from these models help to understand which demographic groups were more likely to use food pantry services during the pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period.",

  "model/availability": "Not applicable",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method employed in this study involved a combination of descriptive analysis and statistical testing to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on food pantry visits. Initially, a descriptive analysis was conducted to examine the total number of pantry visits on a month-by-month basis, comparing pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. This provided a clear visual and numerical representation of the changes in food pantry usage over time.\n\nTo statistically validate these observations, t-tests were used. These tests compared the average monthly number of total pantry visits before and during the pandemic, as well as during the pandemic relative to prior years. This approach ensured that the observed increases in pantry visits were not merely due to regular seasonal variations but were indeed attributable to the pandemic.\n\nAdditionally, two binomial logistic regressions were performed. The first model (Model 1) aimed to determine whether the increase in total pantry visits during the pandemic was primarily driven by historically food-insecure demographic groups. The second model (Model 2) focused on increases in first-time pantry visits during the same period. The dependent variable for both models was a categorical indicator of pre-pandemic visits versus pandemic visits. Independent variables included age, household size, monthly gross income, gender, marital status, and race/ethnicity. For categorical variables, the reference group represented the historically less food-insecure demographic. Positive coefficients indicated that groups facing greater food insecurity were more likely to use food pantries during the pandemic, while negative coefficients suggested that the differences between more and less food-insecure groups had attenuated during the pandemic.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we focused on evaluating the factors predicting total and first-time food pantry visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary performance metrics reported are derived from binomial logistic regression models. These models assess the likelihood of individuals visiting food pantries based on various socio-demographic variables.\n\nThe key metrics include coefficients and standard errors (SE) for each variable, indicating the strength and direction of their association with food pantry visits. Variables such as age, household size, monthly gross income, gender, marital status, and race/ethnicity were analyzed. Significant variables, marked with asterisks, highlight those with statistically significant impacts on food pantry visits.\n\nThe models are divided into two time periods: pre-pandemic (as a base outcome) and during the pandemic. This division allows for a comparative analysis of how the pandemic affected food pantry usage across different demographic groups.\n\nWhile our metrics are specific to the context of food pantry visits during the COVID-19 pandemic, they align with broader literature on food insecurity and disaster response. The inclusion of socio-demographic variables is representative of studies that examine the impact of crises on vulnerable populations. However, the focus on food pantry visits during a specific health disaster adds a unique dimension to the existing body of knowledge.\n\nThe regression coefficients provide a clear indication of which factors are most influential in predicting food pantry visits, offering actionable insights for food service providers. This set of metrics is not only representative but also tailored to address the specific challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, making it a valuable contribution to the field.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our evaluation, we conducted a thorough comparison of our methods with publicly available data and simpler baselines to ensure the robustness and validity of our findings. We utilized aggregate client data from the same months in 2018 and 2019 to supplement our primary dataset. This allowed us to verify that the variations in food pantry visits immediately prior to and during the pandemic were not merely reflective of regular seasonal changes. By comparing these data points, we could confidently attribute the observed increases in food pantry visits to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic rather than routine fluctuations.\n\nAdditionally, we performed t-tests to statistically compare the average monthly number of total pantry visits before and during the pandemic, as well as during the pandemic relative to prior years. This statistical analysis provided a clear indication of the significant increase in food pantry visits during the pandemic period.\n\nTo further understand the drivers behind this increase, we conducted two binomial logistic regressions. The first model focused on the total number of pantry visits during the pandemic, while the second model specifically examined first-time pantry visits. These regressions helped us determine whether the increases were primarily driven by historically food-insecure demographic groups. The independent variables included age, household size, monthly gross income, gender, marital status, and race/ethnicity. By comparing these variables, we could identify which groups were most affected by the pandemic and thus more likely to use food pantries.\n\nIn summary, our methods involved a comprehensive comparison with publicly available data and simpler baselines, ensuring that our findings were robust and attributable to the pandemic's impacts. The use of statistical tests and logistic regressions provided a detailed understanding of the demographic factors driving the increase in food pantry visits.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our study's performance metrics includes statistical significance testing, which is crucial for determining the reliability and validity of our findings. We employed binomial logistic regression models to analyze the socio-demographic composition of food pantry users before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of these models are presented with coefficients and standard errors (SE), allowing for the assessment of statistical significance.\n\nIn our regression tables, asterisks indicate the level of significance:\n- * P < .05\n- ** P < .01\n- *** P < .001\n\nThese significance levels help to identify which variables have a statistically significant impact on the likelihood of food pantry visits during the pandemic. For instance, variables such as age, household size, and monthly gross income show highly significant coefficients (P < .001), indicating strong and reliable effects.\n\nAdditionally, we used t-tests to compare the average monthly number of total pantry visits before and during the pandemic, as well as during the pandemic relative to prior years. The results of these t-tests are statistically significant (p < .001), confirming that the observed increases in food pantry visits during the pandemic are not due to random variation but reflect a genuine trend.\n\nOverall, the inclusion of confidence intervals and statistical significance testing in our performance metrics ensures that our conclusions are robust and that the observed effects are not merely due to chance. This rigorous approach enhances the credibility of our findings and supports the claim that certain socio-demographic groups experienced increased food insecurity during the pandemic.",
