  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in this study leverages a combination of machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model for graft loss after kidney transplantation. The primary machine-learning algorithm class used is ensemble learning, specifically focusing on survival analysis. The algorithms integrated include LASSO, CoxBoost, Elastic Net, Random Survival Forest (RSF), Stepwise Cox, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Ridge, Super Partial Correlation (SuperPC), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and Partial Least Squares with Cox regression (plsRcox). These algorithms were chosen for their robustness and efficacy in handling complex datasets and predicting survival outcomes.\n\nThe combination of RSF and Ridge algorithms exhibited optimal performance in constructing the predictive model, named PCDI.

This approach is particularly valuable in the context of kidney transplantation, where the heterogeneity of ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) pathophysiology necessitates a comprehensive and nuanced predictive model.\n\nThe algorithms used are well-established in the field of machine learning and survival analysis, and their application in this study is novel in the context of predicting graft loss after kidney transplantation. The focus of this research is on the clinical application and validation of these algorithms rather than the development of new machine-learning techniques. Therefore, the algorithms were not published in a machine-learning journal but rather in a clinical research journal, highlighting their practical utility in medical research.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model developed in this study is indeed a meta-predictor, leveraging data from multiple machine-learning algorithms to enhance its predictive power. The process involved integrating 101 unique combinations from ten diverse machine learning algorithms. These algorithms included LASSO, CoxBoost, Elastic Net, Random Survival Forest (RSF), Stepwise Cox, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Ridge, Super Partial Correlation (SuperPC), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and Partial Least Squares with Cox regression (plsRcox). Among these combinations, the integration of RSF and Ridge algorithms demonstrated optimal performance, leading to the development of the PCDI model.\n\nThe training data used for these algorithms was derived from eight GEO datasets, which included biopsied transplanted kidney tissues. These datasets were merged and underwent batch correction to ensure consistency. The datasets used for validation were distinct from the training data, ensuring that the training data was independent. This independence is crucial for validating the model's robustness and generalizability.\n\nThe PCDI model was validated using a single PCD pattern set and four external sets, ensuring that the model's performance was assessed across different datasets. This validation process included categorizing patients into high-risk and low-risk groups based on the PCDI score and evaluating prognostic differences using Kaplan-Meier curves. Additionally, ROC curves were generated to assess the model's prognostic efficacy, further confirming its reliability.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure the quality and compatibility of the datasets. Initially, gene expression data and clinical information were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, comprising eight datasets of biopsied transplanted kidney samples. These datasets underwent data filtering, background correction, quality control, and log2 transformation. Normalization was then conducted using the \"normalizeBetweenArrays\" function in the \"limma\" R package. To address batch effects, the datasets were merged and batch correction was applied using the Combat method from the \"sva\" R package.\n\nFor the analysis, 1,548 PCD-related genes were gathered from literature research, covering 18 different PCD patterns. These genes were used to conduct consensus clustering analysis, which classified the transplanted kidney samples into distinct subtypes. The optimal number of clusters was determined by running the algorithm with k values ranging from 2 to 10 and selecting the best consensus among the items in each cluster. Principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to visualize the clustering patterns of the samples.\n\nGene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) was performed using the \"GSVA\" R package to estimate the score attributed to each PCD pattern and metabolism signature based on transcriptomic data. This unsupervised and nonparametric approach allowed for the calculation of gene set scores for each sample, corresponding to the 18 PCD patterns and 84 metabolism signatures.\n\nAdditionally, various bioinformatic algorithms, including ESTIMATE, CIBERSORT, Xcell, MCPcounter, Quantiseq, and EPIC, were used to assess the degree of immunological infiltration. These algorithms estimated the abundance of different immune cell subpopulations, providing a comprehensive evaluation of immune infiltration in the kidney allografts. The relative abundance of immune and stromal cells was quantified, and the significance of differences in immune infiltration was determined using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Heatmap and boxplot analyses were utilized to visually represent the immune cell proportions in the kidney allografts with significant enrichment.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized a combination of machine learning algorithms to develop a predictive model for graft loss in kidney transplantation. The model, named PCDI, was constructed using the combination of Random Survival Forest (RSF) and Ridge algorithms. These algorithms were selected from a pool of ten diverse machine learning methods, including LASSO, CoxBoost, Elastic Net, Stepwise Cox, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Super Partial Correlation (SuperPC), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and Partial Least Squares with Cox regression (plsRcox).\n\nThe number of parameters (p) used in the model was determined through a comprehensive feature selection process. Initially, prognosis-associated genes in 18 programmed cell death (PCD) patterns were screened using univariate Cox regression. This step identified genes with a hazard ratio (HR) not equal to 1 and a p-value less than 0.05. Subsequently, candidate genes were further refined using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression feature selection and multivariate Cox regression. This process ensured that only the most relevant genes were included in the final model.\n\nThe final model incorporated 39 genes derived from the 18 PCD patterns, which were identified as risk genes linked to graft function loss. These genes were considered suitable for prognostic model development. The risk score for each recipient was calculated using a linear combination of the regression coefficients and the expression of these candidate genes. This approach allowed for the division of patients into high- and low-risk groups based on their risk scores.\n\nThe selection of the optimal number of parameters was validated through the use of multiple datasets, including the GSE21374 dataset with long-term follow-up. The model's efficacy was further confirmed by comparing it with four published prediction models and any risk model constructed by each PCD pattern. The results demonstrated that the PCDI model had the best efficacy in predicting graft loss after kidney transplantation.",
  "optimization/features": "The input features for the predictive model were derived from a comprehensive analysis of programmed cell death (PCD)-related genes. Initially, 1,964 PCD-related genes were gathered, covering various cell death patterns such as apoptosis, autophagy, ferroptosis, and others. After removing duplicates, 1,548 unique PCD-related genes were used for the analysis.\n\nFeature selection was performed using multiple methods to ensure the robustness and relevance of the selected genes. Univariate Cox regression analysis was first employed to screen prognosis-associated genes, focusing on those with a hazard ratio not equal to 1 and a p-value less than 0.05. This step was crucial in identifying genes significantly associated with graft prognosis.\n\nSubsequently, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and multivariate Cox regression were used to further refine the candidate genes. These methods helped in selecting the most relevant features by reducing overfitting and enhancing the model's predictive power.\n\nThe final set of features used in the predictive model consisted of 39 genes derived from the 18 cell death patterns. These genes were identified as risk genes linked to graft function loss and were considered suitable for prognostic model development. The feature selection process was conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the model's performance was not biased by the test data.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The study employed a robust approach to ensure that the predictive model was neither overfitted nor underfitted. Initially, the number of parameters was indeed larger than the number of training points, which is a common scenario in high-dimensional genomic data. To address this, several regularization techniques were utilized, including LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) and Ridge regression. These methods impose penalties on the regression coefficients, effectively reducing the complexity of the model and preventing overfitting.\n\nAdditionally, the study integrated multiple machine learning algorithms, including Random Survival Forest (RSF) and Ridge, to develop the PCD Index (PCDI). The combination of these algorithms helped to enhance the model's robustness and generalizability. The model's performance was validated using both single PCD pattern sets and four external datasets, ensuring that it could generalize well to new, unseen data.\n\nTo further validate the model, Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves and time-dependent Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were used. The K-M curves demonstrated significant prognostic differences between high-risk and low-risk groups, while the ROC curves showed high area under the curve (AUC) values, indicating good sensitivity and specificity. These validation steps helped to rule out underfitting by ensuring that the model could capture the underlying patterns in the data.\n\nMoreover, the study employed cross-validation techniques to assess the model's performance. This involved splitting the data into training and testing sets multiple times and evaluating the model's performance across these splits. This approach helped to ensure that the model's performance was consistent and not due to chance.\n\nIn summary, the study used a combination of regularization techniques, multiple machine learning algorithms, extensive validation with external datasets, and cross-validation to address the challenges of overfitting and underfitting. These measures ensured that the predictive model was robust, generalizable, and capable of accurately predicting graft loss after kidney transplantation.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several regularization methods to prevent overfitting and enhance the robustness of our predictive models. Specifically, we utilized the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, which is a type of regularization that adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients. This technique helps in reducing the complexity of the model by shrinking some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n\nAdditionally, we incorporated the Ridge regression, which adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients. This method helps in reducing the complexity of the model by shrinking the coefficients, but it does not set them to zero.\n\nFurthermore, we used the Elastic Net, which combines the penalties of both LASSO and Ridge regressions. This approach provides a balance between the two methods, allowing for both feature selection and coefficient shrinkage.\n\nThese regularization techniques were integral to our machine learning workflow, ensuring that our models were not only accurate but also generalizable to new, unseen data. By integrating these methods, we aimed to mitigate the risk of overfitting and enhance the reliability of our predictive model for graft loss after kidney transplantation.",

  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in this study is not a blackbox. It is designed to be interpretable and transparent, providing clear insights into the factors influencing graft loss after kidney transplantation.\n\nThe model is constructed using a combination of Random Survival Forest (RSF) and Ridge algorithms, which are both interpretable methods. The RSF algorithm provides a way to understand the importance of each gene in predicting graft loss, while the Ridge algorithm helps in regularizing the coefficients, making the model more interpretable by reducing the complexity.\n\nOne of the key aspects of the model's transparency is the use of 39 hub genes derived from 18 programmed cell death (PCD) patterns. These genes were identified through a rigorous process involving univariate Cox regression, LASSO regression, and multivariate Cox regression. The forest plots generated using the \"forestplot\" package in R visualize the significant prognostic linkage of these genes to graft loss, indicated by their hazard ratio values. This allows clinicians and researchers to understand which specific genes are most influential in predicting graft outcomes.\n\nAdditionally, the model divides patients into high-risk and low-risk groups based on their risk scores, which are calculated using a linear combination of the regression coefficients and the expression of candidate genes. This risk stratification provides a clear and actionable way to identify patients who are at higher risk of graft loss, enabling timely intervention and personalized treatment strategies.\n\nThe model's performance is validated using the GSE21374 dataset with long-term follow-up, demonstrating its efficacy in predicting graft loss. The Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves and time-dependent Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves further illustrate the model's ability to distinguish between high-risk and low-risk patients, providing a transparent and interpretable measure of its predictive power.\n\nIn summary, the model is designed to be transparent and interpretable, with clear visualizations and risk stratification that provide actionable insights for clinicians and researchers. The use of interpretable machine learning algorithms and the focus on specific PCD-related genes ensure that the model's predictions are understandable and clinically relevant.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is primarily a regression model, specifically designed for predicting the risk of graft loss after kidney transplantation. It utilizes a combination of machine learning algorithms, including Random Survival Forest (RSF) and Ridge regression, to generate a risk score known as PCDI (Programmed Cell Death Index). This risk score is used to classify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups based on their likelihood of experiencing graft loss. The model's efficacy was validated using Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, demonstrating its ability to predict long-term graft survival with high sensitivity and specificity.

  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our predictive model, we employed several performance metrics to ensure a comprehensive assessment of its efficacy. The primary metric used was the Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curve, which allowed us to visualize and compare the survival distributions between high-risk and low-risk groups. This method is widely accepted in survival analysis and provides a clear graphical representation of the prognostic differences.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to evaluate the model's sensitivity and specificity over different time points. The area under the curve (AUC) values at 0.5-, 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-year intervals were reported, demonstrating the model's robustness in predicting graft loss over time. These AUC values are crucial for understanding the model's performance at various stages post-transplantation.\n\nThe Kruskal-Wallis test was employed to determine the significance of differences in immune infiltration among the identified subtypes.
