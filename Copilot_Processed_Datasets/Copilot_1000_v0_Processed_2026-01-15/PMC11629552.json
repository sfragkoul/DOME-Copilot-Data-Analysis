  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study is sourced from the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA), a comprehensive gene expression atlas developed by the Allen Institute for Brain Sciences. This atlas includes normalized microarray gene expression data from post-mortem brain tissue samples of six donors who died from non-neurological diseases. The donors were aged between 18 and 68 years, with no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders, substance abuse, or severe ischemic-hypoxic encephalopathy. The tissue samples were taken bilaterally from two donors and from the left cerebral hemisphere of four donors, resulting in a total of 3,695 matched brain tissue samples. These samples were processed and mapped onto the Conte 69 atlas using the Human Connectome Workbench software.\n\nThe AHBA data underwent rigorous quality control and preprocessing, including probe to gene annotation, probe cleaning, and selection steps. This process ensured that the data were normalized to superimpose group-level effects and reduce individual variation. The dataset has been utilized in various studies within the scientific community, making it a reliable and well-established resource for gene expression analysis.\n\nThe study also involved functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 58 participants, including 30 healthy controls and 28 patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC). The fMRI data were preprocessed using the DPABI V7.0 toolbox, which included steps such as conversion to NIFTI format, slice timing correction, realignment for head motion, segmentation, normalization, linear detrending, bandpass filtering, and spatial smoothing. This preprocessing pipeline ensured the data's quality and consistency, enabling robust analysis of spontaneous brain activity in DOC patients compared to healthy controls.",

  "dataset/availability": "The datasets generated during this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. This approach ensures that the data can be accessed by other researchers for verification or further study while maintaining control over the distribution and use of the data. The datasets are not publicly released in a forum, but the corresponding author can provide them upon request, which helps in managing the data sharing process and ensuring that the data is used appropriately.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in this study is the Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM). This is a well-established supervised learning method based on classification. The primary goal of LSVM is to construct a boundary within the dataset to effectively separate different categories of data. This algorithm has been chosen for its demonstrated performance and computational efficiency, which are superior to traditional classification methods.\n\nThe LSVM used in this study is not a new algorithm. It is a widely recognized and utilized technique in the field of machine learning. The decision to use LSVM in this context was driven by its proven effectiveness in handling classification tasks, particularly in scenarios involving medical data and prognostic predictions. The algorithm's ability to provide robust and reliable results makes it a suitable choice for validating the prediction models developed in this research.\n\nThe LSVM was implemented using the machine learning platform in Matlab 2016b. This platform offers a comprehensive environment for developing and testing machine learning models, ensuring that the algorithm's performance can be accurately assessed and validated. The use of Matlab 2016b facilitated the integration of LSVM with other analytical tools and datasets, enabling a seamless workflow for the study's objectives.\n\nThe choice of publishing this work in a clinical and health psychology journal rather than a machine-learning journal is justified by the focus of the study. The primary aim of this research is to explore the differences in brain activity in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) following severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) and to develop predictive models for their prognosis. The application of LSVM in this context is a means to an end, rather than the end itself. The study's contributions lie in the clinical insights and prognostic tools derived from the analysis, which are of direct relevance to the fields of clinical and health psychology.",
  "optimization/meta": "The study employed a meta-predictor approach to enhance the robustness of the prediction model for patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC). This meta-predictor utilized data from multiple machine-learning algorithms as input. Specifically, the Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM) was used to identify the prognosis of patients based on the mean fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (mfALFF) values of the regions of interest (ROI). The LSVM demonstrated a positive predictive value of 80% for forecasting awakening within six months and 83% for predicting the presence of DOC.\n\nThe meta-predictor approach involved combining the predictions from the Nomogram model, established using binary Logistic regression, and the LSVM model. The Nomogram model, based on the mfALFF values of ROI, showed a stable prediction ability with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.90. The LSVM model, also based on the mfALFF values of ROI, similarly exhibited an AUC of 0.90, indicating high prognostic discrimination ability.\n\nIt is important to note that the training data for these models were derived from independent sources. The study included a total of 58 participants, with 28 DOC patients and 30 healthy controls. The DOC patients were further divided into wake and DOC groups based on their 6-month prognosis. This division ensured that the training data for the models were independent, enhancing the reliability of the predictions.\n\nIn summary, the meta-predictor approach in this study integrated predictions from both the Nomogram model and the LSVM model, utilizing mfALFF values of ROI. The independence of the training data was maintained, ensuring robust and reliable prognostic predictions for DOC patients.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps. Initially, genetic data were normalized to superimpose group-level effects and reduce individual variation. This process helped in standardizing the data across different samples.\n\nA spherical region of interest (ROI) with a 6 mm radius was constructed for each of the tissue samples using their Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) center-of-mass coordinates as the origin. This allowed for precise localization of the brain regions of interest.\n\nThe Human Connectome Workbench software was then used to map these data onto the Conte 69 atlas, which provided a detailed anatomical framework for the analysis. This step ensured that the data were accurately aligned with known brain structures.\n\nMore than half of the voxels in the whole brain tissue mask were represented in the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) samples. This comprehensive coverage allowed for a detailed comparison of abnormal brain regions in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) versus healthy controls.\n\nA permutation test was used to detect significant differences in gene expression between the abnormal brain regions and randomly sampled specimens. This involved 10,000 replicates and a significance threshold of P < 0.001, ensuring robust statistical validation.\n\nFor the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, preprocessing was performed using the DPABI V7.0 toolbox in Matlab 2016b. The pipeline included converting DICOM data to NIFTI format, removing the first 10 volumes to allow for magnetization equilibrium, and performing slice timing correction to align the timing of slice acquisition.\n\nHead motion correction was applied, excluding participants with any translation greater than 2.0 mm or rotation greater than 2 degrees. The structural image was segmented into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid, and then normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute standard space with a reslice resolution of 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 mm.\n\nLinear detrending was performed to remove potential drift in the image signal intensity, followed by bandpass filtering within the frequency range of 0.01-0.08 Hz. The Friston 24 parameter head motion model was applied to regress out remaining noise due to head motion and nuisance signals from cerebrospinal fluid and white matter.\n\nSpatial smoothing was performed with a Gaussian kernel of 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 mm\u00b3 to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio. The time series of each voxel was transformed to the frequency domain, and the power spectrum was obtained. The averaged square root of the power spectrum within the 0.01-0.08 Hz frequency band was retained as the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF).\n\nThe fractional ALFF (fALFF) was defined as the ratio of the power of each frequency in the low-frequency range to that of the entire detectable frequency range. For standardization, the mean fALFF maps were obtained by dividing the fALFF by the global voxel-wise value in the individual entire brain volume.\n\nA two-sample t-test with covariate adjustment (ANCOVA) was used to compare the differences in whole-brain mean fALFF between patients with DOC and healthy controls, as well as between the wake and DOC groups. Covariates included cerebrospinal fluid, white matter, head motion coefficient, age, and gender.\n\nMultiple comparison correction was conducted using the False Discovery Rate (FDR) with a threshold of q < 0.001 or AlphaSim with a threshold of P < 0.05 and clusters greater than 154. This ensured that the results were statistically significant and not due to chance.\n\nThe peak coordinates of the differential brain regions between patients and healthy controls were used to extract corresponding clusters as regions of interest (ROIs). These ROIs were then analyzed for their topological properties, including degree centrality and node efficiency, using the Gretna software. This comprehensive preprocessing and encoding pipeline ensured that the data were accurately prepared for subsequent machine-learning analyses.",
  "optimization/parameters": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/features": "The study utilized the mean fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (mfALFF) values corresponding to regions of interest (ROI) in different prognostic groups as input features. These mfALFF values were derived from various brain regions, including those with enhanced and weakened activity in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) compared to healthy controls.\n\nFeature selection was performed to identify the most relevant brain regions for predicting prognosis. This selection process was conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the model's performance on the test set remained unbiased. The specific regions identified included the cerebellar tonsil, cerebellum posterior and anterior lobes, brainstem, thalamus, globus pallidus, limbic lobe, insula, and paracentral lobule, among others. These regions were chosen based on their significant differences in mfALFF values between DOC patients and healthy controls, as well as their overlap with the Ascending Reticular Activating System (ARAS), which is crucial for consciousness regulation.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The study employed several statistical and machine learning methods to analyze the data, ensuring that both overfitting and underfitting were addressed appropriately.\n\nThe number of parameters in the models used, such as the Nomogram prediction model and the Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM), was managed carefully to avoid overfitting. For the Nomogram model, the 'rms' package in R was utilized, which includes built-in mechanisms for regularization and cross-validation. This helps in preventing the model from becoming too complex and fitting the noise in the training data. Additionally, the model's performance was validated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, which provided an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.90, indicating strong predictive capability without overfitting.\n\nFor the LSVM analysis, a 2-fold crossover validation was implemented. This technique splits the data into two subsets, training the model on one subset and validating it on the other, and then reversing the roles. This process helps in assessing the model's generalization ability and ensures that it performs well on unseen data, thus ruling out overfitting.\n\nTo address underfitting, the study ensured that the models were complex enough to capture the underlying patterns in the data. The LSVM, known for its high computational efficiency and better performance compared to traditional classification methods, was chosen for its ability to construct an effective boundary in the dataset to separate different categories of data. The use of mfALFF values corresponding to regions of interest (ROIs) in different prognostic groups provided a rich feature set, reducing the risk of underfitting.\n\nMoreover, the study included a robust statistical analysis pipeline using SPSS and GraphPad Prism, which involved Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for normality and appropriate statistical tests for different types of variables. This thorough approach ensured that the models were neither too simple nor too complex, striking a balance that minimized both overfitting and underfitting.",
  "optimization/regularization": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/config": "Not applicable.",
  "model/interpretability": "The models employed in this study, specifically the Nomogram prediction model and the Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM), offer varying degrees of interpretability. The Nomogram model, established using binary logistic regression, is relatively transparent. This model provides a clear visual representation of the relationship between the mean fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (mfALFF) values of the regions of interest (ROI) and the prognosis of disorders of consciousness (DOC) patients. The Nomogram allows clinicians to easily interpret the contribution of each variable to the final prediction, making it a valuable tool for clinical decision-making.\n\nOn the other hand, the LSVM model, while highly effective in predicting outcomes, is somewhat of a black box. LSVM is a supervised learning method that constructs a boundary in the dataset to separate different categories of data. Although it has demonstrated excellent performance with a positive predictive value of 80% for forecasting awakening within six months and 83% for forecasting the presence of DOC, the internal workings of how it arrives at these predictions are not as straightforward to interpret. However, the use of a 2-fold crossover analysis helps to validate the robustness and reliability of the LSVM model's predictions.\n\nIn summary, the Nomogram model offers clear interpretability, making it a transparent tool for clinicians, while the LSVM model, though highly accurate, operates with less transparency. The combination of these models provides a comprehensive approach to predicting the prognosis of DOC patients, leveraging both interpretability and high predictive accuracy.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is primarily a classification model. It utilizes the Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM) for predicting the prognosis of patients with Disorders of Consciousness (DOC) based on the mean fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (mfALFF) values of regions of interest (ROI). The LSVM is a supervised learning method designed for classification tasks, aiming to construct a boundary in the dataset to separate different categories of data. This model was implemented using a 2-fold crossover analysis in Matlab 2016b. Additionally, a Nomogram prediction model was established using binary logistic regression, which is also a classification technique. The Nomogram model was validated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses, further confirming its classification capabilities. The positive predictive values for wake and DOC states were 80% and 83%, respectively, indicating the model's effectiveness in classifying patient outcomes.",

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the methods employed in this study involved several rigorous statistical and machine learning techniques to ensure the robustness and validity of the findings.\n\nInitially, the normality of the distribution for each continuous variable was assessed. For normally distributed data, inter-group comparisons were performed using a two-sample t-test, while the Mann-Whitney U test was used for non-normally distributed data. Categorical variables were analyzed using the Chi-square test.\n\nUnivariate binary logistic regression analysis was conducted based on the mean fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (mfALFF) values corresponding to regions of interest (ROI) in different prognostic groups. This analysis was performed using R 4.0. The Nomogram prediction model was implemented using the 'rms' package in R 4.0. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed using the 'rms' and 'pROC' packages to validate and test the discrimination capability of the model. An area under the curve (AUC) of 0.5 indicates random outcome, while an AUC of 1 represents perfect discriminative capability.\n\nTo further validate the robustness of ROI in predicting the prognosis of disorders of consciousness (DOC) patients, a Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM) analysis with 2-fold cross-validation was implemented using Matlab 2016b.

The baseline characteristics of the participants were detailed, and statistical comparisons were made between the groups. The mfALFF values of different brain regions in DOC patients were compared to those in healthy controls, revealing regions with enhanced and weakened mfALFF. These findings were corroborated with gene enrichment results and functional decoding analysis using Neurosynth.\n\nThe Nomogram prediction model and the LSVM model both demonstrated stable and high prognostic discrimination ability. The AUC for both models was 0.90, indicating strong predictive performance. The positive predictive value of LSVM for predicting wakefulness at 6 months was 80%, and for DOC, it was 83%. These results highlight the effectiveness of the methods used in predicting the prognosis of DOC patients based on brain activity measurements.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed several performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of our models and analyses. For the Nomogram prediction model, we used receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analyses to validate and test discrimination. The area under the curve (AUC) was a key metric, where an AUC of 0.5 indicates random outcome, and an AUC of 1 represents perfect discriminative capability.\n\nFor the Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM) analysis, we utilized a 2-fold crossover method to validate the robustness of the regions of interest (ROI) in predicting the prognosis of disorders of consciousness (DOC) patients. The LSVM is a supervised learning method focused on constructing boundaries in the dataset to separate different categories of data, and it has been shown to have better performance and higher computational efficiency compared to traditional classification methods.\n\nAdditionally, we calculated topological properties such as degree centrality (DC) and node efficiency (Ne) for the ROI-ROI brain network functional connectivity (FC) matrix. The area under the curve (AUC) corresponding to these metrics at all sparsity levels was used for intergroup comparisons, with False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction applied for statistical significance.\n\nThese metrics are representative of those commonly used in the literature for evaluating predictive models and brain connectivity analyses. The ROC curve and AUC are standard measures for assessing the performance of classification models, while the topological properties provide insights into the structural and functional organization of the brain. The use of LSVM and its validation through crossover methods ensures the robustness and reliability of our findings.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we employed several statistical and machine learning methods to analyze and validate our findings. For continuous variables, we used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to examine the normality of the distribution. If the distribution was normal, we performed inter-group comparisons using a two-sample t-test, reporting the mean and standard deviation. For non-normal distributions, we used the Mann-Whitney U test, reporting the median and quartiles. Categorical variables were compared using the Chi-square test.\n\nFor more advanced analyses, we utilized specific packages in R 4.0. Univariate binary logistic regression was performed using the mfALFF values corresponding to regions of interest (ROI) in different prognostic groups.

We did not perform a direct comparison to publicly available methods on benchmark datasets, but we used established statistical and machine learning approaches to validate our results. Simpler baselines were not explicitly compared, as our focus was on using well-established methods to analyze and interpret our data.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our study's performance metrics included several statistical analyses to ensure robustness and significance. For continuous variables, normality tests were conducted, and appropriate statistical tests were applied based on the distribution.
