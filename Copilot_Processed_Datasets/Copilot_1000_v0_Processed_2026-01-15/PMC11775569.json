  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study is known as PLEASE, which stands for Patient-Level ADRs Prediction Dataset. The primary source of the adverse event reports for this dataset is the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). FAERS is a pivotal platform for post-marketing pharmacovigilance, providing a vast amount of data on adverse drug reactions.\n\nThe dataset encompasses a total of 10,443,476 reports, documenting 19,193 distinct adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with 3,624 unique drugs. These reports span the period from January 2013 to September 2022. The data includes vital demographic information such as age and gender (without any personal identifiers), records of drug substances, and descriptions of ADRs, categorized as preferred terms following the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).\n\nTo enhance the utility of this data, adverse event descriptors were meticulously linked to their respective MedDRA ID preferred terms and further mapped to human organ systems utilizing the MedDRA ontology. Similarly, drug descriptors were mapped to DrugBank IDs and categorized based on the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system.\n\nThis dataset has been curated to ensure high-quality adverse event reports through a rigorous three-stage data processing pipeline, comprising data acquisition, quality control, and consideration of drug interference. The quality control measures included retaining only the most recent reports with the same case number, focusing on ADRs occurring within the United States, concentrating on reports submitted by healthcare professionals, and ensuring that diseases, medications, and adverse event types appeared more than 100 times in the dataset. Additionally, reports with complete information on diseases, medications, and ADRs were retained to enhance the completeness and reliability of the dataset.\n\nThe dataset has been used in various studies and by the community for research purposes, contributing to the advancement of pharmacovigilance and the prediction of adverse drug reactions.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset used in this study is known as PLEASE, which stands for Patient-Level ADRs Prediction Dataset. This dataset has several variants, each with different splits for training, validation, and testing.\n\nThe original PLEASE dataset includes 279,299 patients, 889 adverse drug reactions (ADRs), and 978 drugs. It is split into three parts: 209,475 data points for training, 34,912 for validation, and 34,912 for testing.\n\nThere are also variants of the PLEASE dataset that focus on specific attributes:\n\n1. **PLEASE-Gender**: This variant includes 165,734 patients and 83 ADRs. It is split into 124,300 data points for training, 20,717 for validation, and 20,717 for testing.\n\n2. **PLEASE-Age**: This variant includes 199,413 patients and 184 ADRs. It is split into 149,559 data points for training, 24,927 for validation, and 24,927 for testing.\n\nThese splits ensure that the model can be trained, validated, and tested effectively, providing a robust framework for predicting adverse drug reactions at the patient level.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset used in this study, known as PLEASE, was curated to ensure high-quality adverse event (AE) reports. To address dataset redundancy, a rigorous three-stage data processing pipeline was established, comprising data acquisition, quality control, and consideration of drug interference.\n\nThe dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets. Specifically, the PLEASE dataset was divided into 209,475 training samples, 34,912 validation samples, and 34,912 test samples. This split ensures that the training and test sets are independent, which is crucial for evaluating the model's performance on unseen data.\n\nTo enforce independence between the training and test sets, several quality control measures were implemented. Firstly, in cases where multiple reports shared the same case number, only the most recent report was retained. This step ensures that the latest and most relevant information is used, reducing the likelihood of redundancy. Secondly, the analysis was confined to ADRs occurring within the United States, which helps to circumvent biases arising from different national surveillance systems and country-specific variations. Thirdly, the dataset focused on reports submitted by healthcare professionals, who are more likely to accurately distinguish true adverse drug reactions from indications or unrelated symptoms. Additionally, only diseases, medications, and adverse event types that appeared more than 100 times in the dataset were retained, ensuring ample historical data for robust model training and prediction. Lastly, reports that contained information on diseases, medications, and ADRs, with none of these fields being empty, were retained to enhance the completeness and reliability of the dataset.\n\nThe distribution of the PLEASE dataset compares favorably to previously published machine learning datasets in the field of pharmacovigilance. The dataset includes a vast number of reports, covering a wide range of ADRs and drugs, which provides a comprehensive basis for training and evaluating ADR prediction models. The rigorous quality control measures ensure that the dataset is reliable and representative, making it a valuable resource for advancing research in this area.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data used in this study, known as the Patient-Level ADRs Prediction Dataset (PLEASE), is not publicly released. The dataset was curated from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), which is a publicly accessible platform for post-marketing pharmacovigilance. However, the specific dataset used in this study, including the data splits for training, validation, and testing, is not made available to the public.\n\nThe data acquisition process involved obtaining raw data from FAERS, which includes demographic information, drug substances, and descriptions of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). These reports were then processed through a rigorous three-stage pipeline comprising data acquisition, quality control, and consideration of drug interference. The quality control measures ensured that the dataset was reliable and complete, with measures such as retaining only the most recent reports for cases with multiple entries and focusing on reports submitted by healthcare professionals.\n\nThe dataset was further refined by mapping adverse event descriptors to their respective MedDRA ID preferred terms and human organ systems, and drug descriptors to DrugBank IDs and ATC classifications. These mappings enhanced the utility of the data for analysis and model training.\n\nGiven the sensitive nature of the data and the need to maintain patient privacy, the dataset is not released in a public forum. The study adheres to ethical guidelines and regulatory requirements to ensure the protection of patient information. The data processing and quality control measures were enforced through a systematic approach to ensure the integrity and reliability of the dataset used in the study.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our study leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This class of machine-learning algorithms is particularly well-suited for our needs because it can effectively incorporate and utilize graph-structured data. Unlike traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), which do not inherently use graph structures, GNNs can capture complex relationships and dependencies within the data, leading to enhanced prediction capabilities.\n\nThe decision to use GNNs was driven by their demonstrated superiority over MLPs in various tasks, especially when additional information is integrated through graph structures. This approach aligns with our goal of improving the precision of Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) predictions by leveraging patient-specific attributes and medical records.\n\nRegarding the novelty of the algorithm, it is not a completely new machine-learning algorithm. Instead, it builds upon established GNN frameworks, which have been extensively studied and validated in the literature. The specific implementation and application of GNNs in the context of ADR prediction, however, represent a novel contribution. This application is tailored to address the unique challenges and requirements of ADR prediction, making it a significant advancement in the field of precision medicine.\n\nThe choice to publish this work in a broader scientific journal rather than a specialized machine-learning journal is strategic. Our focus is on the practical implications and applications of the algorithm in the medical domain. By publishing in a journal that reaches a wider audience, including clinicians, pharmacologists, and healthcare researchers, we aim to highlight the real-world impact of our work. This approach ensures that the findings are accessible to those who can directly benefit from and implement the proposed methods in clinical settings.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model described in this publication does not operate as a meta-predictor. Instead, it focuses on leveraging patient-specific data to enhance the precision of adverse drug reaction (ADR) predictions. The framework, known as PreciseADR, aggregates information from various sources, including physiological characteristics, medical histories, medication records, and ADRs. This approach ensures a comprehensive understanding of each patient's unique health profile, which is crucial for accurate ADR prediction.\n\nThe model does not rely on the outputs of other machine-learning algorithms as input. Rather, it directly utilizes a wide array of patient-specific data to improve predictive performance. This includes demographic attributes such as gender, age, and weight, as well as detailed medical histories and medication records. The emphasis on individualized risk assessments and preventative strategies reflects a holistic approach to healthcare, aiming to provide tailored interventions and early ADR detection based on patient-specific attributes and medical records.\n\nThe training data used in this model is independent and specifically curated to include relevant patient information. This ensures that the model's predictions are based on a robust and diverse dataset, which is essential for achieving superior performance in ADR prediction. The model's design and training process are carefully structured to avoid any dependencies on the outputs of other machine-learning algorithms, thereby maintaining the integrity and independence of the training data.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, data encoding and preprocessing were crucial steps to ensure the effectiveness of our machine-learning algorithm, PreciseADR. We began by aggregating heterogeneous patient data, including physiological characteristics, medical histories, medication records, and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). This data was then transformed into a structured format suitable for input into our model.\n\nWe utilized a linear transformation, referred to as M-Linear, to project node types into message vectors. This transformation was essential for integrating edge dependencies into the message representation. Specifically, we defined a matrix, WMSG, with dimensions that allowed for the integration of these dependencies. This process involved concatenating multiple message heads to form a comprehensive message vector for each node pair.\n\nFollowing this, we employed a series of Heterogeneous Graph Aggregation layers to obtain the representation of patient nodes, denoted as HL_P. To further enhance the model's robustness, we introduced a Patient Node Augmentation network. This network added random noise to the original features during training, defined by the equation Aug(X) = X + (E \u2212 Dropout(E, \u03f5)). This augmentation helped the model generalize better by making it less sensitive to small variations in the input data. During testing and prediction, dropout was not applied to maintain the integrity of the original features.\n\nFinally, a fully connected layer was used to predict ADRs for each patient, expressed as \u0303Y = Predictor(HL_P + HS_P). This comprehensive framework enabled the effective aggregation of heterogeneous patient data, ultimately enhancing ADR predictions. The training objective for the patient-level ADR prediction task was framed as a multi-class, multi-label classification problem. We utilized Focal Loss to address the imbalance in ADRs, defined as  \u0303focal = \u2212 (1 \u2212 Y)\u03b3 \u2217 log(\u0303Y). This loss function helped emphasize harder examples, ensuring that the model paid more attention to less frequent but important ADRs. Additionally, the InfoNCE loss was applied to maximize the agreement between representations generated by the Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HGNN) and the augmentation network, while minimizing the agreement between representations of unrelated samples.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the model utilizes a focusing parameter, denoted as \u03b3, which is crucial for adjusting the loss function. This parameter controls the rate at which the loss decreases as the predicted probability of the correct class increases. The selection of \u03b3 is flexible and can be adjusted to emphasize harder examples more or to treat all examples equally, depending on the specific requirements of the prediction scenario.\n\nAdditionally, the model incorporates a hyper-parameter \u03b1, which is used to balance the weights of the InfoNCE loss and the focal loss in the final training objective. The InfoNCE loss is designed to maximize the agreement between representations generated by the Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HGNN) and the augmentation network, while minimizing the agreement between representations of unrelated data samples. The final training objective is a weighted sum of these two losses, where \u03b1 determines the contribution of each loss component.\n\nThe specific values of \u03b3 and \u03b1 are not fixed and can be optimized through automated machine learning techniques to ensure the model's effectiveness across diverse applications. This flexibility allows for the fine-tuning of the model to achieve optimal performance in different ADR prediction scenarios.",
  "optimization/features": "In the \"Input Features\" subsection, the model leverages a comprehensive array of patient-specific data to enhance the precision of adverse drug reaction (ADR) predictions. The features used as input include essential demographic attributes such as gender, age, and weight. Additionally, the model incorporates intricate medical histories and meticulously maintained medication records. This approach ensures a holistic understanding of each patient's unique health profile, which is crucial for accurate ADR predictions.\n\nFeature selection was not explicitly mentioned as a separate process. Instead, the model aggregates information from various sources to create a robust feature set. The emphasis is on utilizing a wide array of patient-specific data to improve the model's predictive performance. The training process involves leveraging these features to learn latent patient representations, which are then used to enhance the precision of ADR predictions. The model's design ensures that the feature set is comprehensive and relevant to the task of ADR prediction, without the need for additional feature selection steps.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in our study involved a comprehensive approach to ensure both the robustness and generalizability of the PreciseADR model. The model leverages a heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) to aggregate information from various patient-specific attributes, including physiological characteristics, medical histories, medication records, and adverse drug reactions (ADRs).\n\nThe number of parameters in our model is indeed substantial, given the complexity of the data and the need to capture intricate relationships within the heterogeneous graph. However, overfitting was mitigated through several strategies. Firstly, we conducted extensive ablation studies to evaluate the impact of different components of the model, such as the contrastive learning module and the volume of labeled data. These studies helped in fine-tuning the model and ensuring that it generalizes well to unseen data.\n\nAdditionally, we employed regularization techniques and dropout layers to prevent the model from memorizing the training data. The use of a contrastive learning module further enhanced the model's ability to learn robust representations by encouraging the network to distinguish between similar and dissimilar samples.\n\nTo rule out underfitting, we ensured that the model had sufficient capacity to learn from the data. This was achieved by using a deep neural network architecture that could capture complex patterns. Furthermore, we performed hyperparameter tuning using automated machine learning techniques to optimize the model's performance. The experimental results demonstrated significant improvements in ADR prediction compared to baseline models, indicating that the model was neither overfitting nor underfitting.\n\nThe final training objective combined focal loss and InfoNCE loss, which helped in balancing the emphasis on hard examples and ensuring that the model learned meaningful representations. This dual-loss approach contributed to the model's ability to generalize well across different ADR prediction scenarios.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our model. One key method involved the use of dropout during the training phase. Dropout is a regularization technique where random noise is introduced to the original features, helping to prevent the model from becoming too reliant on any single feature. This is achieved by setting a fraction of the input units to zero at each update during training time, which helps to prevent overfitting.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized Focal Loss as our training objective. Focal Loss is particularly effective in handling class imbalances, which are common in ADR prediction tasks. By adjusting the focusing parameter, we were able to emphasize harder examples more, thereby ensuring that the model does not overfit to the more frequent classes.\n\nFurthermore, we incorporated an InfoNCE loss function to maximize the agreement between representations generated by the Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HGNN) and the augmentation network. This contrastive learning approach helps in learning more discriminative features, reducing the risk of overfitting.\n\nThese regularization methods collectively contribute to the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data, enhancing its predictive performance and reliability.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations, optimization schedule, model files, and optimization parameters are not explicitly detailed in the publication. However, the study does mention the use of automated machine learning techniques for optimal hyper-parameter selection, which suggests that these details are managed within the experimental framework. The data used in this paper, including the raw and processed adverse event report dataset, adverse event ontology, and drug ontology, are obtained from the research community via the project website. The raw adverse event reports are obtained from the FAERS. The raw adverse event ontology data from MedDRA are available, which requires subscriptions. The raw drug mapping data from DrugBank are also available. These resources are crucial for replicating the experiments and understanding the optimization processes used in the study. For specific configurations and parameters, further details would need to be accessed through the project website or by contacting the authors directly.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model, PreciseADR, is designed with a focus on interpretability, which is crucial for understanding its predictions and ensuring its reliability in practical applications. Unlike black-box models, PreciseADR incorporates demographic information such as age and gender, which are pivotal for patient-level ADR prediction. This inclusion allows for a more transparent and interpretable model, as the impact of these demographic factors on ADR predictions can be explicitly analyzed.\n\nFor instance, the model's performance was thoroughly validated on 20 age-related ADRs and 20 gender-related ADRs. The results demonstrated that PreciseADR outperformed baseline methods in these specific scenarios, highlighting the model's ability to leverage demographic information effectively. This validation process provides clear examples of how demographic features influence the model's predictions, making it more interpretable.\n\nFurthermore, the ablation study conducted on the model underscored the significance of demographic information. By perturbing these features, it was observed that the model's predictive performance decreased, emphasizing the importance of considering patient-specific attributes. This analysis not only enhances the interpretability of PreciseADR but also reinforces its practical utility in real-world applications.\n\nIn summary, PreciseADR is not a black-box model. Its design and validation processes ensure that the model's predictions are transparent and interpretable, with clear examples demonstrating the impact of demographic information on ADR predictions.",
  "model/output": "The model, PreciseADR, is designed for classification tasks within the domain of adverse drug reaction (ADR) prediction. It focuses on predicting the likelihood of specific ADRs based on patient-level data. The model's output is the predicted probability of the correct class for a given sample, which is used to determine the presence or absence of particular ADRs. This probability is influenced by various factors, including patient demographics, physiological characteristics, medical histories, and medication records. The model employs a combination of heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNN) and contrastive learning to enhance its predictive accuracy. The final training objective integrates both InfoNCE loss and focal loss to optimize the model's performance, ensuring that it can effectively handle both easy and hard examples in the dataset. The results demonstrate that PreciseADR outperforms traditional methods, such as MLP and GCN, in predicting ADRs, particularly those related to age and gender.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time of the model, specifically the time taken to process nodes of a certain type into the i-th message vector, was managed through a linear transformation. This transformation, referred to as M-Linear, projected the nodes into a vector dimension per head, denoted as d_h. The number of attention heads, h, played a crucial role in this process. Following this, a matrix W_MSG was introduced to integrate edge dependency into the message representation. The final message for each node pair, Message(s, e, t), was formed by concatenating all h message heads. This process was repeated through a series of L Heterogeneous Graph Aggregation layers to obtain the representation of patient nodes, denoted as H_L^P. The training objective for the patient-level ADR prediction task was framed as a multi-class, multi-label classification problem, utilizing Focal Loss to handle imbalanced ADRs. Additionally, the InfoNCE loss was applied to maximize the agreement between representations generated by the HGNN network and the augmentation network, while minimizing the agreement between representations of unrelated samples.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "To evaluate the effectiveness of our PreciseADR model, we conducted a series of comprehensive experiments. We framed the patient-level ADR prediction task as a multi-class, multi-label classification problem. To address the imbalance in ADR occurrences, we employed Focal Loss as our training objective. This loss function helps to emphasize harder examples by adjusting the focusing parameter, ensuring that the model pays more attention to less frequent ADRs.\n\nIn addition to Focal Loss, we utilized InfoNCE to maximize the agreement between representations generated by the Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HGNN) and the augmentation network. This approach helps in minimizing the agreement between representations of unrelated samples, thereby enhancing the model's discriminative power.\n\nOur evaluation involved an ablation study to affirm the efficacy of our model design. We examined the impact of training size and the contrastive learning module on the model's performance. The results, depicted in Figure 5, clearly show that increasing the volume of labeled data significantly improves ADR prediction accuracy. Moreover, the introduction of the contrastive learning module further enhances the model's performance, underscoring its practical utility.\n\nWe also compared PreciseADR with other models by replacing the Heterogeneous Graph Aggregation Layers with different architectures, as detailed in Table A2. This comparison highlighted the superior performance of our model in aggregating heterogeneous patient data, leading to more accurate ADR predictions.\n\nFurthermore, we conducted experiments to demonstrate the importance of patient-specific attributes. Perturbing demographic features such as age and gender resulted in a reduction in the model's predictive performance, emphasizing the need to consider these attributes for precise ADR prediction.\n\nOverall, our evaluation methods included a combination of loss functions, ablation studies, and comparative analyses, all of which collectively demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the PreciseADR model in enhancing ADR prediction accuracy.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our evaluation of the PreciseADR model, we focused on several key performance metrics to comprehensively assess its effectiveness in predicting adverse drug reactions (ADRs) at the patient level. The primary metric reported is the Area Under the Curve (AUC), which provides a measure of the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative instances across all possible classification thresholds. This metric is widely used in the literature and offers a robust evaluation of model performance, especially in imbalanced datasets.\n\nAdditionally, we reported the Hit@10 metric, which evaluates the model's precision by measuring the proportion of true positive instances within the top 10 predictions. This metric is particularly relevant in scenarios where the top-ranked predictions are of primary interest, such as in clinical decision-making.\n\nOur choice of metrics is representative of the current literature in ADR prediction, ensuring that our results are comparable with other studies in the field. The AUC metric is standard for evaluating classification models, while the Hit@10 metric provides insights into the model's precision in identifying the most relevant ADRs. Together, these metrics offer a balanced view of the model's performance, highlighting both its discriminative power and its ability to prioritize critical predictions.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our evaluation, we conducted a thorough comparison of our PreciseADR framework with various baseline methods to assess its performance in patient-level ADR prediction. We evaluated our approach against both frequency-based methods and deep learning methods, including those that rely primarily on drug-related features, often referred to as \"Given Drug\" approaches. These methods provide insights into potential side effects at a broader drug level.\n\nOur baselines included several deep learning architectures such as MLP, Transformer, TabNet, AMFormer, and various Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based methods. For the GNN-based methods, we employed a drug-drug co-occurrence graph to derive meaningful drug representations. This graph was constructed by establishing edges between pairs of drugs that jointly appear in adverse event reports. The inclusion of this co-occurrence graph led to a boost in predictive accuracy, particularly in terms of Hit@10, for all GNN models except GATv2.\n\nWe specifically highlighted the performance of our framework against MLP, as GNNs without graph structure effectively reduce to MLP. This comparison underscored the efficacy of incorporating additional information through graphs, which significantly enhanced the prediction capabilities of GNN-based models. Our results demonstrated that PreciseADR consistently outperformed traditional MLP and showed competitive performance with Transformer models.\n\nAdditionally, we conducted ablation studies to further affirm the efficacy of our model design. These studies included varying the volume of labeled data and incorporating a contrastive learning module, both of which significantly improved the model's performance. The findings from these experiments reinforced the importance of utilizing a larger quantity of labeled ADR records and the benefits of contrastive learning in enhancing predictive accuracy.\n\nOverall, our evaluation showed that PreciseADR stands out as the top performer among various baseline methods, achieving superior performance in patient-level ADR prediction. This was evident through the comprehensive approach that leverages patient-specific data, including demographic attributes, medical histories, and medication records, ensuring unparalleled accuracy in predictions.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the PreciseADR model demonstrates its superior performance in patient-level ADR prediction. The results highlight a significant improvement in predictive accuracy when incorporating patient-specific features such as age, gender, medical history, and medication records. This improvement is quantified as a notable 3.2% increase in the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric compared to baseline methods.\n\nThe inclusion of a drug-drug co-occurrence graph in GNN-based models further enhances predictive performance, particularly in terms of Hit@10. This graph, constructed by establishing edges between drugs that appear together in adverse event reports, leads to a boost in predictive accuracy for all GNN models except GATv2. The use of MLP as a feature extractor in these GNN models allows for a direct comparison, showing that the graph structure significantly improves performance over traditional MLP and demonstrates competitive results with Transformer models.\n\nThe statistical significance of these results is underscored by the consistent outperforming of PreciseADR against various baseline methods, including frequency-based and deep learning approaches. The experimental findings affirm that the integration of patient-specific data and drug co-occurrence information is pivotal in achieving superior ADR prediction accuracy. This comprehensive approach ensures that the model's predictions are not only accurate but also reliable, providing a robust framework for patient-centric healthcare.",
