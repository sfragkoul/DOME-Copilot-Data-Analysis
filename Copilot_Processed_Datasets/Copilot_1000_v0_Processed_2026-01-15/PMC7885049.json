  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset utilized in this study was derived from a comprehensive analysis of lipid metabolites in plasma samples. The study population consisted of 2129 individuals, categorized into four groups: tuberculosis (TB) patients, lung cancer (LC) patients, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients, and normal healthy controls (NC). Specifically, the TB group included 534 individuals, the LC group had 525 individuals, the CAP group comprised 530 individuals, and the NC group consisted of 530 individuals.\n\nThe data collected included various clinical characteristics such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), triglycerides (TG), cholesterol (CHOL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Additionally, specific medical findings like the presence of caseous necrosis cavities, sputum bacteria, bronchial tuberculosis, and pleural effusion were documented for the TB group.\n\nThis dataset has not been previously used in other published papers or by the community. The lipidomics data were analyzed using advanced techniques such as Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), and statistical methods including principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). The study aimed to identify potential biomarkers for tuberculosis by evaluating the differential expression of lipid metabolites across the different groups.",
  "dataset/splits": "Not applicable",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset was divided into 10 parts for cross-validation purposes. In this process, 9 parts were used as training data, and 1 part was used as test data. This procedure was repeated 10 times, with each part serving as the test set once, ensuring that every data point was used for both training and testing. This method, known as 10-fold cross-validation, helps to ensure that the training and test sets are independent in each fold, reducing the risk of overfitting and providing a more robust evaluation of the model's performance.\n\nThe distribution of the dataset was not explicitly compared to previously published machine learning datasets. However, the use of 10-fold cross-validation is a standard practice in machine learning, ensuring that the model's performance is evaluated on multiple independent test sets, which is consistent with best practices in the field. This approach helps to mitigate issues related to dataset redundancy and ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm used in this study is a machine learning method known as logistic regression. This is a well-established algorithm class commonly used for binary classification problems, which in this case is to diagnose tuberculosis based on lipid biomarkers.\n\nThe logistic regression algorithm used is not new; it is a widely recognized and extensively used method in statistical and machine learning literature. The reason it was not published in a machine-learning journal is that the focus of this research is on the identification of potential lipid biomarkers for active pulmonary tuberculosis using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The machine learning aspect is a tool used to achieve the primary goal of the study, which is to diagnose tuberculosis accurately. The innovation lies in the application of this method to the specific problem of tuberculosis diagnosis rather than in the development of a new machine learning algorithm.",
  "optimization/meta": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps. Initially, the metabolites in the samples were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively using an internal metabolite database. The signal intensity of characteristic ions was obtained in counts per second, and chromatographic peaks were integrated and corrected using MultiQuant software. The relative abundance of lipid metabolites in plasma was determined by calculating the peak area of each chromatogram in the mass spectrometry data.\n\nStatistical analysis was performed to evaluate the data quality of lipid metabolites in terms of homogeneity and reproducibility. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used for this evaluation. Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was then applied to remove irrelevant variables, and variable importance in the projection (VIP) values were obtained to measure the contribution of variables to the model. The quality of the OPLS-DA model was validated using a permutation test.\n\nThe differentially expressed lipid metabolites were identified by combining fold change (FC), false discovery rate (FDR), and VIP values. The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity of differentially expressed lipids were obtained using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic value of the combined biomarkers model. The 10-fold cross-validation method was used to verify the accuracy of the diagnostic model.\n\nFor bioinformatics analysis, patients in the tuberculosis (TB) group were divided into subgroups based on chest computed tomography (CT) imaging findings. The changes in lipids between the normal control (NC) group and TB subgroups were evaluated using the K-means clustering algorithm with a K value of 6. A multivariate polyline trend graph was drawn to visualize these changes. The analysis of metabolic pathways was performed using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). The Pearson correlation coefficients of differentially expressed lipid metabolites were analyzed, and the correlation network was visualized using Cytoscape.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, several parameters were optimized for the mass spectrometry analysis. The mass spectrum voltage was set at 5500 V. The ion source gases, including gas I, gas II, and the curtain gas, were adjusted to 55 psi, 60 psi, and 25 psi, respectively. The collision-activated dissociation parameter was configured to medium. Each ion pair was scanned with optimized declustering potential and collision energy. The scanning process was conducted in both positive and negative ion modes using Linear Ion Trap (LIT) and triple quadrupole (QQQ) instruments. The entire scanning procedure was managed using Analyst 1.6.3 software.\n\nThe selection of these parameters was based on standard protocols and optimization procedures to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the lipidomics data. The specific values for the ion source gases and voltage were chosen to achieve optimal ionization and detection of the metabolites. The medium setting for collision-activated dissociation was selected to balance the fragmentation of ions, providing clear and interpretable mass spectra. The use of both positive and negative ion modes allowed for the comprehensive detection of a wide range of lipid metabolites. The software Analyst 1.6.3 was utilized for its robust data acquisition and processing capabilities, ensuring high-quality data output.",
  "optimization/features": "The study utilized a comprehensive set of lipid metabolites as input features for the diagnostic model. Specifically, 22 differentially expressed lipids were identified and analyzed for their diagnostic potential. These lipids were selected based on their fold change, false discovery rate, and variable importance in projection values, ensuring that only the most relevant features were considered.\n\nFeature selection was indeed performed to enhance the model's performance and interpretability. This process involved evaluating the lipid metabolites' significance through statistical tests and multivariate analyses. The selection criteria included a fold change threshold of greater than 1.2 or less than 0.83, a variable importance in projection value greater than 1, and a false discovery rate of less than 0.05. These stringent criteria helped in identifying the most discriminative lipids between the different groups, including the tuberculosis (TB) group and the control groups.\n\nTo maintain the integrity of the model, feature selection was conducted using the training set only. This approach prevented data leakage and ensured that the model's performance on the test set was a true reflection of its generalizability. By adhering to this practice, the study aimed to develop a robust diagnostic model that could accurately distinguish between TB patients and other groups based on the selected lipid biomarkers.",
  "optimization/fitting": "Not applicable",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our models. One of the key methods used was the orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). This technique helps in removing irrelevant variables and focuses on the variables that contribute most to the separation between groups, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting.\n\nAdditionally, we validated the quality of the OPLS-DA model using a permutation test. This test involves randomly permuting the class labels and comparing the model's performance with the original labels. A significant difference in performance indicates that the model is not overfitting to the original data.\n\nFurthermore, we used a 10-fold cross-validation method to verify the accuracy of our diagnostic model. This technique involves dividing the dataset into 10 parts, using 9 parts for training and 1 part for testing, and repeating this process 10 times. This approach ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data and is not merely memorizing the training data.\n\nTo control for multiple hypothesis testing, we adjusted the false discovery rate (FDR) using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. This adjustment helps in controlling the proportion of false positives among the significant results, further mitigating the risk of overfitting.\n\nOverall, these regularization techniques ensured that our models were robust, generalizable, and not prone to overfitting.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters used in our study are reported within the publication. Specifically, the mass spectrum voltage was set at 5500 V, with ion source gases (GSI, GSII, and CUR) set at 55, 60, and 25 psi, respectively. The collision-activated dissociation parameter was set to medium. Each ion pair was scanned according to optimized declustering potential and collision energy. Both positive and negative ion modes were utilized under the scans of Linear Ion Trap (LIT) and triple quadrupole (QQQ). The entire scanning process was controlled by Analyst 1.6.3 software.\n\nThe raw data processing was completed using the same software, Analyst 1.6.3. For statistical analysis, various tests such as the Chi-square test, Kruskal\u2013Wallis H test, and Mann\u2013Whitney U test were employed, with a P value of less than 0.05 indicating statistical significance. Principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were used to evaluate data quality and remove irrelevant variables. The variable importance in the projection (VIP) values were obtained to measure the contribution of variables to the model. The quality of the OPLS-DA model was validated using a permutation test. The t-test was used to obtain P values for individual variables, followed by false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment using multiple hypothesis tests. These analyses were conducted using R 3.5.3.\n\nThe differentially expressed lipid metabolites were determined by combining fold change (FC), FDR, and VIP values. The diagnostic value of the combined biomarkers model was evaluated using logistic regression analysis, and the accuracy of the diagnostic model was verified using the 10-fold cross-validation method.

  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a blackbox. It utilizes several transparent and interpretable methods to identify and validate potential biomarkers for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB).\n\nOne of the key methods used is the orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). This statistical technique is transparent as it projects the predictor variables and the response variable into a new space, highlighting the variables that contribute most to the separation between groups. The variable importance in the projection (VIP) values obtained from OPLS-DA quantify the contribution of each lipid variable to the model, providing clear insights into which lipids are most relevant for distinguishing between TB and other conditions.\n\nAdditionally, the study uses Pearson correlation coefficients to analyze the synergistic regulation relationships among various lipids in plasma. This approach is transparent because it directly measures the strength and direction of the relationships between different lipid metabolites. The correlation network visualizes these relationships, with colored circles representing different lipid classes and lines indicating positive or negative correlations. This visualization makes it easy to understand how different lipids interact and contribute to the diagnostic model.\n\nThe logistic regression model used for evaluating the diagnostic value of combined biomarkers is also transparent. It provides clear coefficients for each biomarker, indicating their individual contributions to the diagnostic prediction. The 10-fold cross-validation method further verifies the accuracy and reliability of the model, ensuring that the results are robust and generalizable.\n\nOverall, the model's transparency is enhanced by the use of interpretable statistical methods, clear visualizations, and validated diagnostic metrics. This ensures that the findings are not only statistically sound but also biologically meaningful and easily understandable.",

  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our diagnostic model for lipid biomarkers of pulmonary tuberculosis, several key performance metrics were reported. The primary metrics used were sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the curve (AUC) from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. These metrics are widely recognized and used in the literature for evaluating the performance of diagnostic models.\n\nSensitivity, also known as the true positive rate, measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified by the model.
