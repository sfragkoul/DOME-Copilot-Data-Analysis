  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from human stool and serum samples. The stool samples underwent faecal shotgun metagenomic sequencing, while both stool and serum samples were analyzed for metabolomics. The DNA extraction and sequencing were performed by the Center for Microbiome Innovation at UCSD, using the Illumina HiSeq4000 platform. Metabolite extraction and analysis were also conducted by the same center, employing liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS).\n\nThe study involved a total of 25 stool samples for the training set, which included 16 samples from compensated cirrhotic patients and 9 from decompensated cirrhotic patients. Additionally, 23 matched serum and stool samples were used for metabolomic analysis. The dataset was not split into discovery or validation sets and was solely used for the training process.\n\nThe metagenomic data underwent quality control, taxa profiling with MetaPhlAn2, functional pathway profiling with HUMAnN2, and translation search with DIAMOND-UniRef90. The metabolomic data was processed using specific extraction procedures and analyzed with an ultra-high-resolution Qq-time-of-flight (UHR-QqTOF) mass spectrometer.\n\nThe dataset utilized in this study has not been previously published or used by the community. The study focused on developing and validating a model using metagenome-derived signatures to distinguish between decompensated and compensated NAFLD cirrhosis. The model identified a stool metagenomic signature comprised of 13 discriminatory species, which demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy. The dataset's unique focus on NAFLD cirrhosis and the specific analytical methods employed make it a novel contribution to the field.",
  "dataset/splits": "There was only one data split used for the training process. This split consisted of a total of 25 stool samples, with 16 samples from compensated cirrhotic patients and 9 samples from decompensated cirrhotic patients. The samples were not divided into separate discovery or validation sets within this training split. The model was later validated using an independent test cohort, but this was not considered a separate data split in the initial training phase.",

  "dataset/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used is Random Forest (RF), a well-established supervised learning method. This algorithm is not new; it has been widely used and studied in the field of machine learning for many years. The choice to use Random Forest in this context was driven by its robustness and ability to handle complex datasets, making it suitable for identifying signatures from metagenomic and metabolomic datasets.\n\nThe decision to utilize Random Forest in this study was likely influenced by its proven effectiveness in similar biological and medical research applications. Random Forest is known for its ability to manage high-dimensional data, reduce overfitting, and provide feature importance scores, which are crucial for identifying key discriminatory species or metabolites.\n\nGiven that Random Forest is a established algorithm, it was not necessary to publish the algorithm itself in a machine-learning journal. Instead, the focus of the publication is on the application of this algorithm to a specific biomedical problem, namely distinguishing decompensated cirrhosis samples from compensated cirrhosis samples using metagenomic and metabolomic data. The innovation lies in the application and the specific findings related to the disease rather than the algorithm itself.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model developed in this study is not a meta-predictor. It relies solely on the Random Forest (RF) supervised learning algorithm available in the Classification And Regression Training (caret) package in R. The RF algorithm was used to identify signatures from metagenomic datasets to distinguish decompensated cirrhosis samples from compensated cirrhosis samples.\n\nThe RF model was trained using a dataset of 25 stool samples, with 16 from compensated cirrhotic patients and 9 from decompensated cirrhotic patients. The training process involved 10-fold cross-validation, smote sampling mode, and 10 repeats in trainControl. Hyperparameters were tuned using grid search, and feature selection was performed based on the importance scores of the RF outcome.\n\nThe model's performance was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) and compared with the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. The trained RF model with the final features was retained for validation studies. The validation was conducted using an independent test cohort, ensuring that the training and validation datasets were independent.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the machine-learning algorithm, the data encoding and preprocessing involved several steps. Initially, relative abundance taxonomic tables were pre-processed using the preProcess and predict functions with the zv, scale, and centre methods. This preprocessing aimed to standardize the data, ensuring that each feature contributed equally to the model. The zv method was used to zero-variance features, the scale method standardized the features to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, and the centre method centered the features by subtracting the mean.\n\nThe Random Forest (RF) supervised learning algorithm was utilized to develop models capable of distinguishing decompensated cirrhosis samples from compensated cirrhosis samples. The data was split into training and validation sets, with the training set consisting of 25 stool samples, including 16 compensated cirrhotic samples and 9 decompensated cirrhotic samples. The training process involved 10-fold cross-validation, SMOTE sampling mode, and 10 repeats in trainControl to ensure robust model performance.\n\nTo search for the best hyperparameters, the mtry value, which determines the number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split, was set within a range of (\u22121, 0, and +1 of the square root of the feature number) during grid tuning. The ntree setting, specifying the number of trees to grow, was set to 501 with the ROC metric option. This configuration helped in building a robust model by ensuring that a sufficient number of trees were considered, and the model was evaluated based on its ability to discriminate between the classes.\n\nFeature selection was a crucial part of the preprocessing. Features (species or metabolites) from the feature importance scores of the RF outcome were examined to identify a set of features that trained a forest with the highest overall accuracy of sample classification. The importance scores of features were extracted using the varImp function and tested iteratively by ordering from highest to lowest Mean Decrease in Gini index. Different combinations of features from the top rank were examined by calculating the area under the curve (AUC). This iterative process helped in optimizing the number of signature sets, with the top-performing models utilizing 13 microbiome species. The features used to train a forest with the best-performing AUC were retained for further analyses. The trained RF model with final features was also retained for validation studies.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In the optimization process, the number of parameters (p) used in the model was determined through a systematic approach involving feature selection and hyperparameter tuning. Initially, a set of features, specifically 13 top-discriminatory taxa abundances, was identified as crucial for distinguishing between decompensated and compensated cirrhosis samples. These features were selected based on their importance scores derived from the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, which were examined iteratively by ordering from highest to lowest Mean Decrease in Gini index.\n\nTo optimize the model, the mtry parameter, which represents the number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split, was set within a range of (\u22121, 0, and +1 of the square root of the feature number) during grid tuning. This range was chosen to ensure a thorough exploration of potential parameter values. Additionally, the ntree parameter, which specifies the number of trees to grow, was set to 501. The model was trained using 10-fold cross-validation, synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) sampling mode, and 10 repeats in trainControl to enhance the robustness and generalizability of the results.\n\nThe final model utilized the top-performing features, which were determined to be the 13 microbiome species that provided the highest overall accuracy in sample classification. These features were selected through an iterative process that involved calculating the area under the curve (AUC) for different combinations of features from the top rank. The features that resulted in the best-performing model in terms of AUC were retained for further analyses and validation studies. This approach ensured that the model was optimized for accuracy and reliability in distinguishing between the two types of cirrhosis samples.",
  "optimization/features": "The input features for the model were derived from metagenomic data, specifically the relative abundance of taxonomic tables. Initially, a comprehensive set of features was considered, but feature selection was performed to optimize the model.\n\nFeature selection was conducted using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, which identified the most important features based on their Mean Decrease in Gini index. This process involved extracting importance scores from the RF outcome and iteratively testing different combinations of features to find the set that provided the highest overall accuracy in sample classification.\n\nThe feature selection process was performed using the training set only, ensuring that the model's performance was evaluated on an independent validation set. The final model utilized 13 microbiome species as input features, which were selected based on their discriminatory power in distinguishing between decompensated and compensated cirrhosis samples. These 13 species were chosen because they formed the top-performing model in terms of area under the curve (AUC).",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study utilized the Random Forest (RF) supervised learning algorithm, which is known for its robustness in handling high-dimensional data. The number of parameters, in this case, the number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split (mtry), was tuned using a grid search within a range around the square root of the feature number. This approach helps to mitigate the risk of overfitting by ensuring that the model does not become too complex relative to the number of training points.\n\nTo further rule out overfitting, 10-fold cross-validation was used during the training process. This technique involves splitting the data into 10 subsets, training the model on 9 subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated 10 times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. Additionally, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied to handle class imbalance, and the training process was repeated 10 times to ensure the stability and generalizability of the model.\n\nThe number of trees (ntree) was set to 501, which is a sufficiently large number to ensure that the model captures the underlying patterns in the data without overfitting. The model's performance was evaluated using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) metric, which provides a comprehensive measure of the model's ability to distinguish between the classes.\n\nTo address underfitting, feature selection was performed using the importance scores from the RF model. Features were ranked based on their Mean Decrease in Gini index, and different combinations of top-ranked features were tested to find the optimal set that maximizes the model's accuracy. This iterative process ensures that the model is neither too simple nor too complex, striking a balance between bias and variance.\n\nThe final model was trained using 13 top-discriminatory taxa abundances, which were identified through this rigorous feature selection process. The model's diagnostic accuracy was validated in an independent test cohort, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability. The area under the curve (AUC) values for the training and validation cohorts were 0.97 and 0.95, respectively, indicating that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting when developing our Random Forest models. One key method was 10-fold cross-validation, which involved dividing the dataset into 10 subsets, training the model on 9 subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This process was repeated 10 times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. Additionally, we used Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address class imbalance, which can help in preventing the model from becoming biased towards the majority class.\n\nWe also utilized hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance. Specifically, we tuned the mtry parameter, which determines the number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split. The range for mtry was set between -1, 0, and +1 of the square root of the feature number. This tuning process helped in finding the optimal number of features to consider at each split, thereby improving the model's generalization ability.\n\nFurthermore, we performed feature selection based on the importance scores derived from the Random Forest outcomes. Features were ranked by their Mean Decrease in Gini index, and different combinations of top-ranked features were tested to find the set that provided the highest overall accuracy in sample classification. This iterative process ensured that only the most relevant features were included in the final model, reducing the risk of overfitting.\n\nThe final model was trained with 13 top-discriminatory taxa abundances, which were selected based on their importance scores and their ability to improve the model's performance. This careful selection of features and the use of cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning helped in building a robust model that generalizes well to independent datasets.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization schedule used in our study are available within the text of the publication. Specifically, we utilized the Random Forest (RF) algorithm with the following configurations: 10-fold cross-validation, SMOTE sampling mode, and 10 repeats in trainControl. The mtry value, which determines the number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split, was set within a range of -1, 0, and +1 of the square root of the feature number. The ntree setting, specifying the number of trees to grow, was set to 501, with the ROC metric option enabled.\n\nFor feature selection, we examined the importance scores of features derived from the RF outcome to identify a set of features that trained a forest with the highest overall accuracy of sample classification. The importance scores were extracted using the varImp function and tested iteratively by ordering from highest to lowest Mean Decrease in Gini index. Different combinations of features from the top rank were examined by calculating the area under the curve (AUC).\n\nThe final model, which utilized 13 microbiome species, was retained for further analyses and validation studies. The trained RF model with the final features is also available for reference. The training set consisted of 25 stool samples, with 16 from compensated cirrhotic samples and 9 from decompensated cirrhotic samples.\n\nThe AUC calculations were performed using the auc function of the pROC package, and the models were validated using an independent test cohort. The predict function of the caret package was used with the prob type option to test the models in the validation dataset. The ROC function was utilized with settings of boot.n = 100 and ci.alpha = 0.9 to obtain AUC scores, and the plot function in R was used for visualizing the AUC outcomes.\n\nThe specific model files and optimization parameters are not explicitly provided in a separate repository or under a specific license, but the detailed configurations and steps are thoroughly described within the publication. This information should be sufficient for replication and further study by interested researchers.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a blackbox model. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm used for distinguishing decompensated cirrhosis samples from compensated cirrhosis samples is inherently interpretable. This is because RF models provide feature importance scores, which indicate the contribution of each feature (in this case, microbial species or metabolites) to the model's predictions.\n\nThe feature importance scores were extracted using the varImp function, and the top features were identified based on the Mean Decrease in Gini index. This process allowed for the selection of a set of 13 microbiome species that were most discriminatory between the two conditions. These species included increases in Veillonella parvula, Veillonella atypica, Bacteroides vulgatus, and Bacteroides stercoris, and decreases in species such as Eubacterium rectale, Eubacterium hallii, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in decompensated NAFLD cirrhosis compared to compensated NAFLD cirrhosis.\n\nBy examining these top features, it is possible to gain insights into the biological mechanisms underlying the differences between decompensated and compensated cirrhosis. For example, the enrichment of certain bacterial classes like Negativicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidia in decompensated cirrhosis provides specific taxonomic shifts that can be further investigated for their roles in disease progression.\n\nMoreover, the model's transparency is further enhanced by the use of visualizations such as ROC curves and AUC comparisons, which provide a clear understanding of the model's performance and the reliability of the identified microbial signature. The diagnostic accuracy of the 13-species signature was compared to the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, demonstrating superior discrimination for decompensated cirrhosis.\n\nIn summary, the RF model used in this study is transparent and interpretable, allowing for the identification of key microbial species that differentiate between decompensated and compensated NAFLD cirrhosis. This transparency enables a deeper understanding of the underlying biological processes and provides actionable insights for further research and clinical applications.",
  "model/output": "The model developed is a classification model. It utilizes the Random Forest (RF) supervised learning algorithm to distinguish between decompensated and compensated cirrhosis samples. The model was trained using metagenomic and metabolomic datasets, with a focus on identifying signatures that could accurately classify the disease status. The classification performance was evaluated using metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC), which demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy. The final model retained 13 microbiome species that provided the best classification performance, indicating its effectiveness in distinguishing between the two conditions.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method involved a combination of cross-sectional analysis and model validation techniques. Initially, a cross-sectional analysis was performed to identify a signature of decompensated NAFLD cirrhosis from the faecal metagenome. This analysis included quality control of raw reads, taxa profiling, functional pathway profiling, and translation search. The data was then processed using various bioinformatics tools and packages to compute alpha-diversity, beta-diversity, and composition analysis.\n\nTo develop models capable of distinguishing decompensated cirrhosis samples from compensated cirrhosis samples, the Random Forest (RF) supervised learning algorithm was utilized. The model was trained using 10-fold cross-validation with SMOTE sampling mode and 10 repeats. Hyperparameters were tuned using grid search, and feature selection was performed based on the importance scores of the RF outcome. The top-performing model utilized 13 microbiome species.\n\nThe trained RF model was then validated using an independent test cohort. The model's performance was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The validation demonstrated that the microbial signature had robust accuracy in independent cohorts, with AUC values of 0.97 in the training cohort and 0.95 in the validation cohort.\n\nAdditionally, the diagnostic accuracy of the faecal metagenome-derived signature was compared with the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. The RF model using 13 discriminatory species showed superior performance in predicting decompensated NAFLD cirrhosis compared to the MELD score.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our models, several performance metrics were reported to ensure a comprehensive assessment of their diagnostic accuracy. The primary metric used was the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC), which provides a measure of the model's ability to distinguish between decompensated and compensated NAFLD cirrhosis. For the training cohort, the AUROC for the 13-species microbial signature was 0.97, indicating excellent discriminatory power. This was compared to the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, which had an AUROC of 0.84, demonstrating the superior performance of the microbial signature.\n\nThe diagnostic accuracy was further validated in an independent test cohort. In this cohort, the AUROC for the 13-species signature remained high at 0.95, while the MELD score had an AUROC of 0.80. These results consistently showed that the microbial signature outperformed the MELD score in both the training and validation cohorts.\n\nAdditionally, sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the diagnostic accuracy of the 13-species metagenomic signature after adjusting for medication exposure. The AUROC values remained robust across different adjustments, including rifaximin (AUROC 0.92), lactulose (AUROC 0.99), metformin (AUROC 0.92), and proton pump inhibitor use (AUROC 0.92). These analyses confirmed the stability and reliability of the microbial signature regardless of medication use.\n\nThe reported metrics are representative of standard practices in the literature for evaluating diagnostic models, particularly in the context of metagenomic and metabolomic studies. The use of AUROC is a well-established method for assessing the performance of binary classifiers, and comparing it to a widely used clinical score like the MELD score provides a meaningful benchmark. The consistent high performance across different cohorts and conditions underscores the robustness of the identified microbial signature.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "The evaluation of our models included a comparison with established methods to assess their performance. Specifically, we compared our Random Forest (RF) model, which utilized a metagenomic signature of 13 discriminatory species, against the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. The MELD score is a widely used clinical tool for predicting mortality in patients with end-stage liver disease.\n\nIn our training cohort, both the MELD score and the 13-species signature demonstrated reliable discrimination between decompensated and compensated non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) cirrhosis. However, the 13-species microbial signature showed superior discrimination with an area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) of 0.97, compared to the MELD score's AUROC of 0.84. This superiority was statistically significant (p < 0.001).\n\nWe further validated these findings in an independent test cohort. In this cohort, the 13-species metagenomic signature maintained high discriminative ability with an AUROC of 0.95, while the MELD score had an AUROC of 0.80. Again, the microbial signature demonstrated superior discrimination (p < 0.001).\n\nAdditionally, we conducted sensitivity analyses to examine the diagnostic accuracy of the 13-species metagenomic signature after adjusting for medication exposure, which differed between decompensated and compensated participants. The diagnostic accuracy of the model remained high after adjustments for various medications, including rifaximin, lactulose, metformin, and proton pump inhibitors, with AUROC values ranging from 0.92 to 0.99.\n\nThese comparisons indicate that our metagenomic-derived signature provides a more accurate and reliable method for distinguishing between decompensated and compensated NAFLD cirrhosis compared to the MELD score.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our model's performance included several key metrics with associated confidence intervals to ensure robustness. For instance, the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) for the 13-species microbial signature was reported with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.96\u20130.99 in the training cohort, indicating high precision. Similarly, in the independent test cohort, the AUROC for the same signature had a 95% CI of 0.81\u20131.00, further validating its reliability.\n\nStatistical significance was a crucial aspect of our evaluation. The permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) test showed a p-value of 0.001 when comparing decompensated and compensated NAFLD cirrhosis, confirming significant differences in microbial composition. Additionally, the comparison of the 13-species signature with the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score demonstrated superior discrimination, with p-values less than 0.001 in both the training and validation cohorts. This statistical significance underscores the model's superiority over traditional methods like the MELD score.\n\nFurthermore, sensitivity analyses were conducted to adjust for medication exposure, which differed between decompensated and compensated participants. The diagnostic accuracy of the model remained high after adjustments for medications such as rifaximin, lactulose, metformin, and proton pump inhibitors, with AUROC values ranging from 0.92 to 0.99. These analyses provide additional confidence in the model's performance across different conditions.",
