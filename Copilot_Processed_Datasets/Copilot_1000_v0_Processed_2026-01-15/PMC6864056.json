  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study originates from the BREAST-Stamp Project, focusing on women who were referred for an image-guided breast biopsy. The study population consisted of 852 women, with 588 included in the training set and 264 in the testing set. The training set encompassed 687 biopsies, resulting in 1587 H&E stained sections, while the testing set included 349 biopsies with 454 sections from non-target blocks.\n\nThe data utilized in this study includes digitized H&E-stained breast biopsy tissue sections, which were scanned at \u00d720 magnification using either the Aperio or Hamamatsu scanning systems. Additionally, pre-biopsy raw digital mammograms from full-field digital mammography systems were assessed for breast density at the University of California, San Francisco. The mammograms were used to determine quantitative global and localized fibroglandular tissue volume measures.\n\nThe datasets supporting specific figures and tables from the published article are publicly available in the figshare repository. However, the raw datasets generated and analyzed during this study, as well as datasets supporting other figures and tables, are not publicly available to protect patient privacy. De-identified data can be made available upon request from the corresponding author.\n\nThe code developed during the current study is also available upon reasonable request. This approach ensures that the community can access and utilize the data and code for further research while maintaining patient confidentiality.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was randomly subdivided into two main splits: a training dataset and a testing dataset. The training dataset consisted of 588 women, encompassing 687 biopsies which included 1587 H&E stained sections. Of these, 667 sections were from the target blocks and 920 from the non-target blocks. The testing dataset comprised 264 women, with 349 biopsies resulting in 454 sections from non-target blocks. The training set accounted for approximately 69% of the total data, while the testing set made up about 31%.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets were split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the prediction models. The training set was used to develop the models, while the testing set was used to assess their predictive accuracy on unseen data. The training and testing sets were independent, ensuring that the models were evaluated on data that was not used during their training. This independence was enforced by separating the datasets based on patient characteristics, with statistical tests such as chi-square or Fisher\u2019s exact tests for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continuous variables used to compare patient characteristics between the two sets. This approach helped to ensure that the distributions of relevant variables were similar between the training and testing sets, reducing the risk of bias and improving the generalizability of the results.\n\nThe distribution of the datasets compares favorably to previously published machine learning datasets in the field of breast cancer research. The use of random forest models, which can handle non-linear relationships and high-dimensional data, was particularly well-suited to the complexity of the features extracted from the convolutional neural network output. The models were trained using the scikit-learn Python method, which is a widely recognized and reliable tool for machine learning tasks. The performance of the models was assessed using metrics such as the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Spearman rank correlations, providing a comprehensive evaluation of their predictive accuracy. Overall, the datasets and methods used in this study align with best practices in machine learning and contribute to the growing body of research on breast cancer prediction.",

The raw datasets generated and analyzed during this study, as well as datasets supporting other figures and tables, are not publicly available to protect patient privacy. However, de-identified data can be made available upon request. This request process ensures that sensitive information remains confidential while still allowing for potential further research and verification of the study's findings. The figshare data record describes the procedure for requesting access to the de-identified data.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in our study is the random forest. This algorithm was chosen for its ability to handle non-linear relationships between features and its robustness even when the number of features exceeds the number of observations.\n\nThe random forest algorithm is not new; it is a well-established method in the field of machine learning. It was selected for this study due to its proven effectiveness in various predictive modeling tasks, particularly in medical and biological research.\n\nThe reason the random forest algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that our focus was on applying this established method to a specific problem in breast cancer research. The primary goal of our study was to explore the potential of extracted histologic features for predicting cancer status and fibroglandular volume, rather than developing a new machine-learning algorithm. Therefore, the publication was more appropriately suited for a journal that specializes in breast cancer research, where the clinical implications and findings would be of greatest interest to the relevant scientific community.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employed in this study does not function as a meta-predictor. Instead, it relies on a single machine-learning algorithm, specifically a random forest model, to predict fibroglandular volume and cancer status. The random forest models were trained using features extracted from a convolutional neural network (CNN) that was developed to classify breast tissue into epithelial, stromal, and fat regions. These features were categorized into three main groups: global tissue quantities, morphology of epithelial regions, and spatial arrangements of epithelial regions.\n\nThe CNN was trained on digitized H&E-stained breast biopsy tissue sections from a subset of the study population, and its performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), which was reported to be 0.95. The features extracted from the CNN output were then used to train the random forest models for predicting global and localized fibroglandular volume, as well as for classifying cancer status.\n\nThe study population was randomly subdivided into training and testing datasets to ensure independence of the training data. The training set consisted of 588 women with 687 biopsies, while the testing set included 264 women with 349 biopsies. This subdivision was done to validate the model's performance on an independent dataset, ensuring that the results were not biased by the training process.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding process involved several steps to prepare the images for the machine-learning algorithm. Initially, H&E-stained breast biopsy tissue sections were digitized at \u00d720 magnification using Aperio or Hamamatsu scanning systems. These digitized whole slide images were then used to train a deep convolutional neural network. The network was an 11-layer fully convolutional VGG-like architecture, designed to classify the images into epithelial, stromal, and fat tissue regions. The training process involved manual annotation of these regions in 100 whole slide images by trained students, which were subsequently reviewed by a pathologist. This annotated data was used to train the convolutional neural network, which achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.95 for classifying breast tissue.\n\nFollowing the generation of whole slide image maps, features were extracted from the convolutional neural network output. These features were categorized into three main groups: global tissue quantities, morphology of the epithelial regions, and spatial arrangements of epithelial regions. To analyze the spatial arrangements, region adjacency graphs, including area-Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulation, were employed. The area-Voronoi diagram was used to define areas of influence of epithelial regions in the image. Overall, 37 features were extracted within these three categories. These features were then used to train random forest models for predicting global and localized fibroglandular volume percentages. The scikit-learn Python method was utilized for training these models, which can handle non-linear relationships and work effectively even when the number of features exceeds the number of observations. The output from the random forest model included the Gini index plot, which measured the predictive importance of the features.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized 37 features extracted from the output of a convolutional neural network to train our random forest models. These features were categorized into three main groups: global tissue quantities, morphology of the epithelial regions, and spatial arrangements of epithelial regions. The selection of these features was based on their relevance to the prediction of fibroglandular volume, both globally and locally. We employed techniques such as area-Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulation to analyze the spatial arrangements of epithelial regions, which contributed significantly to the feature set.\n\nThe number of features was determined through a careful process of extraction and validation. Initially, a larger set of features was considered, but we reduced the number to 37 by focusing on those that provided the most predictive power. This reduction was achieved by examining the correlations among features and excluding highly correlated pairs to avoid redundancy. The final set of 37 features was used to train the random forest models, which demonstrated robust performance in predicting fibroglandular volume measures.\n\nAdditionally, we included body mass index (BMI) as an input parameter in our models to account for its known association with fibroglandular volume. This inclusion helped to enhance the predictive accuracy of our models. The top features identified in the random forest models, including BMI, were ranked based on their importance in predicting global and localized fibroglandular volume. This ranking provided insights into which features were most influential in the model's predictions.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized a total of 37 features as input for our prediction models. These features were extracted from the output of a convolutional neural network applied to whole slide images. The features were categorized into three main groups: global tissue quantities, morphology of the epithelial regions, and spatial arrangements of epithelial regions. The spatial arrangements were analyzed using region adjacency graphs, including area-Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulation.\n\nFeature selection was performed to handle highly correlated features. For feature pairs with a Spearman correlation of 0.85 or higher, one feature was randomly excluded from the model. This process was conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the testing set remained independent and unbiased. However, the top selected features for fibroglandular volume prediction were similar whether using all 37 features or a reduced set, so we presented results from analyses including all 37 features. This approach allowed us to maintain a comprehensive feature set while mitigating the impact of multicollinearity.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed random forest models for predicting fibroglandular volume measures. The number of features extracted from the convolutional neural network output was 37, which is relatively large compared to the number of observations in our training set of 588 women. To address the potential issue of overfitting, we utilized several strategies.\n\nFirstly, we performed sensitivity analyses to examine the influence of participant characteristics and highly correlated features. For highly correlated feature pairs, we randomly selected one feature to exclude from the model, reducing the number of features to 25. We then retrained the random forest models on these remaining features and found that the top selected features for fibroglandular volume prediction were similar to those obtained using all 37 features. This indicated that our model was robust and not overly reliant on any single feature.\n\nAdditionally, we used a patient-stratified percentile bootstrapping method to generate 95% confidence intervals for the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis. This method helped to assess the stability and generalizability of our model's performance.\n\nTo rule out underfitting, we ensured that our models were complex enough to capture the underlying patterns in the data. Random forests are capable of handling non-linear relationships and interactions between features, making them well-suited for our dataset. Furthermore, we compared the performance of our models on both the training and testing sets, ensuring that they generalized well to unseen data.\n\nIn summary, we addressed the potential issues of overfitting and underfitting through careful feature selection, sensitivity analyses, and robust model evaluation techniques. These steps helped to ensure that our random forest models provided reliable and generalizable predictions of fibroglandular volume measures.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our models. One key approach was the use of random forests, which inherently provide regularization by averaging multiple decision trees. This method helps to reduce overfitting by decreasing the variance of the predictions.\n\nAdditionally, we conducted sensitivity analyses to examine the influence of participant characteristics and highly correlated features. For feature pairs with a Spearman correlation of 0.85 or higher, we randomly selected one feature to exclude from the model. This step helped to mitigate the risk of overfitting due to multicollinearity. We then retrained our random forest models using the remaining 25 features and found that the top selected features for fibroglandular volume prediction were similar, indicating the stability of our model.\n\nFurthermore, we stratified our analyses by menopausal status and included body mass index (BMI) in our random forest regression model to account for potential confounding variables. These steps ensured that our models were not overly reliant on specific subsets of the data, thereby enhancing their generalizability.\n\nIn summary, our use of random forests, sensitivity analyses, and stratification techniques collectively helped to prevent overfitting and improve the reliability of our predictions.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters used in our study are detailed within the publication. Specifically, the development of the deep learning convolutional neural network model is described, including the architecture and training process. The model utilized was an 11-layer fully convolutional VGG-like network, which was trained on digitized H&E whole slide images from 588 women. The performance metrics, such as the AUC for tissue classification, are also provided.\n\nThe study design, including the subdivision of the dataset into training and testing groups, is outlined, which gives insight into the optimization schedule. The training dataset consisted of 588 women with 687 biopsies, while the testing dataset included 264 women with 349 biopsies. This division is crucial for understanding the model's training and validation processes.\n\nFor those interested in the specific details of the model files and optimization parameters, supplementary information is available.

This ensures that the configurations and parameters are accessible to the research community under specified conditions.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a black-box system. To ensure interpretability, we utilized random forest models for predicting global and localized fibroglandular volume. Random forests are inherently interpretable due to their structure, which consists of multiple decision trees. Each tree provides a pathway of decisions based on feature importance, allowing us to trace the reasoning behind predictions.\n\nOne key aspect of interpretability in our model is the use of the Gini index. The Gini index plot, generated from the random forest output, measures the predictive importance of the features. This plot helps identify which features are most influential in the model's predictions, providing insights into the underlying biological processes. For instance, the top 10 features from each model prediction are listed, highlighting the most significant contributors to global and localized fibroglandular volume.\n\nAdditionally, the features extracted from the convolutional neural network (CNN) output are grouped into three main categories: global tissue quantities, morphology of the epithelial regions, and spatial arrangements of epithelial regions. This categorization aids in understanding how different aspects of tissue composition and structure contribute to the model's predictions. For example, spatial arrangements are analyzed using region adjacency graphs, including area-Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulation, which define areas of influence of epithelial regions in the image.\n\nThe use of these visual and statistical tools enhances the transparency of the model, making it possible to interpret the relationships between the input features and the output predictions. This interpretability is crucial for validating the model's reliability and for gaining biological insights from the data.",
  "model/output": "The model encompasses both classification and regression tasks. Initially, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was employed to classify breast biopsy tissue into three categories: epithelium, stroma, and fat. This classification was visually represented through whole slide image maps, with the model achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.95 for breast tissue classification.\n\nFollowing the generation of these maps, features were extracted from the CNN output. These features were categorized into three main groups: global tissue quantities, morphology of epithelial regions, and spatial arrangements of epithelial regions. To analyze spatial arrangements, region adjacency graphs, including area-Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulation, were utilized. The area-Voronoi diagram was particularly used to define areas of influence of epithelial regions in the images.\n\nFor the regression tasks, random forest models were trained using the extracted features. One model predicted global fibroglandular volume percentage, while another predicted localized fibroglandular volume percentage in the region of the biopsy target. The scikit-learn Python method was used for training these random forest models. The models were then applied to an independent testing set to predict fibroglandular volume measures.\n\nThe output from the random forest models included the Gini index plot, which measured the predictive importance of the features. The relationships between the predicted and radiologically quantified fibroglandular volume measures were assessed using Spearman rank correlations. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the influence of participant characteristics, such as body mass index (BMI) and menopausal status, on the observed findings. Additionally, highly correlated feature pairs were managed by excluding one feature randomly and retraining the models.\n\nIn an exploratory analysis, the extracted histologic features were examined for their potential to predict cancer status (benign vs. invasive biopsy diagnosis) among women with high and low fibroglandular volume. The patient population was stratified by fibroglandular volume using median cut points from the training population. A random forest classifier was trained to predict cancer status separately for women with high and low fibroglandular volume. The classifier's performance was assessed using area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) analysis. ROC curves were compared using a bootstrap method in the R package \u201cpROC\u201d.",

There is no mention of an executable, web server, virtual machine, or container instance being released for running the algorithm. The specifics of how the code can be requested or any associated licenses are not detailed.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the method involved several steps and analyses to ensure the robustness and validity of the findings. Initially, the study population was randomly subdivided into a training dataset, comprising 69% of the participants, and a testing dataset, comprising the remaining 31%. This split allowed for the training of the convolutional neural network model on one subset of data and its subsequent evaluation on an independent subset.\n\nThe convolutional neural network model was trained using digitized H&E whole slide images from the training set to generate maps of tissue composition, classifying the images into epithelial, stromal, and fat tissue. The performance of this model was assessed using the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), which was found to be 0.95, indicating high accuracy in tissue classification.\n\nFollowing the generation of whole slide image maps, 37 features were extracted from the convolutional neural network output.

These analyses included additional inclusion of body mass index (BMI) in the random forest regression model, stratification by menopausal status, and the exclusion of one feature from highly correlated feature pairs. The top selected features for fibroglandular volume prediction remained similar even when the number of features was reduced, leading to the presentation of results from random forest analyses including all 37 features.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we primarily focused on the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) as a key performance metric. For the classification of breast tissue into epithelial, stromal, and fat regions using our convolutional neural network, we achieved an AUC of 0.95, indicating strong model performance.\n\nFor the prediction of fibroglandular volume, we utilized random forest regression models. The performance of these models was assessed using Spearman rank correlations to evaluate the relationship between the predicted and actual fibroglandular volume measures.\n\nAdditionally, in an exploratory analysis aimed at predicting cancer status (benign vs. invasive biopsy diagnosis) among women with high and low fibroglandular volume, we employed the AUC of the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve. This metric was used to evaluate the performance of the random forest classifier. We also generated 95% confidence intervals using a patient-stratified percentile bootstrapping method to provide a measure of the uncertainty associated with our AUC estimates.\n\nThe use of AUC for both tissue classification and cancer status prediction aligns with common practices in the literature, ensuring that our performance metrics are representative and comparable to other studies in the field.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "Not applicable.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our model's performance included several statistical analyses to ensure the robustness and significance of our results. We used chi-square or Fisher\u2019s exact tests for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continuous variables to compare patient characteristics between the training and testing sets. These tests helped us understand if there were any significant differences between the datasets that could affect our model's performance.\n\nFor the random forest regression models used to predict global and localized fibroglandular volume, we employed the scikit-learn Python method. The performance of these models was assessed using Spearman rank correlations to evaluate the relationship between the predicted and radiologically quantified fibroglandular volume measures. This statistical measure provided a confidence interval for the correlation, indicating the strength and direction of the relationship.\n\nAdditionally, we conducted sensitivity analyses to examine the potential influence of participant characteristics, such as body mass index (BMI) and menopausal status, on our findings. We also assessed the impact of highly correlated histologic features by excluding one feature from each correlated pair and retraining the models. This approach helped us ensure that our results were not overly influenced by any single feature.\n\nThe area under the curve (AUC) for the classification of breast tissue was reported as 0.95, indicating a high level of accuracy in distinguishing between different tissue types. This metric provides a confidence interval that reflects the model's performance across various thresholds.\n\nOverall, our evaluation included multiple statistical tests and analyses to ensure that our results were statistically significant and that our model's performance was robust and reliable. The use of confidence intervals and correlation measures provided a comprehensive assessment of the model's accuracy and the significance of our findings.",
