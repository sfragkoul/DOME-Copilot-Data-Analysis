  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study consists of microelectrode recordings (MERs) from patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery for Parkinson's disease. Specifically, 131 microelectrode trajectories from 81 patients were analyzed. These trajectories passed through both the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). The patients had a mean age of 62.1 years and a mean disease duration of 10.3 years. The dataset includes a variety of clinical and demographic information, such as the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores and levodopa equivalent dosage (LED) before surgery.\n\nThe dataset was divided into two parts: a training dataset and a test dataset. The training dataset comprised 58 trajectories from 30 patients, containing 2678 stable MERs recorded in various regions, including the white matter before the STN, the STN dorsolateral oscillatory region (DLOR), the ventromedial non-oscillatory region (VMNR), the white matter after the STN, and the SNr. A subset of this dataset, containing 1720 MERs from the dorsal and ventral STN as well as the SNr, was used for the support vector machine (SVM) procedure. The training dataset was also used to find the optimal parameters for the hidden Markov model (HMM).\n\nThe test dataset consisted of 73 additional trajectories recorded from 51 other patients, yielding 4526 stable MERs. This dataset was used solely to test the robustness of the HMM detection procedure. The performance of the HMM was assessed using measures such as the mean OUT location error and the OUT transition error, which demonstrated improved accuracy compared to previous methods. The HMM procedure was designed to handle the heterogeneity of trajectories and to function effectively with novel data, making it suitable for real-time use during DBS surgery.",
  "dataset/splits": "In our study, we utilized multiple data splits to train and test our models effectively. For the support vector machine (SVM) classifier, we used 155 randomly selected samples from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and all 155 samples from the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). This resulted in a balanced dataset for training and testing the SVM.\n\nAdditionally, we employed a subset of 1720 microelectrode recordings (MERs) from the dorsal and ventral STN as well as the SNr for the SVM procedure. For the hidden Markov model (HMM), a training dataset consisting of 58 trajectories was used to find the optimal parameters. Furthermore, 73 additional trajectories recorded from 51 other patients, yielding 4526 stable MERs, were used solely to test the robustness of the HMM detection.\n\nThe distribution of data points in each split was designed to ensure comprehensive training and validation. The SVM classifier was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation, which involved dividing the dataset into 10 subsets, training on 9 subsets, and validating on the remaining subset, repeated 10 times. This method ensured that each data point was used for both training and validation.\n\nFor the HMM, the leave-one-out cross-validation approach was employed, where the parameters were estimated from 57 trajectories and validated on the remaining one, repeated for each trajectory in the training dataset. This method provided a robust evaluation of the HMM's performance.\n\nIn summary, our study involved multiple data splits, including a balanced dataset for SVM training and testing, a subset of MERs for SVM procedure, and separate training and test datasets for the HMM. The distribution of data points in each split was carefully designed to ensure thorough training and validation.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets used in this study were divided into two main parts: a training dataset and a test dataset. The training dataset consisted of 58 trajectories obtained from 30 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, yielding a total of 2678 stable microelectrode recordings (MERs). These MERs were recorded in various regions, including the white matter before the subthalamic nucleus (STN), the STN dorsolateral oscillatory region (DLOR), and the STN ventromedial non-oscillatory region (VMNR), as well as the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr).\n\nThe test dataset was composed of 73 additional trajectories recorded from 51 other patients, resulting in 4526 stable MERs. This dataset was used solely to test the robustness of the hidden Markov model (HMM) detection procedure.\n\nTo ensure independence between the training and test sets, the trajectories in each set were obtained from different patients. This approach helps to prevent data leakage and ensures that the model's performance is evaluated on truly unseen data. The training dataset was used to find the optimal parameters for the HMM and to train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The test dataset, being independent, was used to assess the generalizability and robustness of the HMM procedure.\n\nThe distribution of the datasets in this study is designed to reflect real-world scenarios where the model needs to perform reliably on new, unseen data. This approach is crucial for developing a computational method that can be used in the operating room without continual adjustment. The use of independent training and test sets aligns with best practices in machine learning, ensuring that the model's performance is not overestimated due to data leakage or overfitting.",
  "dataset/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in our study is the Hidden Markov Model (HMM). This algorithm is not new; it has been previously used in similar contexts. However, our implementation of the HMM is novel in that it incorporates additional features and improvements specifically tailored for real-time detection of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) exit during deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery.\n\nThe HMM procedure in our study takes the set of features extracted from the raw microelectrode recordings (MERs) as input and provides output clustering in real time. This is an advancement over previous HMM procedures, which did not include the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) as a possible state and did not utilize the high frequencies (100\u2013150 Hz) of the power spectrum. Our enhanced HMM procedure discriminates between the STN and SNr using the \"100\u2013150 Hz/5\u201325 Hz Power Ratio\" and normalized root mean square (NRMS) features, along with the depth of the trajectory.\n\nThe reason this work was not published in a machine-learning journal is that the primary focus of our study is on the application of these machine-learning techniques to neurophysiological data for clinical purposes, specifically in the context of DBS surgery for Parkinson\u2019s disease. The innovation lies in the application and adaptation of existing machine-learning algorithms to solve a specific medical problem, rather than in the development of a new machine-learning algorithm per se. Our goal is to demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of real-time, high-accuracy electrophysiological detection of the ventral STN border, which is crucial for optimizing therapeutic outcomes and avoiding psychiatric complications in DBS surgery.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model described in this publication does not function as a meta-predictor. Instead, it employs a support vector machine (SVM) and a hidden Markov model (HMM) sequentially to achieve its goals.\n\nThe SVM is initially used to identify the most informative features for discriminating between the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). This involves using measurements in both the time and frequency domains, specifically the normalized root mean square (NRMS) and the \"100\u2013150 Hz/5\u201325 Hz Power Ratio,\" along with their class labels (STN or SNr) for a set of microelectrode recordings (MERs). The SVM's role is to verify the reliability of these features for discrimination and is not used in real-time applications.\n\nFollowing the SVM analysis, the HMM is utilized. The HMM takes the features extracted from the raw data, including the NRMS and power spectral density (PSD) features, as well as the trajectory history, to provide real-time clustering and decision-making. This model is designed to detect the STN exit, delineating the borders between the STN and SNr, even in cases without a white matter gap. The HMM's performance is evaluated using measures such as the mean OUT location error and the OUT transition error, demonstrating its robustness and accuracy in novel data.\n\nThe training dataset for the HMM consists of 58 trajectories, with parameters estimated using a leave-one-out cross-validation approach. Additionally, 73 other trajectories from different patients are used to test the model's reliability, showing that it can function effectively with completely novel data. The independence of the training data is ensured through this cross-validation method, where each trajectory's parameters are estimated from the remaining trajectories.\n\nIn summary, the model does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input in a meta-predictor sense. Instead, it sequentially applies SVM for feature selection and HMM for real-time decision-making, with clear independence of the training data ensured through cross-validation techniques.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the machine-learning algorithms employed in our study, data encoding and preprocessing were crucial steps to ensure accurate and reliable results. The primary data used were micro-electrode recordings (MERs) from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). These recordings were initially processed to calculate the Root Mean Square (RMS) values, which were then normalized by the pre-STN (white matter) baseline RMS to create the normalized RMS (NRMS). This normalization step was essential to mitigate the effects of electrode properties, such as impedance, on the RMS values.\n\nIn addition to the NRMS, the power spectral density (PSD) of the MERs was analyzed. The PSD was examined across the 5\u2013300 Hz frequency range, which was divided into approximately logarithmically spaced bands. For each band, the mean power was calculated for each MER, and the differences in mean power between the STN and SNr were evaluated. This analysis helped identify the frequency bands with the largest differences between the two regions, with a particular focus on the \"100\u2013150 Hz/5\u201325 Hz Power Ratio\" feature.\n\nThe features extracted from the NRMS and PSD were then used as inputs for the machine-learning algorithms. For the support vector machine (SVM) procedure, these features, along with their class labels (STN or SNr), were used to train the classifier. The SVM analysis confirmed the utility of the \"100\u2013150 Hz/5\u201325 Hz Power Ratio\" for discriminating between the STN and SNr, achieving an overall classification accuracy rate of 97.6% through 10-fold cross-validation.\n\nFor the hidden Markov model (HMM) procedure, the features extracted from the raw data, along with the trajectory history, were used as inputs. The HMM procedure was designed to provide real-time clustering and decision-making regarding electrode placement. The inclusion of trajectory history allowed the HMM to account for recording glitches that might otherwise be misclassified by methods like SVM. The HMM parameters, including transition and emission matrices, were estimated using a leave-one-out cross-validation approach on the training dataset.\n\nThe preprocessing and encoding steps ensured that the machine-learning algorithms could effectively discriminate between the STN and SNr, even in the absence of a white matter gap between these regions. This approach enabled reliable detection of the STN exit during deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery, with minimal errors and high accuracy.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized two primary features for our models: the normalized Root Mean Square (NRMS) and the \"100\u2013150 Hz/5\u201325 Hz Power Ratio.\" These features were derived from the micro-electrode recordings (MERs) and were used as input parameters for both the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the Hidden Markov Model (HMM).\n\nThe selection of these parameters was driven by their ability to discriminate between the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). The NRMS was normalized by the pre-STN (white matter) baseline RMS to account for variations in electrode properties. The power ratio feature was identified through an analysis of the power spectral density (PSD) in the 5\u2013300 Hz domain, which revealed significant differences between the STN and SNr. By dividing this range into logarithmically spaced bands and evaluating the mean power differences, we identified the 100\u2013150 Hz/5\u201325 Hz Power Ratio as the most discriminative feature.\n\nThe SVM procedure was initially used to verify the utility of these features. It was trained and tested on a dataset of 1720 MERs from the dorsal and ventral STN as well as SNr, achieving a high classification accuracy. This confirmed that the selected features were robust for discriminating between the STN and SNr.\n\nSubsequently, the HMM procedure was designed to use these features in real-time, along with the trajectory history, to detect the STN exit. The HMM parameters, including transition and emission matrices, were estimated using a leave-one-out cross-validation approach on a training dataset of 58 trajectories. This method ensured that the model could generalize well to new data.\n\nIn summary, the model uses two key parameters: NRMS and the \"100\u2013150 Hz/5\u201325 Hz Power Ratio.\" These parameters were selected based on their discriminative power, as validated by the SVM procedure, and their effectiveness in real-time detection, as demonstrated by the HMM procedure.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized two primary features as input for our models. These features were the normalized Root Mean Square (NRMS) and the \"100\u2013150 Hz/5\u201325 Hz Power Ratio.\" The NRMS was derived from the multi-unit activity recorded by the microelectrode at each electrode depth and was normalized by the pre-STN (white matter) baseline RMS. The power ratio feature was calculated by dividing the power in the 100\u2013150 Hz frequency band by the power in the 5\u201325 Hz frequency band, which was identified as a significant discriminator between the STN and SNr regions.\n\nFeature selection was indeed performed to identify the most informative features for discriminating between the STN and SNr. This process involved using a support vector machine (SVM) to evaluate various features and determine which ones provided the most discriminative power. The SVM analysis confirmed the utility of the \"100\u2013150 Hz/5\u201325 Hz Power Ratio\" as a robust feature for distinguishing between the STN and SNr. The feature selection was conducted using the training dataset only, ensuring that the selected features were not biased by the test data. This approach allowed us to focus on the most relevant features for real-time detection during deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study involved a support vector machine (SVM) and a hidden Markov model (HMM), each with its own set of parameters and training procedures.\n\nThe SVM was used to classify microelectrode recordings (MERs) from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). The number of parameters in the SVM was not excessively large compared to the number of training points. The training dataset consisted of 1720 MERs, which provided a sufficient number of samples to train the SVM effectively. To ensure that overfitting was not an issue, 10-fold cross-validation was performed. This technique involves dividing the dataset into 10 subsets, training the model on 9 subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated 10 times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. The average performance across all folds was used to evaluate the model's generalization ability, thereby mitigating the risk of overfitting.\n\nThe HMM, on the other hand, was designed to provide real-time clustering of MER features. The HMM parameters, including transition and emission matrices, were estimated using a leave-one-out cross-validation approach. This method involves training the model on all but one trajectory and then testing it on the left-out trajectory. This process is repeated for each trajectory in the dataset, ensuring that the model's performance is evaluated on novel data. The HMM's ability to handle heterogeneous trajectories and its robustness to different thresholds further indicate that underfitting was not a concern. The model demonstrated high accuracy in detecting the STN exit, with minimal errors and misses, even when applied to completely novel data.\n\nIn summary, the fitting methods employed in this study were designed to balance the complexity of the models with the available data. Cross-validation techniques were used to ensure that the models generalized well to new data, ruling out both overfitting and underfitting.",
  "optimization/regularization": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The models employed in our study, specifically the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the Hidden Markov Model (HMM), offer varying degrees of interpretability.\n\nThe SVM classifier used in our analysis is a supervised learning model designed to solve classification problems. It operates by finding a hyperplane that best separates the data into different classes. In our case, the SVM was used to discriminate between the Subthalamic Nucleus (STN) and the Substantia Nigra pars reticulata (SNr) using features such as the normalized Root Mean Square (NRMS) and the \"100\u2013150 Hz/5\u201325 Hz Power Ratio.\" The decision boundary created by the SVM is linear, which means it is relatively straightforward to interpret. The support vectors, which are the data points closest to the decision boundary, play a crucial role in defining this boundary. By examining these support vectors, one can gain insights into which data points are most influential in the classification process. This transparency allows for a clear understanding of how the SVM makes its decisions, making it less of a black-box model.\n\nOn the other hand, the HMM is a probabilistic model that is used for sequential data. It operates by assuming that the system being modeled is a Markov process with hidden states. The HMM takes features extracted from the raw data as input and provides real-time clustering of these features. While the HMM is powerful for modeling sequential data, it is inherently more complex and less transparent than the SVM. The HMM's parameters, such as the transition and emission matrices, are estimated from the data and are used to make predictions about the hidden states. However, interpreting these matrices can be challenging, as they represent probabilistic relationships between states and observations. Despite this complexity, the HMM's ability to incorporate trajectory history and make real-time decisions makes it a valuable tool for tasks such as detecting the STN exit during Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) surgery.\n\nIn summary, the SVM classifier used in our study is relatively transparent, with a clear decision boundary defined by support vectors. The HMM, while more complex, provides real-time decision-making capabilities but is less interpretable due to its probabilistic nature. Both models contribute to the overall goal of accurately discriminating between the STN and SNr, with the SVM offering more interpretability and the HMM providing real-time functionality.",
  "model/output": "The model employs both classification and real-time detection techniques. Initially, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used to discriminate between the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) based on specific features derived from microelectrode recordings (MERs). This SVM procedure is a classification task, aiming to accurately label the regions as either STN or SNr. The classification performance was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation, achieving an overall accuracy rate of 97.6%.\n\nFollowing the SVM analysis, a hidden Markov model (HMM) was utilized to enable real-time detection of the STN exit during deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. The HMM takes into account both the MER features and the trajectory history to make real-time decisions about electrode placement. This part of the model focuses on detecting transitions, such as from STN to SNr or white matter, in real-time, which is more aligned with a detection or sequence labeling task rather than traditional regression.\n\nThe HMM's performance was assessed using two primary measures: the mean OUT location error and the OUT transition error. The mean OUT location error indicates the difference between the human expert's classification of the transition location and the HMM's inferred location. The OUT transition error is defined as an OUT location error greater than 1 mm. The HMM demonstrated high accuracy and reliability, with a mean OUT location error of 0.1 \u00b1 0.34 mm on the training dataset and 0.04 \u00b1 0.18 mm on a novel dataset, achieving 97% and 94% hits, respectively.\n\nOverall, the model combines classification techniques to identify regions and real-time detection methods to accurately determine the STN exit during surgery, providing a robust solution for improving the precision of DBS procedures.",
  "model/duration": "The model's execution time is quite efficient, making it practical for real-time use during deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. It takes approximately 99 milliseconds to process a new trajectory and determine whether it is within the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or not. Subsequent micro-electrode recordings (MERs) are analyzed in less than a millisecond per MER. This rapid processing speed ensures that the model can provide real-time decisions during the implant process, allowing for immediate adjustments and accurate electrode placement. The efficiency of the model is crucial for its application in surgical settings, where timely and precise information is essential.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the method involved several key steps and measures to ensure its robustness and accuracy. The performance of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) was assessed using two primary measures: the mean OUT location error and the OUT transition error. The OUT location error is defined as the difference between the location classified by a human expert and the location inferred by the HMM, both measured in millimeters of estimated distance to the target. The OUT transition error is defined as an OUT location error greater than 1 mm. Hits were counted as the number of correctly detected OUT transitions, while misses were the number of OUT transitions that the HMM procedure did not detect.\n\nThe HMM was initially evaluated on a training dataset consisting of 58 trajectories. The mean OUT location error for this dataset was 0.1 \u00b1 0.34 mm, with only 2 misses out of 58 trajectories, resulting in a 97% hit rate. This demonstrated the method's high accuracy in detecting the STN exit.\n\nTo further validate the method's robustness, it was tested on a novel dataset consisting of 73 trajectories from 51 different patients. The HMM procedure identified the STN exit with an error of 0.04 \u00b1 0.18 mm. Using the 1 mm threshold, the OUT transition error for the novel dataset resulted in 4 misses out of 73 trajectories, achieving a 94% hit rate. This performance was superior to previous methods, which had higher error rates and fewer hits.\n\nAdditionally, the method's robustness was tested using different threshold values. Thresholds of 0.5 mm and 0.15 mm produced similar quantitative results, with 4 and 7 misses out of 73 trajectories, respectively. This demonstrated that the method is reliable across various threshold settings.\n\nThe evaluation also included the use of a support vector machine (SVM) to verify the reliability of the \"100\u2013150 Hz/5\u201325 Hz Power Ratio\" as a feature for discriminating between the STN and SNr populations. The SVM classifier achieved an overall classification accuracy rate of 97.6% using 10-fold cross-validation, further confirming the utility of the power ratio feature.\n\nIn summary, the method was evaluated through a combination of training and novel datasets, different threshold settings, and cross-validation techniques. The results consistently demonstrated high accuracy and robustness in detecting the STN exit, making it a reliable tool for use in deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery.",
  "evaluation/measure": "The performance of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) was evaluated using two primary measures: the mean OUT location error and the OUT transition error. The mean OUT location error quantifies the difference between the location of the transition as defined by a neurophysiologist and the location inferred by the HMM, both measured in millimeters of estimated distance to the target. This metric provides a direct comparison between human expert classification and the automated HMM procedure.\n\nThe OUT transition error is defined as an OUT location error greater than 1 millimeter. This measure helps to identify instances where the HMM's inference deviates significantly from the expert's classification, indicating potential areas for improvement in the model's accuracy.\n\nAdditionally, the performance was assessed in terms of hits and misses. Hits refer to the number of correctly detected OUT transitions, while misses represent the number of OUT transitions that the HMM procedure did not detect, according to the human expert's decision. These metrics together provide a comprehensive evaluation of the HMM's ability to accurately detect transitions in the trajectories.\n\nThe reported performance metrics are representative of the literature, as they include both quantitative error measures and qualitative assessments of detection accuracy. The use of mean OUT location error and OUT transition error aligns with standard practices in evaluating the performance of automated detection algorithms in neurophysiological studies. The inclusion of hits and misses further ensures that the evaluation is thorough and considers both the precision and recall of the HMM procedure.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "The evaluation of our method involved a comparison with previous approaches to assess its performance. Specifically, we compared our hidden Markov model (HMM) procedure with earlier methods that relied on root mean square (RMS) values. These previous methods were effective in identifying transitions from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) to the white matter but were less accurate for direct STN to substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) transitions.\n\nTo validate our approach, we used a training dataset consisting of 58 trajectories from 30 Parkinson's disease patients. This dataset included microelectrode recordings (MERs) from various regions, such as the white matter before the STN, the STN dorsolateral oscillatory region, and the SNr. The performance of our HMM was evaluated using two primary measures: the mean OUT location error and the OUT transition error. The mean OUT location error was defined as the difference between the human expert's classification of the transition location and the HMM-inferred location, measured in millimeters. The OUT transition error was defined as an OUT location error greater than 1 mm.\n\nOur HMM procedure demonstrated superior performance compared to previous methods. On the training dataset, the mean OUT location error was 0.1 \u00b1 0.34 mm, with only 2 misses out of 58 trajectories, resulting in a 97% hit rate. This performance was further validated on a novel dataset consisting of 73 trajectories from 51 patients. The HMM procedure identified the STN exit with an error of 0.04 \u00b1 0.18 mm and committed 4 misses out of 73 trajectories, achieving a 94% hit rate. This performance was better than that of previous HMM procedures and Bayesian methods, which had higher error rates and fewer hits.\n\nAdditionally, we tested the robustness of our HMM procedure by evaluating it with different threshold values. Thresholds of 0.5 mm and 0.15 mm produced similar quantitative results, further confirming the reliability of our method. These comparisons highlight the improved accuracy and robustness of our HMM procedure in detecting STN exits, particularly in cases involving direct transitions to the SNr.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) procedure included two primary performance metrics: the mean OUT location error and the OUT transition error. The mean OUT location error was reported with a standard deviation, providing a measure of variability around the mean error. For the training dataset, the mean OUT location error was 0.1 \u00b1 0.34 mm, indicating a low average error with some variability. The OUT transition error, defined as an OUT location error greater than 1 mm, was also assessed. The HMM procedure demonstrated high accuracy, with 97% hits and only 2 misses out of 58 trajectories in the training dataset.\n\nFor the novel dataset, consisting of 73 trajectories from 51 patients, the HMM procedure showed an even lower mean OUT location error of 0.04 \u00b1 0.18 mm. The OUT transition error for this dataset resulted in 4 misses out of 73 trajectories, achieving a 94% hit rate. This performance was compared to previous methods, which had higher error rates and fewer hits. The statistical significance of these results was established with a criterion set at P < 0.05, ensuring that the observed differences were not due to random chance.\n\nThe robustness of the HMM procedure was further validated by testing it with different threshold values. Thresholds of 0.5 mm and 0.15 mm produced similar quantitative results, with 4 and 7 misses out of 73 trajectories, respectively. This consistency across different thresholds reinforces the reliability of the HMM procedure.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics included confidence intervals in the form of standard deviations, and the results were statistically significant. The HMM procedure demonstrated superior performance compared to previous methods, with low error rates and high accuracy in detecting the STN exit.",
