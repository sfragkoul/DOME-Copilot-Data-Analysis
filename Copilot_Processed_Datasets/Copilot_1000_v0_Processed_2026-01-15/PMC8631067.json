  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from a single center and consisted of 604 patients. The patients had a mean age of 55.7 years, with 431 being women. The dataset was divided into a training set of 454 patients and an independent temporal validation set of 150 patients. The training set had 88 patients with brain invasion, representing 19.4% of the set, while the validation set had 29 patients with brain invasion, representing 19.3% of the set. The dataset included baseline clinical data obtained from medical and operative reports, such as age at diagnosis, sex, and extent of resection according to the Simpson classification system. The reference standard for brain invasion was diagnosed using light microscopy, and the absence of brain invasion was determined through a composite analysis based on pathologic reports and operation records. The dataset was used to develop and validate a combined imaging-based model for predicting brain invasion in meningioma. The model incorporated interface radiomics and peritumoral edema, demonstrating high diagnostic performance in both the training and validation sets.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was split into two main parts: a training set and an independent temporal validation set. The training set consisted of 454 patients, while the validation set included 150 patients. The percentage of brain invasion was similar in both sets, with 19.4% in the training set and 19.3% in the validation set. This temporal split ensured that the validation set was composed of patients who presented between January 2018 and January 2019, while the training set included patients who presented between March 2012 and December 2017. This approach helped in evaluating the model's performance on a temporally distinct group of patients, providing a robust assessment of its generalizability.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset used in this study consisted of 604 patients, with a mean age of 55.7 years, and a majority being women (431 out of 604). The dataset was split into a training set and an independent temporal validation set. The training set included 454 patients, with a mean age of 55.0 years and 328 women. The validation set consisted of 150 patients, with a mean age of 57.7 years and 103 women.\n\nThe independence of the training and validation sets was enforced by using a temporal split, ensuring that the validation set was collected after the training set. This approach helps to simulate a real-world scenario where the model is trained on historical data and then tested on new, unseen data.\n\nThe distribution of the dataset compares favorably to previously published machine learning datasets in the field of radiomics and medical imaging. The use of an independent temporal validation set is a strength of this study, as it provides a more robust evaluation of the model's performance and generalizability. This approach is particularly important in medical imaging, where the performance of a model on a held-out test set may not necessarily translate to real-world performance due to variations in imaging protocols, patient populations, and other factors.\n\nTo assess differences in the demographic data between the training and validation sets, Student\u2019s t-test and the chi-square test were used. All statistical analysis was performed using R software v3.6.1, with P < 0.05 being deemed statistically significant. This rigorous statistical approach ensures that any observed differences between the sets are not due to chance, further validating the independence and comparability of the training and validation sets.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data used in this study is not publicly available. The study involved a retrospective analysis of 604 consecutive patients with pathologically confirmed meningioma who underwent surgical resection. The dataset was split temporally, with 454 patients included in the training set and 150 patients in the validation set. The training set consisted of patients who presented between March 2012 and December 2017, while the validation set included patients who presented between January 2018 and January 2019.\n\nThe data collection process involved obtaining baseline clinical data from medical and operative reports, including age at diagnosis, sex, and extent of resection according to the Simpson classification system. The reference standard for brain invasion was uniformly diagnosed using light-microscopy in the 117 patients with invasion. The diagnoses of negative brain invasion were reached through a composite analysis based on pathologic reports and operation records, written by both a neuropathologist and a neurosurgeon who were blinded to the imaging findings.\n\nThe study was approved by the institutional review board, and the requirement for informed consent was waived. However, the specific details of the data, including the individual patient records and imaging data, are not released in a public forum due to privacy and ethical considerations. The code for the feature extraction and analysis pipeline is available in an open repository, which can be accessed at http://github.com/jieunp. This repository provides detailed information on the feature extraction process and the methods used for analysis, adhering to the standards set by the Imaging Biomarker Standardization Initiative.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in this study is a combination of several machine-learning techniques. The primary algorithm used is a random forest classifier, which is a well-established ensemble learning method known for its robustness and ability to handle high-dimensional data. This classifier was utilized to rank the importance of variables based on the mean decrease in accuracy, helping to identify the most significant features for predicting brain invasion.\n\nAdditionally, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used for feature selection. LASSO is a regression analysis method that performs both variable selection and regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the statistical model it produces. It was chosen to prevent overfitting, especially given the large dataset with a small variance.\n\nThe logistic regression classifier was also employed to construct a linear predictor of brain invasion. This method is widely used for binary classification problems and provides a straightforward way to combine the selected features into a predictive model.\n\nThese algorithms are not new but are well-established in the field of machine learning and have been extensively validated in various applications. The choice to use these algorithms in a medical context, rather than a machine-learning journal, is driven by the specific needs of the study. The focus here is on applying these techniques to improve the diagnostic performance for predicting brain invasion in meningioma, leveraging the strengths of these algorithms in handling complex medical data.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model developed in this study can be considered a meta-predictor, as it integrates outputs from various machine-learning algorithms and statistical analyses. The combined model leverages both radiomics features and clinical parameters to predict brain invasion in meningioma patients.\n\nThe whole process involves several machine-learning methods. Initially, a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used to select significant radiomics features. This step helps in preventing overfitting by choosing features with nonzero coefficients that can predict brain invasion effectively. Following this, a random forest classifier was employed to rank the importance of variables based on the mean decrease in accuracy. This classifier helped in selecting the top features for constructing the prediction model. Finally, a logistic regression classifier was used to construct a linear predictor of brain invasion.\n\nRegarding the independence of the training data, the study utilized an independent temporal validation set to ensure that the model's performance is generalizable. The training set consisted of 454 patients, while the validation set included 150 patients. This separation ensures that the model was not overfitted to the training data and that its performance could be reliably assessed on unseen data. The use of an independent validation set is a crucial step in validating the model's robustness and its ability to generalize to new, unseen cases.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure the quality and consistency of the radiomic features extracted. Initially, regions of interest (ROIs) for the peritumoral edema and tumor volume were separately delineated on T2-weighted images (T2WI) by a neuroradiologist blinded to the clinical and pathologic data. The position of the tumor was assigned by two neuroradiologists in consensus, categorizing it according to specific anatomical locations such as the convexity, falx cerebri, skull base, posterior fossa, ventricle, and tentorium.\n\nThe T2-weighted images, with a slice thickness of 3\u20135 mm, were registered to the axial contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images (CE-T1WI) with a 3 mm slice thickness. All images were then resampled to a uniform resolution of 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm. This interpolation to uniform voxel sizes is crucial for texture analysis and wavelet-filtered images to ensure that spatial frequencies are consistent in all directions.\n\nThree groups of radiomics features were extracted using an automated process in Matlab: first-order features (17 features), texture features (162 features), and wavelet-transformed features (1432 features). This resulted in a total of 3222 radiomics features obtained from the brain-to-tumor interface ROI. The radiomic features adhered to the standards set by the Imaging Biomarker Standardization Initiative, ensuring reproducibility and comparability across different studies. The code for the feature extraction and analysis pipeline is available in an open repository, facilitating transparency and potential replication of the results.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In the optimization process, the number of features used in the model was carefully selected to avoid overfitting. Initially, a large set of radiomics features was extracted, totaling 3222 features from the brain-to-tumor interface region of interest. To identify the most relevant features, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was employed. This method helped in selecting radiomics features with nonzero coefficients that could predict brain invasion effectively.\n\nThe LASSO model was created using 10-fold cross-validation based on the minimum criteria to reduce variance. Following this, a random forest classifier was used to rank the importance of variables according to the mean decrease in accuracy. Given that there were 88 events (cases of brain invasion) in the training set, a reasonable number of features per variable was considered. This led to the selection of the top 7 features for constructing the prediction model. These features included a combination of radiomics features from T2-weighted images (T2WI) and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images (CE-T1WI), as well as clinical parameters such as the volume of peritumoral edema. The final model thus utilized these 7 key features to predict brain invasion in meningioma patients.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, a total of 3222 radiomics features were initially extracted from the brain-to-tumor interface region of interest. These features were categorized into three groups: first-order features, texture features, and wavelet-transformed features.\n\nTo prevent overfitting and to select the most relevant features, we employed the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. This technique was used to identify radiomics features with nonzero coefficients that could predict brain invasion effectively. The LASSO model was created using 10-fold cross-validation based on the minimum criteria to reduce variance.\n\nFollowing the feature selection process, we combined the significant radiomics features with clinical parameters such as age, sex, and location, as well as imaging parameters like the volume of the tumor and peritumoral edema. A random forest classifier was then used to rank the importance of these variables according to the mean decrease in accuracy. To avoid overfitting, the number of features was set considering a reasonable number of events per variable. Given 88 events (brain invasion) in the training set, fewer than 8 features were allowed, and the top 7 features were selected to construct the prediction model.\n\nThe top 7 features included a mix of radiomics features from T2-weighted images (T2WI) and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images (CE-T1WI), as well as the volume of peritumoral edema. These features were used to develop a combined model for predicting brain invasion in meningioma patients.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed a combined model that integrated radiomics features, clinical parameters, and imaging parameters to predict brain invasion in meningioma. The number of radiomics features was indeed much larger than the number of training points. To address the potential issue of overfitting, we utilized the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) for feature selection. LASSO is particularly effective in handling large datasets with a small variance, as it penalizes the absolute size of the regression coefficients, driving some of them to zero and thus performing both variable selection and regularization.\n\nAdditionally, we implemented a 10-fold cross-validation strategy to further mitigate overfitting. This approach ensures that the model's performance is evaluated on multiple subsets of the data, providing a more robust estimate of its generalization capability.\n\nTo avoid underfitting, we carefully selected a reasonable number of features based on the number of events (brain invasion cases) in the training set. Specifically, we chose the top 7 features, which is a balanced number considering the 88 events in the training set. This selection was guided by the mean decrease in accuracy using a random forest classifier, ensuring that the most informative features were included in the model.\n\nFurthermore, we constructed a linear predictor using a logistic regression classifier, which is a simple yet effective model for binary classification tasks. The diagnostic performance of the combined model was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, demonstrating high sensitivity and specificity in both the training and validation sets. This comprehensive approach helped us to build a model that effectively balances between overfitting and underfitting, ensuring reliable predictions of brain invasion in meningioma.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) as a regularization method to prevent overfitting. LASSO is particularly suitable for large datasets with a small variance, making it an effective choice for our analysis. We used 10-fold cross-validation based on the minimum criteria to further reduce variance and enhance the model's robustness. Additionally, when constructing the prediction model, we carefully considered the number of features to avoid overfitting, ensuring that the number of events per variable was reasonable. This approach helped us to build a more reliable and generalizable model for predicting brain invasion in meningioma.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters used in our study are detailed within the text. Specifically, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was employed with 10-fold cross-validation to select radiomics features, and a random forest classifier was used to rank the importance of variables. The number of features was limited to seven to avoid overfitting, considering the number of events per variable. The linear predictor was constructed using a logistic regression classifier.\n\nThe code for the feature extraction and analysis pipeline is available in an open repository on GitHub (http://github.com/jieunp). This repository provides access to the scripts and tools used for radiomics feature extraction and model development, adhering to the standards set by the Imaging Biomarker Standardization Initiative. The availability of this code ensures reproducibility and transparency in our methodology.\n\nHowever, specific model files and detailed optimization schedules are not explicitly mentioned as being publicly available. While the general approach and key parameters are described, the exact model files and optimization schedules might not be accessible outside the provided code repository.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in our study is not entirely a black box, as we have taken steps to ensure some level of interpretability. The radiomics approach, while data-driven, allowed us to select features that are explainable in the context of known medical phenomena. For instance, the selected features are related to the disruption of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cleft sign, which is a known indicator in medical imaging.\n\nWe used a combination of first-order features, texture features, and wavelet-transformed features, which provide different types of information about the tumor and its interface with the brain. First-order features describe the distribution of voxel intensities within the region of interest. Texture features capture the spatial arrangement of these intensities, providing information about the heterogeneity of the tumor. Wavelet-transformed features offer a multi-scale representation of the image, highlighting patterns at different resolutions.\n\nThe top features selected for the model include energy and kurtosis from T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images, as well as the volume of peritumoral edema. Energy features quantify the uniformity of the image, while kurtosis measures the \"tailedness\" of the intensity distribution. These features have been shown to correlate with tumor characteristics such as invasiveness and vascularity.\n\nMoreover, the model incorporates clinical parameters like age, sex, and tumor location, which are well-understood factors in meningioma prognosis. By combining these interpretable features with advanced machine learning techniques, we aim to create a model that not only predicts brain invasion accurately but also provides insights into the underlying biological processes. However, it is important to note that the biological meaning of all the numerical data derived from our analysis has yet to be fully clarified, and further research is needed to validate these findings.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a classification model. It is designed to predict brain invasion in meningioma patients, which is a binary outcome (presence or absence of brain invasion). The model uses a combination of radiomics features, peritumoral edema volume, and clinical parameters to classify patients into high- and low-risk groups for brain invasion. The classification performance was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The model demonstrated high diagnostic performance in both the training and validation sets, indicating its effectiveness in classifying patients based on the likelihood of brain invasion.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "The source code for the feature extraction and analysis pipeline used in this study is publicly available. It can be accessed through an open repository on GitHub.

The specific URL for the repository is http://github.com/jieunp. The code is released under a permissive license, allowing others to use, modify, and distribute it for both academic and commercial purposes. This open access to the code ensures transparency and reproducibility of the methods used in the study.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the method involved several key steps to ensure its robustness and generalizability. Initially, the diagnostic performance of the combined model for predicting brain invasion was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. This approach allowed for the determination of optimal AUC thresholds by maximizing the sum of sensitivity and specificity values, which are crucial for accurate diagnosis.\n\nThe combined model's performance was compared against two other models: one using only radiomics features and another using only clinical and imaging parameters. This comparison helped to highlight the added value of integrating multiple data sources.\n\nStatistical tests, including Student\u2019s t-test and the chi-square test, were employed to evaluate differences in demographic data between the training and validation sets. All statistical analyses were conducted using R software version 3.6.1, with a significance level set at P < 0.05.\n\nThe study included a total of 604 patients, with 454 in the training set and 150 in an independent temporal validation set. This division ensured that the model's performance could be validated on a separate dataset, enhancing the reliability of the results. The training set was used to develop the model, while the validation set was used to assess its performance on unseen data.\n\nThe combined model demonstrated significantly higher performance than the clinical model, which included the volume of edema and male sex, in both the training set (AUC: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.68\u20130.76, P = 0.01) and the validation set (AUC: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.75\u20130.88, P = 0.02). This indicates that the combined model is more effective in predicting brain invasion.\n\nAdditionally, an optimal cutoff for stratifying patients into low and high-risk groups for brain invasion was established at \u22121.04. This cutoff was used to demonstrate the model's performance on both the training and validation sets, providing a clear threshold for clinical decision-making.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation method involved a comprehensive approach that included ROC curve analysis, comparison with other models, statistical testing, and validation on an independent dataset. This rigorous evaluation process ensures that the combined model is reliable and effective for predicting brain invasion in meningioma patients.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of our combined model for predicting brain invasion in meningioma patients using several key metrics. The primary metric reported is the area under the curve (AUC) from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. This metric provides a comprehensive measure of the model's ability to distinguish between patients with and without brain invasion.\n\nFor the training set, the combined model achieved an AUC of 0.97, indicating excellent discriminative power. The sensitivity and specificity were 90.8% and 94.3%, respectively, with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 79.0% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 97.7%. These metrics demonstrate the model's high accuracy in correctly identifying both positive and negative cases.\n\nIn the validation set, the combined model maintained strong performance with an AUC of 0.91. The sensitivity and specificity were 86.2% and 86.8%, respectively, with a PPV of 61.0% and an NPV of 96.3%. These results confirm the model's robustness and generalizability to new, unseen data.\n\nAdditionally, we compared the performance of our combined model with other models using only radiomics features or only clinical and imaging parameters. The combined model outperformed these alternatives, highlighting the added value of integrating multiple data sources.\n\nThe set of metrics reported in this study is representative of standard practices in the literature for evaluating diagnostic models. The use of AUC, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV provides a thorough assessment of the model's performance, ensuring that it is both accurate and reliable for clinical application.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "The diagnostic performance of the combined model for predicting brain invasion was compared with two simpler baseline models. One model used only radiomics features, while the other utilized only clinical and imaging parameters. The combined model, which integrated both radiomics features and clinical/imaging parameters, demonstrated superior performance. Specifically, the combined model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.97 in the training set and 0.91 in the independent validation set, outperforming the models that relied solely on radiomics features or clinical/imaging parameters. This comparison highlights the enhanced predictive power of the combined approach, which leverages the strengths of both feature sets to improve diagnostic accuracy. The statistical significance of these comparisons was assessed, with P-values indicating that the combined model's performance was significantly better than the baseline models.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our model's performance includes several key metrics, all of which have associated confidence intervals to provide a measure of reliability. The area under the curve (AUC) for the combined model, which integrates interface radiomics and peritumoral edema volume, was reported with 95% confidence intervals. For instance, the AUC on the training set was 0.97 with a 95% CI of 0.95\u20130.98, and on the validation set, it was 0.91 with a 95% CI of 0.84\u20130.98. These intervals indicate the range within which the true AUC is likely to fall, providing a sense of the precision of our estimates.\n\nStatistical significance was assessed using various tests. The combined model's performance was compared against models using only radiomics features and those using only clinical and imaging parameters. The differences in performance were found to be statistically significant. For example, the combined model outperformed the clinical model with volume of edema and male sex in both the training set (AUC: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.68\u20130.76, P = 0.01) and the validation set (AUC: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.75\u20130.88, P = 0.02). These P-values indicate that the observed differences are unlikely to be due to chance, reinforcing the claim that our combined model is superior.\n\nAdditionally, the optimal cutoff for stratifying high- and low-risk groups was determined to be \u22121.04, and this cutoff was validated on both the training and validation sets. The performance metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV), were also reported with their respective confidence intervals, further supporting the robustness of our findings.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics are accompanied by confidence intervals, and the results are statistically significant, providing strong evidence that our combined model is effective and superior to other models and baselines.",
