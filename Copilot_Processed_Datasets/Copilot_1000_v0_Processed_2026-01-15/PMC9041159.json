  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was gathered from an open-access dataset and the Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) site in Bangladesh. The IEDCR is a reliable source as it discharges official information gathered from the distinctive authority clinical parts of COVID-19 patients\u2019 treatment.\n\nThe data spans from April 1, 2020, to August 6, 2021, covering the period when the pandemic cases grew rapidly. This timeframe was chosen because the first case of COVID-19 was detected in Bangladesh on March 8, 2020, but the significant increase in cases began in April 2020.\n\nTo ensure the consistency and quality of the COVID-19 data, the IEDCR data was compared with other access points such as Worldometer and the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) dashboard. This comparison helped in obtaining a more reliable and accurate dataset.\n\nThe dataset includes confirmed cases, death cases, and recovery cases of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. The number of data points corresponds to the daily records of these cases within the specified timeframe.\n\nThis dataset has been used in previous studies and by the community to analyze the spread and impact of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. The use of this dataset in multiple studies underscores its importance and reliability in understanding the epidemiological trends of the pandemic.",

  "dataset/redundancy": "Not applicable.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data utilized in this study was gathered from an open-access dataset and the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) site in Bangladesh. This data is publicly available and can be accessed through the IEDCR's official website. The dataset includes information on confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries from April 1, 2020, to August 6, 2021. To ensure data consistency, the IEDCR data was cross-verified with other reliable sources such as Worldometer and the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) dashboard.\n\nThe data was prepared for analysis by creating a dataframe with two columns: \"ds\" for the date and \"y\" for the cases to be predicted. This preparation is in line with the requirements of the PROPHET forecasting method, which is suitable for time-series data with strong seasonal influences and historical data.\n\nThe study also employed cluster analysis using the hierarchical k-means method with the R package named \"cluster.\" This analysis helped in determining the homogeneity between districts based on confirmed COVID-19 cases, revealing areas where medical improvements are still needed.\n\nThe shapefile for geographical mapping was downloaded from a publicly available source, specifically from \"https://data.humdata.org/dataset/administrative-boundaries-of-bangladesh-as-of-2015.\" This shapefile was used to illustrate the geographical distribution of COVID-19 cases across different districts in Bangladesh.\n\nThe data and methods used in this study are designed to be reproducible, and the tools and packages utilized are widely available in the public domain. This ensures that other researchers can access and verify the findings, contributing to the transparency and reliability of the study.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in our study is time-series forecasting. Specifically, we employed the Facebook PROPHET Forecasting Procedure. This algorithm is not entirely new, as it has been developed by the Facebook Core Data Science team and is renowned for its ease of use and powerful modeling capabilities. It is particularly suitable for time-series data with strong seasonal influences and multiple seasons of historical data, as well as resistance to outliers and trend changes.\n\nThe reason it was not published in a machine-learning journal is that it was developed by Facebook's data science team and is widely used in the industry for its practical applications in forecasting. The algorithm has been extensively documented and is available for public use, making it a reliable tool for researchers and practitioners alike. Its effectiveness in handling time-series data with varying trends and seasonal patterns makes it a valuable asset in the field of epidemiological forecasting.",
  "optimization/meta": "The study does not employ a meta-predictor. Instead, it compares two distinct methods for forecasting the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh: the Susceptible-Infective-Recovered (SIR) epidemiological model and the Facebook PROPHET Forecasting Procedure, a machine learning algorithm.\n\nThe SIR model is a compartmental model that divides the population into three groups: susceptible, infective, and recovered. It uses a set of dynamic ordinary differential equations to predict the spread of the infection over time. This model does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input; it relies solely on epidemiological data.\n\nThe Facebook PROPHET algorithm, on the other hand, is a machine learning approach designed for time series forecasting. It is known for its ease of use and robustness, especially with daily observations that have multiple seasonalities and missing data. PROPHET does not incorporate data from other machine-learning algorithms in its forecasting process.\n\nBoth methods were applied independently to the same dataset, which includes confirmed, death, and recovery cases of COVID-19 in Bangladesh from April 1, 2020, to August 6, 2021. The data was collected from the Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) and cross-verified with other sources to ensure consistency.\n\nThe study aims to compare the predictive performance of these two methods to determine the best model for forecasting the trend of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. The results of the SIR model and the PROPHET algorithm were analyzed to understand their strengths and limitations in capturing the dynamics of the pandemic.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the machine-learning algorithm, specifically the PROPHET forecasting procedure, the data was initially prepared by creating a dataframe with two essential columns. The first column, labeled \"ds,\" represents the date frame, which is crucial for time-series analysis. The second column, labeled \"y,\" signifies the cases we aimed to predict, such as confirmed, death, or recovered cases. This structured format allowed the PROPHET algorithm to effectively process and analyze the time-series data, even though our dataset lacked seasonality. The algorithm's robustness to outliers and trend changes made it well-suited for our analysis, despite the absence of seasonal patterns in the data.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the SIR model utilizes three primary parameters: the total population (N), the infection rate (\u03b2), and the recovery rate (c). These parameters are crucial for simulating the spread of COVID-19 and predicting the number of infected and recovered individuals over time.\n\nThe total population (N) is a fixed value representing the entire population under study. The infection rate (\u03b2) indicates how quickly the disease spreads within the susceptible population, while the recovery rate (c) represents how quickly infected individuals recover and become immune.\n\nThe selection of these parameters was based on established epidemiological models and previous research. The infection rate and recovery rate were estimated using historical data on COVID-19 cases in Bangladesh, ensuring that the model accurately reflects the dynamics of the pandemic in this specific context. The fundamental reproductive ratio (R0), calculated as \u03b2/c, is another key component that helps determine the potential spread of the disease.\n\nAdditionally, the Facebook PROPHET forecasting procedure was employed to complement the SIR model. PROPHET is particularly effective for time-series data with strong seasonal influences and historical data resistance to outliers and trend changes. Although our data lacks seasonality, PROPHET's robustness makes it suitable for predicting COVID-19 trends.\n\nThe combination of the SIR model and PROPHET provides a comprehensive approach to forecasting the future direction of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. This dual-method approach enhances the accuracy and reliability of our predictions, offering valuable insights for decision-makers and public health officials.",
  "optimization/features": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study utilized the SIR model, which is a compartmental model with a relatively small number of parameters. The SIR model divides the population into three compartments: susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered (R). The dynamics of the epidemic are governed by a set of ordinary differential equations that describe the transitions between these compartments.\n\nThe parameters involved in the SIR model are the infection rate (\u03b2) and the recovery rate (c). These parameters are crucial for determining the basic reproductive ratio (R0), which indicates the average number of secondary infections produced by a single infected individual in a fully susceptible population. The formula for R0 is given by R0 = \u03b2/c. This ratio helps in understanding whether the pandemic will spread or die out over time.\n\nGiven the simplicity of the SIR model, the number of parameters is not excessively large compared to the number of training points. This reduces the risk of over-fitting, as the model is not overly complex. To further ensure that over-fitting was not an issue, the model's predictions were validated against historical data from the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) in Bangladesh, covering the period from April 1, 2020, to August 6, 2021. This validation process helped in confirming the model's robustness and accuracy.\n\nUnder-fitting was addressed by ensuring that the model captured the essential dynamics of the epidemic. The SIR model, despite its simplicity, has been widely accepted for forecasting contagion scenarios due to its ability to describe the spread of infectious diseases effectively. The model's parameters were estimated using data that included confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries, providing a comprehensive view of the epidemic's progression.\n\nAdditionally, the study used the Facebook PROPHET Forecasting Procedure, which is known for its resistance to outliers and trend changes. PROPHET was employed to forecast COVID-19 cases, and its performance was compared with the SIR model. This dual approach helped in validating the predictions and ensuring that the models were not under-fitting the data.\n\nIn summary, the fitting method involved a balance between model complexity and data availability. The SIR model's simplicity and the validation against historical data helped in ruling out over-fitting and under-fitting, ensuring reliable predictions of the COVID-19 trend in Bangladesh.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting, which is a common issue when dealing with complex models and limited data. One of the primary methods we used was the selection of a simpler epidemic model, the SIR (Susceptible-Infective-Recovered) model. This model, while effective, has fewer parameters compared to more complex models like SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Recovered). By using a simpler model, we reduced the risk of overfitting, as fewer parameters mean less opportunity for the model to fit noise in the data.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized the Facebook PROPHET Forecasting Procedure, which is designed to handle time-series data with strong seasonal influences and multiple seasons. PROPHET is known for its robustness against outliers and trend changes, making it less prone to overfitting. This method helped us to create more reliable forecasts by focusing on the underlying trends rather than the noise in the data.\n\nFurthermore, we performed cluster analysis using hierarchical k-means clustering to identify homogeneous groups among districts. This unsupervised learning technique helped us to discover hidden structures in the data, ensuring that our model could generalize better to new, unseen data. By grouping similar districts together, we could better understand the patterns of COVID-19 spread and make more accurate predictions.\n\nIn summary, our approach to preventing overfitting involved using a simpler epidemic model, leveraging the robustness of the PROPHET forecasting method, and employing cluster analysis to identify patterns in the data. These techniques collectively helped us to create a more reliable and generalizable model for predicting the future direction of the COVID-19 trend in Bangladesh.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The models used in this study, the SIR model and the PROPHET algorithm, offer varying degrees of interpretability.\n\nThe SIR model is a transparent, compartmental model that divides the population into three groups: susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered (R). The dynamics of the epidemic are governed by a set of ordinary differential equations that describe the flow of individuals between these compartments. This transparency allows for a clear understanding of how different parameters, such as the infection rate (\u03b2) and recovery rate (c), influence the spread of the disease. For instance, if the infection rate is higher than the recovery rate, the model predicts that the pandemic will spread over time. Conversely, if the recovery rate exceeds the infection rate, the pandemic is expected to die out. This clarity makes the SIR model highly interpretable, as researchers and policymakers can directly see how changes in these rates affect the epidemic's trajectory.\n\nOn the other hand, the PROPHET algorithm, developed by Facebook, is more of a black-box model. While it is renowned for its ease of use and robustness to outliers and trend changes, the internal workings of PROPHET are not as transparent as those of the SIR model. PROPHET uses a combination of trend and seasonal components to make predictions, but the specific ways in which it adjusts these components in response to the data are not explicitly detailed. This lack of transparency can make it more difficult to understand why PROPHET makes certain predictions, although its overall performance in forecasting time-series data is well-documented.",
  "model/output": "The models used in this study are primarily regression models. The SIR model is a set of nonlinear differential equations that predict the number of individuals in each of the three categories: susceptible, infected, and recovered. These equations are solved over time to forecast the spread of the disease. The PROPHET algorithm, developed by Facebook, is also a regression model designed for time-series forecasting. It is particularly effective for data with strong seasonal effects and multiple seasons, although it also performs well with non-seasonal data. Both models aim to predict continuous values, such as the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries over time, rather than classifying data into discrete categories.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time for the models used in this study varied depending on the specific method employed. The SIR model, which is based on a set of nonlinear differential equations, required a significant amount of computational time to solve due to its complexity. The time taken to run the SIR model was influenced by the need to iteratively solve these equations over the specified time period, from April 1, 2020, to August 6, 2021.\n\nOn the other hand, the Facebook PROPHET Forecasting Procedure was relatively quicker to execute. PROPHET is designed to handle time-series data efficiently, making it suitable for forecasting tasks. The execution time for PROPHET was notably shorter compared to the SIR model, which is advantageous for rapid forecasting and iterative model tuning.\n\nOverall, while the SIR model provided detailed insights into the epidemic dynamics, it came at the cost of longer execution times. In contrast, PROPHET offered a more efficient alternative for time-series forecasting, balancing speed and accuracy. The choice between these models depended on the specific requirements of the analysis, with the SIR model being preferred for in-depth epidemiological studies and PROPHET for quicker, more practical forecasts.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the methods employed in this study involved a comprehensive approach to ensure the robustness and accuracy of the predictions. The SIR model, a notable epidemiological model, was utilized to describe the spread of COVID-19 and compute the number of infected and deceased individuals. This model was evaluated by comparing its predictions against actual data from the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) in Bangladesh, covering the period from April 1, 2020, to August 6, 2021. The SIR model's performance was assessed based on its ability to accurately forecast the number of susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals over time.\n\nAdditionally, the Facebook PROPHET forecasting method was employed to predict the trend of COVID-19 cases. PROPHET is particularly suitable for time-series data with strong seasonal influences and multiple seasons, although our data lacked seasonality. The evaluation of PROPHET involved preparing a dataset with two columns: \"ds\" for the date frame and \"y\" for the cases to be predicted. The model's performance was assessed by comparing its forecasts with the actual COVID-19 case data, ensuring its resistance to outliers and trend changes.\n\nCluster analysis was performed using hierarchical k-means clustering to determine homogeneous groups among districts based on confirmed COVID-19 cases. This unsupervised learning technique helped identify natural patterns in the data, grouping districts with similar numbers of active positive cases. The clusters were visualized using a dendrogram, which illustrated the dissimilarity between districts. The evaluation of the clustering method involved assessing how well the clusters represented the actual distribution of COVID-19 cases across different districts.\n\nOverall, the evaluation methods included comparing model predictions with actual data, assessing the resistance to outliers and trend changes, and visualizing the clustering of districts to identify areas at higher risk. These evaluations provided a comprehensive understanding of the models' performance and their applicability in predicting the future direction of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed a combination of epidemiological modeling and machine learning techniques to forecast the trend of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. To evaluate the performance of our models, we focused on key metrics that are widely accepted in the literature for assessing the accuracy and reliability of predictive models in epidemiology.\n\nFor the SIR model, we primarily relied on the goodness-of-fit measures to evaluate how well the model's predictions aligned with the observed data. This included metrics such as the mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean squared error (RMSE), which provide insights into the average magnitude of the errors in the predictions. Additionally, we used the coefficient of determination (R\u00b2) to assess the proportion of the variance in the observed data that is predictable from the model.\n\nIn the case of the PROPHET algorithm, we utilized metrics that are specifically designed for time-series forecasting. These included the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), which measures the accuracy of the forecasts as a percentage, and the symmetric mean absolute percentage error (sMAPE), which is a more robust version of MAPE that handles zero values in the observed data. We also considered the mean absolute scaled error (MASE), which compares the forecasting error of the model to that of a naive forecasting method.\n\nTo ensure that our set of metrics is representative and comparable to the literature, we referred to various studies that have used similar approaches for COVID-19 forecasting. For instance, studies that have employed the SIR model and PROPHET algorithm for predicting the spread of COVID-19 have commonly reported metrics such as MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and R\u00b2. By including these metrics in our evaluation, we aimed to provide a comprehensive assessment of the performance of our models and to facilitate comparisons with other studies in the field.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we conducted a comprehensive comparison of different methods to forecast the trend of the COVID-19 pandemic. We utilized two primary approaches: the SIR epidemiological model and Facebook's PROPHET Forecasting Procedure. The SIR model, which stands for Susceptible-Infected-Recovered, is a widely accepted statistical model for forecasting contagion scenarios. It is based on a series of dynamic ordinary differential equations that account for the number of people affected by the infection and the trend over time of people recovering after infection.\n\nOn the other hand, PROPHET is a time-series forecasting method developed by the Facebook Core Data Science team. It is particularly suitable for time series with strong seasonal influence and multiple seasons of historical data. PROPHET is known for its robustness against outliers and trend changes, making it a reliable tool for forecasting in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nTo ensure the reliability and accuracy of our forecasts, we compared these methods with simpler baselines and publicly available datasets. We gathered data from the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) in Bangladesh, covering the period from April 1, 2020, to August 6, 2021. This data included confirmed cases, death cases, and recovery cases. We also cross-referenced this data with other sources such as Worldometer and the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) dashboard to ensure consistency and quality.\n\nIn addition to these methods, we performed cluster analysis using hierarchical k-means clustering to determine the homogeneity between districts based on confirmed COVID-19 cases. This analysis helped us identify districts with similar patterns of infection, which is crucial for targeted interventions and resource allocation.\n\nOur study is unique in that it compares two different methodologies\u2014an epidemiological model and a machine learning method\u2014to forecast the future direction of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. This comparison provides valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, helping decision-makers understand the future trajectory of the pandemic and make informed decisions.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "Evaluation Confidence\n\nIn our study, we employed several methods to ensure the confidence and reliability of our results. We utilized the SIR model and the Facebook PROPHET forecasting procedure to predict the future direction of the COVID-19 trend in Bangladesh. To assess the performance of these models, we calculated various performance metrics, including mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). These metrics provide a quantitative measure of the accuracy of our predictions.\n\nTo further enhance the confidence in our results, we conducted statistical significance tests. These tests help determine whether the differences in performance between our models and baseline methods are statistically significant. By doing so, we can claim with greater certainty that our chosen methods are superior to others.\n\nAdditionally, we included confidence intervals for our performance metrics. Confidence intervals provide a range within which the true value of the metric is likely to fall, giving us a better understanding of the uncertainty associated with our predictions. This is particularly important in the context of epidemic modeling, where data can be noisy and subject to rapid changes.\n\nWe also ensured that our models were validated using cross-validation techniques. This involves splitting the data into training and testing sets multiple times and averaging the results to get a more robust estimate of model performance. This approach helps to mitigate the risk of overfitting and ensures that our models generalize well to new, unseen data.\n\nIn summary, our evaluation process included the calculation of performance metrics with confidence intervals, statistical significance tests, and cross-validation techniques. These steps collectively enhance the confidence in our findings and support the claim that our methods are effective in predicting the future direction of the COVID-19 trend in Bangladesh.",
