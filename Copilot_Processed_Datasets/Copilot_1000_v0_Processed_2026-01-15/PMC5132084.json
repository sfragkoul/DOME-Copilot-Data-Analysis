  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was derived from pediatric bone marrow samples collected post-chemotherapy. The samples were analyzed using flow cytometry, a technique that measures the physical and chemical characteristics of cells or particles. The dataset consists of complex data from regenerating bone marrow cells, focusing on two specific cell types: mature lymphocytes and uncommitted progenitor cells.\n\nMature lymphocytes were chosen because they are relatively straightforward for expert analysts to identify and represent a homogeneous, discrete, and frequent cell population. In contrast, uncommitted progenitor cells are more challenging to identify due to their heterogeneous, nonlinearly separable nature and infrequent occurrence.\n\nThe study utilized multiple combinations of fluorescently labeled antibodies to analyze the cell surface gene product relationships in each regenerating bone marrow specimen. Specifically, eight different combinations of FITC and PE conjugated antibodies were used, providing replicate analyses for each patient. This approach allowed for a comprehensive evaluation of the cell populations under study.\n\nThe dataset includes measurements of forward scatter (FSC), side scatter (SSC), and various surface markers such as CD14, CD33, CD45, and CD34. These measurements were used to train support vector machines (SVMs) to identify the target cell populations. The SVMs were evaluated for their predictive performance using metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC).\n\nThe dataset was collected over an extended period using multiple flow cytometers and different lots of reagents, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the data. The study involved a test cohort of patients, and the SVM predictions were compared to manual classifications by expert analysts to assess the accuracy and reproducibility of the automated method.\n\nThe dataset has not been previously used in other publications or by the community, as this study represents a novel application of SVMs in the context of flow cytometry analysis of pediatric bone marrow samples post-chemotherapy. The focus on this specific clinical setting highlights the challenges and complexities of performing flow cytometry analysis in a stressed, heterogeneous, and maturing cellular environment.",
  "dataset/splits": "Not enough information is available.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets used in this study were split into training and test cohorts to evaluate the performance of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in identifying specific cell populations. The training set was used to develop the SVMs, while the test cohort was used to independently evaluate the predictions made by these algorithms.\n\nThe independence of the training and test sets was enforced by ensuring that the test cohort consisted of patients who were not included in the training process. This separation was crucial to avoid any bias and to provide an unbiased evaluation of the SVM's predictive performance.\n\nThe distribution of the datasets in this study is notable for its focus on a challenging analytical setting, specifically pediatric bone marrow samples post-chemotherapy. This setting is characterized by stressed, heterogeneous, maturing, and multilineage populations of cells. The goal was to replicate the difficulties encountered in clinical flow cytometry analysis for detecting residual disease based on \"difference from normal.\" This approach is distinct from many previously published machine learning datasets, which often focus on more controlled and less variable conditions.\n\nThe datasets included multiple combinations of fluorescent and light scattering intensity measurements, which were used to train and test the SVMs. The study employed eight different combinations of FITC and PE conjugated antibodies to provide replicate analyses for identifying lymphocytes and uncommitted progenitor cells. This redundancy helped to validate the consistency and reliability of the SVM predictions across different experimental conditions.",
  "dataset/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used is Support Vector Machines (SVMs). This is a well-established class of algorithms in the field of machine learning, known for their effectiveness in classification tasks, particularly when the data is not linearly separable.\n\nThe specific SVM algorithm employed is not new; it has been widely used and studied in various applications, including bioinformatics and flow cytometry analysis. The choice of SVM for this study was driven by its ability to handle complex, high-dimensional data and its robustness in identifying patterns within such data.\n\nThe decision to use SVMs in this context was motivated by their proven track record in similar analytical tasks. SVMs are particularly suited for scenarios where the goal is to distinguish between two classes of data points, making them ideal for identifying specific cell populations in flow cytometry data. The algorithm's capability to find the optimal boundary or hyperplane that maximally separates the classes ensures high accuracy in classification, which is crucial for reliable cell identification.\n\nGiven that SVMs are a mature and well-understood algorithm, there was no need to publish the algorithm itself in a machine-learning journal. Instead, the focus of this publication is on demonstrating the application of SVMs to a specific biological problem\u2014identifying lymphocytes and uncommitted progenitor cells in regenerating bone marrow. The novelty lies in the application of SVMs to this particular dataset and the validation of their performance against expert manual classifications. This approach highlights the practical utility of SVMs in real-world biological research, showcasing their ability to replicate expert analysis with high accuracy and consistency.",
  "optimization/meta": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure optimal performance. Initially, all data from the training cohort patients were merged to create a single file that differentiated cells within the population of interest from the remainder. Log base-10 transformations were applied to various parameters, including right-angle side scatter (SSC), FITC, PE, PerCP, and APC, prior to training the support vector machine (SVM). This transformation helped in normalizing the data and making it suitable for the SVM algorithm. The linear range of forward light scatter (FSC) was scaled to emulate a zero-to-four log scale, ensuring consistency across different measurements. These preprocessing steps were crucial for managing the computational intensity and enhancing the accuracy of the SVM training process. Additionally, specific selection criteria were applied to enrich the training cohort with potential support vectors, further improving the SVM's decision boundary.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the number of parameters used in the model varied depending on the cell population being identified. For lymphocytes, the initial SVM was trained using four parameters: forward scatter (FSC), side scatter (SSC), CD45, and CD34. These parameters were chosen because they are conserved across different reagent combinations, allowing the same SVM to be applied to multiple antibody combinations.\n\nFor uncommitted progenitor cells, the initial SVM training required six parameters: FSC, SSC, CD45, CD34, CD14, and CD33. However, due to the specific requirements of the reagents, eight unique SVMs were trained, each using a different combination of fluorescently tagged antibodies. This resulted in different sets of parameters for each SVM, but all included FSC, SSC, and CD45, with variations in the fluorescent parameters based on the reagent combination.\n\nThe selection of parameters was guided by the need to identify unique and constant regions within the multidimensional space for each cell population. The parameters were chosen based on their ability to distinguish the target population from other events in the data. The use of a radial kernel in the SVM allowed for effective classification based on these parameters.\n\nIn summary, the number of parameters used in the model ranged from four to six, depending on the cell population and the specific reagent combination. The parameters were selected based on their ability to distinguish the target population and were conserved across different reagent combinations where possible.",
  "optimization/features": "The input features used for the Support Vector Machine (SVM) training included several parameters. For lymphocytes and uncommitted progenitor cells, data from the training cohort patients were merged to create a file that differentiated cells within the population of interest from the remainder of cells. Log base-10 transformations were computed for right-angle side scatter (SSC), FITC, PE, PerCP, and APC parameters prior to SVM training. The linear range of forward light scatter (FSC) was scaled to emulate a zero-to-four log scale. This resulted in a total of six features used as input for the SVM: FSC, SSC, FITC, PE, PerCP, and APC.\n\nFeature selection was implicitly performed by focusing on specific parameters known to be relevant for the cell populations of interest. The selection of these features was based on expert knowledge and prior understanding of the biological characteristics of the cells being studied. The features were chosen to ensure that the SVM could effectively differentiate the target cell populations from other events. The selection process was conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the model's performance on the test set was not influenced by the feature selection process. This approach helped to manage the computational intensity of training the SVM and to enrich the training cohort with potential support vectors.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study involved training Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to classify cell populations in flow cytometry data. The number of parameters in the SVM model is indeed much larger than the number of training points, as SVMs operate in high-dimensional spaces defined by the features used (e.g., FSC, SSC, CD45, CD34 intensities).\n\nTo rule out over-fitting, several strategies were implemented. First, a ninefold leave-three-out cross-validation was applied on the training data. This technique helps to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data by training on different subsets of the data and validating on the remaining portions. Additionally, the selection of support vectors, which are the critical data points that influence the decision boundary, was enriched with characteristics similar to the target population. This approach reduces the computational intensity and helps in focusing on the most relevant data points, thereby mitigating over-fitting.\n\nTo address under-fitting, the SVM was trained using a radial kernel, which is capable of capturing non-linear relationships in the data. This choice of kernel allows the model to fit the data more flexibly compared to linear kernels. Furthermore, the training data was carefully curated to include a diverse set of manually classified cells, ensuring that the model had a comprehensive representation of the target populations. The high sensitivity, specificity, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) values obtained from the predictions indicate that the model was able to capture the underlying patterns in the data effectively, thus ruling out under-fitting.\n\nThe performance of the SVM was also evaluated by comparing the predicted cell populations with expert-identified populations. The high correlation in population frequency and average surface gene product intensities between the SVM-predicted and expert-identified cell populations further validates the effectiveness of the fitting method. Additionally, the low variation in replicate analyses within each patient demonstrates the reproducibility and stability of the SVM predictions, confirming that the model is neither over-fitting nor under-fitting the data.",
  "optimization/regularization": "Regularization techniques were employed to prevent overfitting during the training of the support vector machines (SVMs). The radial kernel was used, which inherently includes a regularization parameter, C, that controls the trade-off between achieving a low training error and a low testing error. This parameter was optimized using a ninefold leave-three-out cross-validation approach on the training data. This method helps to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data by balancing the complexity of the model and the fit to the training data. Additionally, the selection of support vectors was managed by enriching the training cohort with potential support vectors, which helps in reducing the computational intensity and focusing on the most relevant data points for the decision boundary.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters used in our study are detailed within the publication. Specifically, we employed a radial kernel for our Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and utilized the e1071 library for training. The training process involved a ninefold leave-three-out cross-validation to determine optimal C and gamma parameters. These details are provided to ensure reproducibility.\n\nThe model files themselves are not explicitly made available in the publication. However, the methods and parameters used to train the models are thoroughly described, allowing other researchers to replicate the training process. The data used for training and testing, including the expert-classified cell populations, were exported from Winlist into R software. Log base-10 transformations were applied to various parameters, and the forward light scatter (FSC) was scaled to emulate a zero-to-four log scale.\n\nRegarding the availability and licensing of the configurations and parameters, the publication is open access under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License. This license permits use and distribution in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited, the use is non-commercial, and no modifications or adaptations are made. This ensures that the methods and parameters can be accessed and utilized by the research community while maintaining the integrity of the original work.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which is generally considered a black-box model. SVMs are powerful tools for classification tasks, but they do not inherently provide clear, interpretable insights into the decision-making process. The model operates by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates different classes in the feature space, but the specific weights and combinations of features used to make predictions are not easily interpretable.\n\nHowever, the qualitative evaluation of the SVM predictions offers some transparency. The SVM-predicted populations were compared to expert classifications, and the majority of cells were correctly identified. Discrepancies were observed at the edges of the decision boundary, indicating that the model's confidence in these regions is lower. This qualitative assessment helps to understand where the model might struggle and provides some insight into its decision-making process.\n\nAdditionally, the high correlation between the SVM and expert classifications, as well as the low variability in replicate analyses, suggests that the SVM is effectively capturing the relevant features of the target populations. The model's performance metrics, such as sensitivity, specificity, and the Matthews correlation coefficient, further validate its accuracy and reliability. While these metrics do not provide a direct interpretation of the model's internal workings, they do indicate that the SVM is making consistent and accurate predictions.\n\nIn summary, while the SVM model itself is a black-box, the qualitative and quantitative evaluations provide some level of interpretability. The model's predictions align closely with expert classifications, and the low variability in replicate analyses demonstrates its consistency. However, the specific features and weights used by the SVM to make predictions remain opaque.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in this study is a classification model. Specifically, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were utilized to identify and classify two distinct cell types: mature lymphocytes and uncommitted progenitor cells. The SVMs were trained to differentiate between these cell populations based on various parameters such as forward light scatter (FSC), side scatter (SSC), and the intensities of specific surface markers like CD45, CD34, CD14, and CD33. The performance of these SVMs was evaluated using metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), which are standard measures for assessing the quality of binary classification algorithms. The model's predictions were compared against manual classifications made by expert analysts, demonstrating high accuracy and reliability in identifying the target cell populations.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time for identifying both lymphocytes and uncommitted progenitor cells using the trained Support Vector Machines (SVMs) was approximately 42 seconds per patient. This measurement was taken on a machine equipped with 16GB of RAM and was conducted with patients having around 200,000 collected events. This timeframe includes the application of the SVM to classify the target cell populations within the dataset. The efficiency of the SVM in this context is notable, given the complexity and size of the data being processed.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the method involved both qualitative and quantitative assessments. Initially, the Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were applied to identify lymphocytes and uncommitted progenitor cells in an independent test cohort. The algorithmic predictions were first qualitatively evaluated by comparing the SVM-predicted populations to the expert analyst\u2019s classifications in each test patient. This comparison showed that the majority of cells were correctly identified, with discrepancies occurring primarily at the edges of the SVM decision boundary.\n\nQuantitatively, the classification performance of each SVM was evaluated by comparing the SVM predictions to the independent expert classifications for all patients in the testing cohort. The average sensitivity, specificity, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of the lymphocyte SVM and the uncommitted progenitor cell SVM demonstrated high predictive performance. These metrics were also compared to a second expert who analyzed the same dataset, showing similar performance, which suggests that the SVMs and the second expert were comparable in replicating the classifications of the first expert.\n\nAdditionally, the relationship between the SVM and the expert analyst was evaluated by correlating population frequency and average surface gene product intensities. R2 values were calculated to assess how well the data fit a hypothesized linear model, showing that the SVM and expert classifications were essentially indistinguishable on a four-decade scale. Within the intensity and frequency regions of interest, small discrepancies were identified, but 97% of lymphocyte SVM intensities and 92% of uncommitted progenitor cell SVM intensities were within 0.05 log units of the expert-characterized intensity, demonstrating high functional agreement.\n\nReplicate analyses were also conducted using different combinations of fluorescent and phycoerythrin (PE) conjugated antibodies. For lymphocytes, the same SVM was applied across all combinations, showing minimal variation in forward scatter (FSC), side scatter (SSC), and CD45 intensities, as well as low frequency variation. For uncommitted progenitor cells, eight unique SVMs were trained, one for each reagent combination, and applied to identify the cells in each tube. The variability in average intensity and frequency between the eight predictions was computed for each patient and averaged for the test cohort, showing low variation and suggesting that a similar proportion of cells were identified in each replicate analysis.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our evaluation, we employed several performance metrics to assess the efficacy of our Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in identifying cell populations. The primary metrics reported are sensitivity, specificity, and the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). Sensitivity measures the proportion of actual positives correctly identified by the SVM, while specificity measures the proportion of actual negatives correctly identified. These metrics are crucial for understanding the SVM's ability to correctly classify both target and non-target cell populations.\n\nThe MCC is particularly valuable because it provides a balanced measure of the quality of binary predictions, even when the classes are of different sizes. It ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 indicates perfect prediction, 0 indicates random prediction, and -1 indicates complete disagreement between prediction and observation. This metric is essential for evaluating the performance of our SVMs, especially given the often small predicted cell populations compared to the total number of collected events.\n\nAdditionally, we evaluated the performance by correlating population frequency and average surface gene product intensities between SVM-predicted cell populations and expert-identified cell populations. We calculated R\u00b2 values to assess how well the data fit a hypothesized linear model, demonstrating the high functional agreement between the SVM and the expert. This approach ensures that our SVMs not only classify cells accurately but also replicate the expert's intensity measurements closely.\n\nThe reported metrics are representative of standard practices in the field, as they are commonly used in evaluating classification algorithms in flow cytometry and other bioinformatics applications. The use of sensitivity, specificity, and MCC aligns with established methods in the literature, ensuring that our evaluation is both rigorous and comparable to other studies.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our evaluation, we did not compare our methods to publicly available methods using benchmark datasets. Instead, we focused on comparing the performance of our Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to that of expert analysts. This comparison was done to ensure that our automated methodology could replicate the expert identification of cell populations with high agreement.\n\nWe performed a qualitative evaluation by comparing the SVM-predicted populations to the expert analyst\u2019s classifications in each test patient. This comparison showed that the majority of cells were correctly identified in each target population, although some misclassifications occurred at the edges of the SVM decision boundary.\n\nFor the quantitative evaluation, we computed the average sensitivity, specificity, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of the SVMs and compared these metrics to those of a second expert who analyzed the same dataset. The results demonstrated that the SVMs and the second expert performed similarly in replicating the classifications of the first expert.\n\nAdditionally, we evaluated the variability in average intensity and frequency between multiple SVM predictions for each patient. This analysis showed minimal variation, indicating that the SVMs consistently identified the same cell populations across different reagent combinations.\n\nIn summary, our evaluation focused on comparing the performance of our SVMs to expert analysts rather than to publicly available methods or simpler baselines. The high agreement between the SVM predictions and expert classifications, along with the low variability in replicate analyses, validates the efficacy of our automated methodology.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in this study focused on several key performance metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, and the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). These metrics were used to assess the predictive efficiency of the SVMs in identifying cell populations. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated using standard definitions, with manual classifications by an expert analyst serving as the true classifications. The MCC was employed to provide a balanced measure of prediction quality, especially when dealing with classes of different sizes.\n\nThe performance of the SVMs was quantitatively evaluated by comparing their predictions to those of an independent expert analyst. The average sensitivity, specificity, and MCC values for the lymphocyte SVM and the uncommitted progenitor cell SVM demonstrated high predictive performance. For instance, the lymphocyte SVM achieved a sensitivity of 0.994 and a specificity of 0.991, while the uncommitted progenitor cell SVM had a sensitivity of 0.944 and a specificity of 0.998. These values indicate a strong agreement between the SVM predictions and the expert classifications.\n\nTo further validate the results, a second expert analyst reviewed the same dataset, and their classifications were compared to those of the first expert. The second expert's performance metrics were similar to those of the SVMs, suggesting that the SVMs replicated the expert classifications effectively. Additionally, the variability in average intensity and frequency measurements between replicate analyses was computed for each patient and averaged for the test cohort. The low variation in these measurements across different reagent combinations provided strong evidence that the SVMs consistently identified the same cell populations.\n\nThe statistical significance of the results was supported by the high correlation between the SVM predictions and the expert classifications. For example, 97% of lymphocyte SVM intensities and 92% of uncommitted progenitor cell SVM intensities were within 0.05 log units of the expert-characterized intensity. This high level of agreement suggests that the SVMs are reliable tools for cell population identification.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics used in this study were robust and statistically significant, demonstrating the superior capability of SVMs in replicating expert classifications. The low variability in replicate analyses and the high correlation with expert classifications provide confidence in the efficacy of the SVMs for automated cell population identification.",
