  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from the UK-wide Premium Cattle Health Scheme. The samples were collected between November 2021 and November 2022. The dataset consists of 66 MAP-positive cattle samples and 65 MAP-negative samples. These samples were selected based on specific criteria to ensure the accuracy of the MAP status. For MAP-positive samples, animals had to have an ID Screen Paratuberculosis Indirect ELISA test result greater than 70% and either a positive faecal PCR test within two months or be from herds with over 3% MAP-seropositive animals for at least the previous year. For MAP-negative samples, controls were chosen from herds with no seropositive results in annual tests of all animals over 24 months of age for a minimum of five consecutive years. This careful selection process aimed to minimize false negatives and ensure the reliability of the dataset. The dataset has not been used in previous papers or by the community.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was partitioned into 10 folds for the purpose of training and validating the random forest model. This process was repeated five times to ensure robustness and reduce dependence on the initial data partition. In each iteration, nine folds were used for training the model, while the remaining one fold served as the test set. This cross-validation approach helped to balance the variance-bias trade-off and manage overfitting, providing a fairer assessment of the model's predictive ability on new, unseen samples. The distribution of data points in each split was designed to be as balanced as possible, with each fold containing a representative sample of the overall dataset to ensure that the model's performance was consistent across different subsets of the data.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset was split using a five-time repeated 10-fold cross-validation (CV) pipeline. This involved randomly partitioning the input data into 10 folds, with nine folds used for training the model and one fold held out as the test set sequentially. This process was repeated five times to reduce dependence on the initial partition, helping to balance the variance-bias trade-off and manage overfitting. This approach ensures that the training and test sets are independent in each iteration, providing a fairer assessment of the model's predictive ability on new samples. The distribution of the dataset was managed to include a mix of infected and healthy samples, with efforts made to minimize false negatives by selecting control samples from low-risk farms. This methodology is consistent with robust practices in machine learning to ensure the reliability and generalizability of the results.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in our study is the random forest (RF) algorithm. This is a well-established and widely used ensemble learning method known for its robustness and high predictive accuracy. It operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.\n\nThe RF algorithm is not new; it has been extensively studied and applied in various fields, including medical diagnostics. The choice to use RF in our study was driven by its proven effectiveness in handling complex datasets and its ability to provide reliable predictions. The algorithm's strength lies in its capacity to manage high-dimensional data, reduce overfitting through bootstrapping, and provide insights into variable importance, which is crucial for identifying key miRNAs in our diagnostic model.\n\nGiven that the RF algorithm is a mature and well-documented method, it was not necessary to publish it in a machine-learning journal. Instead, our focus was on applying this established technique to a novel biological context\u2014specifically, the diagnosis of Johne\u2019s disease in cattle using miRNA expression profiles. The innovation lies in the application of RF to this particular problem, rather than in the development of a new algorithm. Our study contributes to the field by demonstrating the potential of miRNA profiling combined with advanced machine-learning techniques for improving diagnostic accuracy in veterinary medicine.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employed in this study is a random forest (RF) classifier, which is a type of ensemble learning method. It does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input in the traditional sense of a meta-predictor. Instead, the RF algorithm generates a diverse collection of decision trees. Each tree is trained on random subsets of the samples and miRNA signals. The predicted status for a sample is determined by majority vote across all trees.\n\nThe RF method involves a five-time repeated 10-fold cross-validation (CV) pipeline. This means the input data is randomly partitioned into 10 folds, with nine folds used to train the model and one fold held out as the test set sequentially. This process is repeated five times to reduce dependence on the initial partition, helping to balance the variance-bias trade-off and manage overfitting. This ensures that the training data is independent for each fold, contributing to a fairer assessment of the model's predictive ability on new samples.\n\nThe performance metrics, including overall accuracy, area under the receiver operating curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity, are assessed on each test set across the CV process and then averaged to provide an overall assessment of performance on independent blind samples. This approach ensures that the model's predictions are robust and generalizable to new, unseen data.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure the miRNA expression profiles were suitable for analysis. Initially, serum samples from cattle were processed using the Fireplex miRNA platform to generate miRNA profiles. The mean fluorescence intensities (MFIs) of miRNA-specific particles per sample were measured using a Novocyte flow cytometer. These raw data were then exported and processed using the Fireplex Analysis Workbench to obtain relative expression values. The geNorm function, with pre-selected normalizers, was employed to prepare these values.\n\nSubsequently, the miRNA profiles underwent normalization, centering, scaling, and Yeo-Johnson transformation. These preprocessing steps were crucial for standardizing the data and making it suitable for input into the machine-learning model. The random forest (RF) algorithm, known for its high predictive accuracy and applicability in medical diagnostics, was then used to analyze these preprocessed miRNA profiles. The RF method involved generating a diverse collection of decision trees trained on random subsets of samples and miRNA signals. The predicted status for each sample was determined by majority vote across all trees, ensuring robust and reliable classification.",
  "optimization/parameters": "The model utilized a random forest (RF) algorithm, which is known for its robustness and ability to handle high-dimensional data. The number of parameters, often referred to as the number of random predictors included at each split in a tree (mtry), was tuned using a random search method. This tuning process was conducted within a five-time repeated 10-fold cross-validation (CV) pipeline. The optimal value for mtry was determined to be 13. This value was selected based on the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC), which was used as the performance metric for tuning. The RF training involved growing 500 decision trees in each CV round, ensuring a comprehensive and stable model. The predictive status probabilities for the samples were obtained by averaging across the CV rounds, providing a reliable assessment of the model's performance.",
  "optimization/features": "The study utilized a panel of 24 miRNAs as input features for the machine learning model. These miRNAs were selected through a comprehensive review of the literature, focusing on those with altered expression in response to mycobacterial infection. The selection process involved excluding miRNAs that were not present in the bovine miRNA repertoire or had significant differences between the probe sequences used and the target bovine miRNA in the database.\n\nFeature selection was implicitly performed during the design of the miRNA panel, ensuring that only relevant miRNAs were included. The mean fluorescence intensities (MFIs) of these miRNAs were measured across all samples, and the data were pre-processed, including normalization using pre-selected normalizers. This preprocessing step helped in stabilizing the miRNA expression data, making them suitable for the subsequent machine learning analysis.\n\nThe random forest (RF) algorithm was employed for the classification task, and its training involved a five-time repeated 10-fold cross-validation pipeline. This approach helped in balancing the variance-bias trade-off and managing overfitting, ensuring a fair assessment of the model's predictive ability on new samples. The importance of each miRNA in discriminating the infectivity status was determined by averaging the change in predictive accuracy after adding or removing each miRNA. This process highlighted the most relevant miRNAs, such as bta-miR-100-5p, bta-miR-21-5p, bta-miR-29b-3p, and bta-miR-29a-3p, which played significant roles in the classification task.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study utilized a random forest (RF) algorithm, which is well-suited for handling datasets where the number of parameters (features) is much larger than the number of training points (samples). This is a common scenario in high-dimensional data, such as miRNA expression profiles.\n\nTo mitigate the risk of overfitting, a rigorous cross-validation strategy was implemented. Specifically, a five-time repeated 10-fold cross-validation (CV) pipeline was used. In this process, the data were randomly partitioned into 10 folds, with nine folds used for training and one fold held out for testing. This procedure was repeated five times to ensure that the model's performance was not dependent on a particular data split. This approach helps to balance the variance-bias trade-off and manage overfitting, where a method becomes overly specific to the training data. By averaging the performance metrics across all CV rounds, a more reliable assessment of the model's predictive ability on new, independent samples was obtained.\n\nTo address underfitting, the RF algorithm's hyperparameters were carefully tuned. The number of decision trees was set to 500 for each CV round, and the optimal number of random predictors included at each split (mtry tuning parameter) was determined through random search, with the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) serving as the tuning criterion. This ensured that the model was complex enough to capture the underlying patterns in the data without being too simplistic.\n\nAdditionally, the importance of each miRNA signal in the prediction was determined by averaging the change in predictive accuracy when each signal was added or removed. This variable importance score helped in identifying the most relevant miRNAs for discriminating between infected and healthy samples, further refining the model and preventing underfitting.\n\nIn summary, the combination of repeated cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and variable importance scoring ensured that the RF model was neither overfitted nor underfitted, providing a robust and reliable diagnostic tool for discriminating between MAP-positive and MAP-negative bovine sera.",

  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is a Random Forest (RF) classifier, which is inherently more interpretable than many other machine learning models, such as deep neural networks. Random Forests are considered transparent to a certain extent because they provide insights into the importance of individual features in making predictions. This transparency is achieved through the calculation of variable importance scores, which indicate the contribution of each miRNA to the model's predictive accuracy.\n\nIn our study, the RF model was used to identify the most relevant miRNAs for discriminating between infected and healthy cattle. The variable importance scores, scaled into a range of [0, 100], allowed us to rank the miRNAs based on their significance. For instance, bta-miR-100-5p was found to be the most important miRNA with a score of 100, followed by bta-miR-21-5p with a score of 78.32. This ranking provides clear examples of how specific miRNAs contribute to the model's predictions, making it easier to understand which biological markers are crucial for diagnosing Johne\u2019s disease.\n\nAdditionally, the RF model's decision trees can be individually examined to see how different combinations of miRNA expressions lead to specific predictions. While this level of detail can be complex, it offers a pathway for further biological interpretation and validation. The use of cross-validation and the averaging of predictive accuracy changes when adding or removing each miRNA signal further enhances the model's reliability and interpretability.\n\nOverall, the RF model strikes a balance between complexity and interpretability, providing valuable insights into the biological mechanisms underlying Johne\u2019s disease while maintaining robust predictive performance.",

The AUC provides an aggregate measure of performance across all classification thresholds, offering a single scalar value that summarizes the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity, also known as the true positive rate, measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified by the model. Specificity, or the true negative rate, measures the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified.\n\nThese metrics are well-established in the literature and are commonly used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models, particularly in medical diagnostics.
