  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study is synthetic and derived from the Japanese Nosocomial Infection Surveillance system. This system provides a robust foundation for understanding factors associated with nosocomial infections in intensive care units. The synthetic data were constructed based on hazard ratios (HR) of various factors, as revealed by previous studies, particularly those by Suka et al. and Barraclough et al. Each binary value in the dataset represents whether a patient possesses a specific attribute, with these values obtained from probability distributions according to their respective HRs.\n\nThe dataset includes a realistic distribution of values, ensuring that the training and validation datasets are representative of actual clinical scenarios. Each row in the spreadsheet corresponds to a different ICU patient, with columns representing quantifiable attributes that distinguish these patients. These attributes are used to describe the activity of input and output neuronal units in the neural network simulations.\n\nThe number of data points in the dataset is not explicitly stated, but it is implied that the dataset is sufficiently large to train and validate the neural network effectively. The use of synthetic data allows for controlled experiments and ensures that the model can be tested under various conditions before being applied to real-world data.\n\nPrevious work by Suka et al. and Barraclough et al. has laid the groundwork for understanding the factors associated with nosocomial infections. The synthetic dataset leverages this existing knowledge to create a realistic and comprehensive dataset for training the neural network. This approach ensures that the model is built on a solid foundation of established research, enhancing its reliability and potential for real-world application.",
  "dataset/splits": "Two data splits were created for this study: a training set and a validation set. The training set consists of 15 patients or patterns, while the validation set includes 6 patients or patterns. The training set size was chosen to be 15 times the number of classes to obtain, and the validation set size was set to six times the number of classes to obtain. These splits were designed to evaluate the performance of the artificial neural network on both seen and unseen data, ensuring a realistic distribution of values involved. The training set is used to teach the network, while the validation set is used to assess its generalization capability.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets used in this study were split into training and validation sets. These sets were designed to follow a realistic distribution of the values involved, ensuring that they represent the actual scenarios encountered in intensive care units. The training set was used to teach the neural network, while the validation set was used to assess its performance on unseen data.\n\nThe independence of the training and test sets was enforced by ensuring that the data in each set were distinct and did not overlap. This was achieved by carefully selecting and separating the patient data into different sets, with each row in the spreadsheets representing a unique ICU patient. The binary variables used to describe the attributes of each patient further ensured that the datasets were independent, as these variables uniquely identified each patient's characteristics.\n\nThe distribution of the datasets in this study compares favorably to previously published machine learning datasets in the medical field. The use of synthetic datasets derived from actual data sources, such as the Japanese Nosocomial Infection Surveillance system, ensures that the datasets are both realistic and representative of real-world scenarios. This approach allows for the development of robust models that can be validated and tested with a sufficient number of actual patient patterns, relying on large volumes of data. In cases where the dataset is very reduced, a cross-validation scheme can be used for network validation to ensure the reliability of the results.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data used in this study are synthetic and derived from the Japanese Nosocomial Infection Surveillance system. The specific datasets, including the training and validation splits, are not publicly released in a forum. The synthetic datasets were constructed based on probability distributions and hazard ratios from existing studies, ensuring a realistic distribution of values.\n\nThe spreadsheets used in this research contain binary variables representing patient attributes, which were used to train and validate the artificial neural network. These spreadsheets were converted into pattern files compatible with the Java Neural Network Simulator (JavaNNS) using MATLAB. The pattern files, ICU trainingdata_NI.pat and ICU validationdata_NI.pat, are specific to this study and were not made publicly available.\n\nThe enforcement of data usage was managed through the controlled distribution of the synthetic datasets within the research team. The datasets were generated and used exclusively for the purposes of this study, adhering to ethical guidelines and ensuring patient privacy. The synthetic nature of the data mitigates concerns about data privacy and confidentiality, as the datasets do not contain real patient information.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in this study is supervised learning, specifically employing backpropagation algorithms. Two main variants were utilized: standard backpropagation and backpropagation with momentum. These algorithms are well-established in the field of neural networks and are not new. The choice of these algorithms was driven by their effectiveness in training multilayer neural networks, which are suitable for the task of predicting the risk of nosocomial infections in intensive care units.\n\nThe backpropagation with momentum algorithm showed superior performance compared to the standard backpropagation algorithm. This improvement was particularly notable when using parameter values derived from the xor.README file, as opposed to the default parameters. The momentum term helps accelerate convergence and can escape local minima more effectively, leading to better overall performance.\n\nThe decision to use these specific algorithms was based on their proven track record in similar problems and their availability in the Java Neural Network Simulator (JavaNNS). The study focused on demonstrating the application of these algorithms in a medical context, rather than introducing a new machine-learning algorithm. Therefore, publishing in a machine-learning journal was not the primary objective. Instead, the aim was to showcase the potential of neural networks in predicting nosocomial infections, using established methods and providing a didactic model for further development and improvement.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model presented in this publication does not function as a meta-predictor. It is a standalone artificial neural network designed specifically for predicting the risk of nosocomial infections in intensive care units. The network utilizes supervised learning and is trained using datasets derived from the Japanese Nosocomial Infection Surveillance system.\n\nThe model does not incorporate data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it relies on the backpropagation and backpropagation with momentum algorithms for training. These algorithms are employed to categorize patients based on their risk of nosocomial infection, using a set of predefined parameters.\n\nThe training data used in this model is synthetic and derived from a specific surveillance system. While the data is synthetic, the model's performance suggests that it could be effective with real-world data as well. The independence of the training data is not explicitly discussed in the context of a meta-predictor, as the model is not designed to combine predictions from multiple machine-learning methods. Therefore, the concept of independent training data in the context of a meta-predictor does not apply here.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data used in this study were derived from information provided by Barraclough et al., focusing on the risk factors for nosocomial infections. Each variable was assigned a binary value based on a probability distribution corresponding to its hazard ratio (HR), which depended on the patient's classification. This approach ensured that the training and validation datasets followed a realistic distribution of the involved values.\n\nThe spreadsheet used in the study contained rows representing individual ICU patients, with each column signifying quantifiable attributes that distinguish these patients. Binary variables were employed to indicate whether each patient possessed a particular attribute. These binary variables were crucial in describing the activity of both input and output neuronal units in the neural network.\n\nThe data were then imported into the Java Neural Network Simulator (JavaNNS) to execute the simulations. The neural network was designed to learn and categorize patients based on their selected attributes, determining whether they were at risk of nosocomial infections. The network's performance was evaluated using various backpropagation learning algorithms and parameter sets, with the goal of achieving optimal categorization of patients into risk categories.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In the optimization of our neural network model for predicting the risk of nosocomial infections in intensive care units, several parameters were utilized. The specific parameters included the learning rate (\u03b7), the maximum tolerated difference between target and actual output (dmax), the momentum term (\u03bc), and the flat spot elimination value (c). Additionally, the number of cycles for training was also a crucial parameter.\n\nThe selection of these parameters was guided by values that had previously shown success in training similar neural networks, particularly those used by Fischer et al. for solving the XOR problem. These values were found in the xor.README file of the JavaNNS examples and were also available as default settings in JavaNNS. The parameters from the xor.README file were chosen because they had been successfully used to train a neural network for the XOR problem, which shares some similarities with our model. It is important to note that these parameters were not derived from extensive statistical studies but were provided as starting points for training sessions.\n\nFor the backpropagation algorithm, the parameters included the learning rate (\u03b7) and dmax. For the backpropagation with momentum algorithm, additional parameters included the momentum term (\u03bc) and the flat spot elimination value (c). The number of cycles varied depending on the algorithm and the parameter set used, with values ranging from 100 to 2,000 cycles.\n\nThe specific values for these parameters are detailed in the simulations, where different combinations of learning functions and parameter sets were tested. For instance, the backpropagation with momentum algorithm using the xor.README file values had a learning rate of 3.0, dmax of 0.1, \u03bc of 0.8, c of 0.1, and 100 cycles. These values were chosen to optimize the performance of the network in predicting the risk of nosocomial infections.",
  "optimization/features": "The input features for the neural network were selected based on major patient-level risk factors associated with the development of nosocomial infections. These factors were chosen according to a study that utilized the JANIS database, focusing on patients aged 16 years or more who had remained in the ICU for 48 to 1,000 hours, had not been moved to another ICU, and had not been infected within 2 days after ICU admission.\n\nThe specific input features used include:\n\n* Sex (Male=1; Female=0)\n* Age categories (e.g., Age 16-44 Yes=1; no=0)\n* Severity of illness, measured by APACHE II score categories (e.g., APACHE II score 0-10 Yes=1; no=0)\n* Operation status (Yes=1; no=0)\n* Device use, such as ventilator use, urinary catheter, and central venous catheter (Yes=1; no=0)\n\nThese features were converted into binary variables, representing whether each patient possesses each attribute. The selection of these factors was based on a multivariate analysis that determined hazard ratios for the various factors selected.\n\nThe number of input features (f) used is 12. Feature selection was performed using a study that revealed the risk factors associated with the development of nosocomial infections. This selection was done using the training set only, as the factors were chosen based on a multivariate analysis of the training data.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study utilized neural networks trained with backpropagation and backpropagation with momentum algorithms. The parameters for these algorithms were derived from the xor.README file and default values in JavaNNS, which were previously used successfully for the XOR problem.\n\nThe number of parameters in the neural network was not excessively large compared to the number of training points. Specifically, the network was trained and validated using 15 training patterns and 6 validation patterns. This relatively small dataset helped mitigate the risk of overfitting, as the model had a limited number of parameters to adjust.\n\nTo further ensure that overfitting was not an issue, the performance of the network was evaluated using a validation set. The mean squared error (MSE) for the validation set was monitored, and the training was stopped when the MSE reached a very small value, indicating that the network had generalized well to the validation data. Additionally, the network's performance was assessed using a confusion matrix, which showed that the network correctly classified all patterns in both the training and validation sets.\n\nUnderfitting was ruled out by achieving a high accuracy in both the training and validation sets. The network's ability to correctly classify all patterns indicated that it had learned the underlying patterns in the data without being too simplistic. The use of different learning functions and parameter sets also helped in finding the optimal configuration that avoided underfitting.\n\nIn summary, the fitting method involved careful selection of parameters, monitoring of validation performance, and evaluation using a confusion matrix. These steps ensured that the network neither overfitted nor underfitted the data, leading to a robust and accurate model for predicting the risk of nosocomial infections in intensive care units.",
  "optimization/regularization": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters used in this study are available and reported in the publication. Specifically, the values of the parameters used in the simulations are detailed in a table within the paper. These parameters were derived from the xor.README file of the JavaNNS examples and the default values provided in JavaNNS.\n\nThe configurations include settings for learning functions such as backpropagation and backpropagation with momentum. The parameters listed include learning rate (\u03b7), maximum delta (dmax), momentum coefficient (\u03bc), and the number of cycles. For instance, the backpropagation with momentum using the xor.README file values includes a learning rate of 3.0, a maximum delta of 0.1, a momentum coefficient of 0.8, and 100 cycles.\n\nThe results of these configurations are also presented, showing the mean squared error (MSE) for both the training and validation sets. This information is crucial for replicating the experiments and understanding the performance of the neural network models used.\n\nThe content of this publication is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which allows for the sharing and adaptation of the material, provided that appropriate credit is given. This ensures that the configurations and parameters are accessible to the research community for further study and application.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model presented in this publication is not inherently transparent and can be considered a black box to some extent. Artificial neural networks, by their nature, are complex systems with multiple layers and nodes, making it challenging to interpret the exact reasoning behind their predictions. The model uses supervised learning algorithms, specifically backpropagation, to adjust weights and minimize errors, but this process does not provide clear, human-understandable rules or decision paths.\n\nHowever, efforts can be made to enhance interpretability. For instance, the use of logistic regression in conjunction with neural networks, as seen in some related studies, can help in understanding the contribution of individual risk factors. Additionally, techniques such as sensitivity analysis, where the impact of varying input factors on the output is studied, can provide insights into the model's behavior. Visualization tools can also be employed to map out the decision boundaries and understand how different inputs influence the final prediction.\n\nIn the context of this model, the synthetic datasets derived from actual databases allow for a controlled environment to study the effects of various risk factors on the prediction of nosocomial infections. By analyzing the performance of different backpropagation algorithms and parameter settings, one can gain a better understanding of how the model learns and categorizes patients. This iterative process of simulation and analysis helps in refining the model and making it more interpretable over time.",
  "model/output": "The model developed is a classification model. It is designed to categorize patients based on their risk of nosocomial infection in intensive care units. The output of the neural network provides a binary classification, indicating whether a patient is at risk of developing a nosocomial infection or not. This classification is achieved through supervised learning, where the network is trained on synthetic datasets derived from actual medical data. The final output is a decision made by the network after processing the input data through a series of weighted sums and activation functions, specifically using a sigmoid function to produce activation values within a defined range. The model's performance is evaluated based on its ability to correctly categorize patients into their respective risk groups, demonstrating high accuracy and no failures in the categorization process during the simulations.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "The source code for the neural network model is not explicitly released in this publication. However, the simulations were performed using the Java Neural Network Simulator (JavaNNS), which is a publicly available tool. The JavaNNS user manual, version 1.1, can be accessed online, providing detailed instructions on how to use the simulator. This manual is available at the University of T\u00fcbingen's website.\n\nThe datasets used for training and validation were derived from the Japanese Nosocomial Infection Surveillance system and were constructed based on information from Barraclough et al. These datasets follow a realistic distribution of the values involved and are used to categorize patients into categories of present and absent risk of nosocomial infections.\n\nFor those interested in replicating the study or using similar methods, the replication data for the neural network model is available on Harvard Dataverse. This dataset, version 1, can be accessed via the provided DOI, allowing researchers to reproduce the findings or adapt the model for their own purposes.\n\nWhile the specific source code for the neural network model is not provided, the use of JavaNNS and the availability of the replication data offer a pathway for others to implement and build upon the methods described in this publication.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method for this study involved several key steps to ensure the robustness and accuracy of the neural network model designed to predict the risk of nosocomial infections in intensive care units. Initially, the trained artificial neural network (ANN) was evaluated using a confusion matrix, which provided a visual representation of the network's performance by comparing predicted outcomes with actual outcomes. This matrix helped in understanding the success and failure rates of the network's predictions.\n\nTo account for the randomness inherent in the training process, ten simulations were conducted for each learning algorithm and set of parameters. The results were compared through the sum of squared errors (SSE) displayed in the Log and Error graph windows. This approach allowed for a comprehensive analysis of the model's performance across multiple trials.\n\nThe validation set played a crucial role in the evaluation process. During training, the error of the validation set was simultaneously monitored and displayed as a pink line in the Error graph window. This real-time feedback helped in assessing how well the model generalized to unseen data.\n\nAfter training, the update mode topological order was used to pass the training and validation patterns one by one through the network. Each pattern was visualized both numerically and by colors in all neurons of the network, allowing for a detailed observation of the network's success or failure with each input pattern.\n\nThe classification results for the training and validation patterns were presented in a table, showing the number of successes and failures. A pattern was classified correctly into present risk of nosocomial infections if the output unit activation was \u22650.6, and into absent risk if the activation was \u22640.4. The confusion matrix further validated the network's performance by comparing the most likely prediction state for each pattern with the true value of the output unit activation.\n\nOverall, the evaluation method ensured a thorough assessment of the model's predictive accuracy and reliability, providing a solid foundation for further refinement and application in real-world scenarios.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our neural network model for predicting the risk of nosocomial infections in intensive care units, several performance metrics were employed to assess the model's effectiveness. The primary metric reported is the Mean Squared Error (MSE), which measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual outcomes. This metric was calculated for both the training and validation sets, providing insights into the model's performance during training and its generalization to unseen data.\n\nAdditionally, the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) was used to compare the results across different learning algorithms and parameter sets. The SSE represents the cumulative squared differences between the predicted and actual outputs for all patterns in the training and validation sets. This metric was particularly useful in visualizing the error reduction over training cycles through graphical representations.\n\nThe classification performance of the model was evaluated using success and failure rates for both training and validation patterns. A pattern was considered correctly classified if the output unit activation met specific thresholds: \u22650.6 for present risk and \u22640.4 for absent risk of nosocomial infections. This binary classification approach allowed for a clear assessment of the model's accuracy in predicting infection risk.\n\nFurthermore, a confusion matrix was utilized to provide a detailed breakdown of the model's predictions against the actual outcomes. This matrix displayed the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, offering a comprehensive view of the model's predictive performance. The confusion matrix is a standard and representative metric in the literature, widely used for evaluating classification models.\n\nThe model's performance was also assessed through multiple simulations, with ten trials conducted for each combination of learning algorithms and parameter sets. This approach ensured robustness and reliability in the reported metrics, as it accounted for the randomness inherent in the training process.\n\nIn summary, the reported performance metrics\u2014MSE, SSE, classification success rates, and the confusion matrix\u2014are representative and align with established practices in the literature. These metrics collectively provide a thorough evaluation of the model's ability to predict the risk of nosocomial infections accurately.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In the evaluation of our neural network model for predicting the risk of nosocomial infections in intensive care units, we employed several learning algorithms and parameter sets to assess their performance. The backpropagation and backpropagation with momentum algorithms were utilized, with parameters derived from both the xor.README file and the default settings in JavaNNS. These parameters were chosen based on successful training of similar neural networks, although they were not extensively validated for statistical significance.\n\nTo ensure a comprehensive evaluation, ten simulations were conducted for each combination of learning algorithms and parameter sets. The results were compared through the sum of squared errors (SSE) in both the training and validation sets. The SSE values were visualized in the Error graph window, with an additional pink line representing the error of the validation set. This approach allowed us to observe the performance of each model configuration over multiple trials.\n\nThe performance of the models was further evaluated using a confusion matrix, which provided a detailed classification of the training and validation patterns. Patterns were classified as having a present or absent risk of nosocomial infections based on the output unit activation. The confusion matrix helped us assess the accuracy of the predictions by comparing the predicted outcomes with the actual outcomes.\n\nThe backpropagation with momentum algorithm, particularly with the xor.README file parameter values, demonstrated the best performance. This configuration showed an almost nil error and successfully classified all patterns in both the training and validation sets. However, it is important to note that these parameters should not be considered optimal for all scenarios, as they were initially used for a different problem and may require further tuning for specific applications.\n\nIn summary, our evaluation involved a thorough comparison of different learning algorithms and parameter sets, using both synthetic and real data patterns. The backpropagation with momentum algorithm with the xor.README file values emerged as the most effective configuration for predicting the risk of nosocomial infections in intensive care units. Future work may involve testing additional backpropagation learning functions, such as Quickprop or Resilient propagation, and incorporating more input variables and hidden layers to enhance the model's predictive accuracy.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the neural network's performance in predicting the risk of nosocomial infections in intensive care units was conducted using several metrics, including the sum of squared errors (SSE) and mean squared error (MSE). The SSE decreased progressively until it reached 0.0 at 100 cycles, indicating a very small MSE of 0.011535088. This suggests that the network's performance was highly accurate.\n\nThe classification results, presented in a table, showed that the network correctly classified all training and validation patterns. Specifically, for the backpropagation with momentum algorithm using the xor.README file values, the error was almost nil, demonstrating the network's high accuracy.\n\nThe confusion matrix further supported these findings, showing that the network's predictions aligned perfectly with the actual outcomes. This matrix indicated that the network successfully identified all cases of present and absent risk of nosocomial infections without any failures.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the parameters used, particularly those from the xor.README file, were not obtained through extensive statistical studies but were provided as hints to start training sessions. Therefore, while the results are promising, they should not be cited as optimal or used in comparisons of network simulators without further validation.\n\nThe study also acknowledged the need for larger datasets and more complex models to fully evaluate the network's performance in real-world scenarios. The use of a synthetic dataset limited the statistical significance of the results, and future work should include a validation set of real cases to ensure the robustness of the findings.\n\nIn summary, while the performance metrics indicate high accuracy and confidence in the network's predictions, the lack of extensive statistical validation and the use of a synthetic dataset mean that the results should be interpreted with caution. Further testing with real data and more rigorous statistical analysis is necessary to confirm the network's superiority over other methods and baselines.",
  "evaluation/availability": "The raw evaluation files used in this study are not publicly available. The evaluation was conducted using synthetic datasets derived from the Japanese Nosocomial Infection Surveillance system. These datasets were specifically created for the purpose of this research and were not released publicly. The study utilized two pattern files, ICU trainingdata_NI.pat and ICU validationdata_NI.pat, which were generated using MATLAB. These files were used for training and validating the neural network, respectively. The validation process involved determining the performance of the artificial neural network on patterns that were not included in the training set. However, these files and the raw data used to create them are not accessible to the public."
