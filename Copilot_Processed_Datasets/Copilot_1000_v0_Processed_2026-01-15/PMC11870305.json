  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study originates from experimental forests established in the spring of 2009 at three different sites. These sites were part of a long-term study focusing on the growth traits of C. bungei clones. The dataset includes measurements of various growth traits such as height, diameter at breast height (DBH), and volume, collected over multiple years. Due to natural deaths, missing records, and other factors, the number of plants investigated at each site was inconsistent. The survival rate of clonal lines is detailed in a figure within the publication.\n\nThe dataset encompasses a significant number of data points, reflecting the growth traits of numerous clonal lines across different sites and years. This comprehensive dataset allows for a detailed analysis of genetic and environmental effects on the growth of C. bungei clones. The analysis of variance and multiple comparison analyses were carried out using R software version 4.1.3, with the lme4-R software package used to estimate genetic parameters, including best linear unbiased estimation (BLUP), variance components of genetic effects, and repeatability.\n\nThe dataset has been utilized to explore environment (site) and genotype by environment (G \u00d7 E) effects across sites. The study employed multivariate regression tree (MRT) analysis to assess the combined effects of multiple environmental factors on clonal growth. Additionally, Spearman's correlation and regression analysis were conducted to identify the main environmental factors affecting the growth traits of C. bungei clones. The dataset has also been used to estimate environmental variation coefficients for growth traits at the three sites, providing insights into the impact of environmental factors on clonal growth.\n\nThe dataset has not been previously published or used by the community in other studies. However, the methods and analyses described in this publication can serve as a foundation for future research on the genetic improvement and environmental adaptation of C. bungei clones. The detailed validation mode of MRT and the specific formulas used for calculations are referenced in previous studies, ensuring the reliability and reproducibility of the findings.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used is a regression tree, specifically a multivariate regression tree (MRT). This technique extends the univariate regression tree to handle multiple response variables with nonlinear relationships and missing values. It is particularly useful for analyzing complex ecological data, such as exploring, describing, and predicting the relationships between species data and environmental characteristics.\n\nThe MRT analysis was conducted using the R package mvpart. A 10-fold cross-validation procedure was performed to determine the optimal tree size and to avoid model overfitting. This approach ensures that the model generalizes well to new data and is not overly complex.\n\nThe use of MRT in this context is not new, as it has been previously applied in ecological studies. The focus of this work is on applying MRT to analyze the genetic, environmental, and genotype-environment interaction effects on tree growth traits. The algorithm's application in this specific domain of forestry research is what makes it relevant to this study.\n\nThe decision to use MRT in this particular study is driven by its ability to handle the complexities of ecological data, including multiple response variables and nonlinear relationships. This makes it a suitable choice for analyzing the interactions between genetic factors, environmental conditions, and tree growth traits. The results of the MRT analysis provide insights into the genetic gain of growth traits for excellent clones, which is crucial for selecting high-yielding and stable clones for forestry applications.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employs a multivariate regression tree (MRT) analysis, which is a machine learning technique that extends univariate regression trees. This method is capable of handling multiple response variables with nonlinear relationships and missing values. It is particularly useful for analyzing complex ecological data, especially for exploring, describing, and predicting the relationships between species data and environmental characteristics.\n\nThe MRT analysis used in this study was conducted using the R package mvpart. A 10-fold cross-validation procedure was performed to determine the optimal tree size and to avoid model overfitting. This approach ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data.\n\nThe MRT analysis is not a meta-predictor in the traditional sense, as it does not directly use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it operates on the raw data to build a regression tree that captures the relationships between the response variables and the predictors. The training data used in the MRT analysis is independent, as the 10-fold cross-validation procedure ensures that each fold of the data is used for both training and validation, preventing data leakage and ensuring robust model performance.\n\nThe MRT analysis is a standalone method that does not rely on the outputs of other machine-learning algorithms. It is designed to handle complex ecological data and provide insights into the relationships between species data and environmental characteristics. The use of cross-validation further ensures that the model is reliable and generalizable.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, data encoding and preprocessing were crucial steps to ensure the effectiveness of the machine-learning algorithms employed. For the multivariate regression tree (MRT) analysis, we utilized the R package mvpart. This package extends univariate regression trees to handle multiple response variables, accommodating nonlinear relationships and missing values. A 10-fold cross-validation procedure was performed to determine the optimal tree size and to mitigate model overfitting.\n\nFor the correlation analysis, we conducted Spearman correlation analysis using SPSS 22.0 software. This method allowed us to assess the relationships between environmental factors and traits. Additionally, we calculated the absolute value of the differences in environmental factors between different regions each year to quantify changes in environmental factors. The strength of the correlation between these changes and the B-type genetic correlation of traits between corresponding regions was used to measure the impact of environmental factor changes on the genotype by environment (G \u00d7 E) effect.\n\nMantel correlation analysis was performed using the vegan and ggcor packages in the R language to analyze the correlation between trait genetic correlations and environmental factor variables. This approach provided a comprehensive understanding of how environmental factors influence genetic traits.\n\nFor the genotype by environment (G \u00d7 E) interaction analysis, we constructed GGE biplots using the first two principal components derived from the environment-centered best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) values of tree height and volume at 5 years old, and diameter at breast height (DBH) at 9 years old of each clone at each site. These biplots were constructed using a singular-value decomposition model, which helped visualize the interactions between genotypes and environments.\n\nOverall, the data encoding and preprocessing steps were designed to ensure that the machine-learning algorithms could effectively analyze the complex relationships between environmental factors and genetic traits.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the model utilized several key parameters to estimate various genetic and environmental effects. The primary parameters included in the model are those related to the observed values of the clones, fixed effects, random effects, and residual effects.\n\nThe observed value of an individual clone is represented by y, which is influenced by multiple factors. The fixed effects include the average of the population (\u03bc) and the fixed effect of the block (B). Random effects encompass the clonal effect (C) and the residual effect (e). These effects are modeled using normally independent distributions with specific variances.\n\nFor single-site analysis, the model is defined as y = \u03bc + B + C + e, where each term represents the respective effect on the observed value. In multi-site analysis, additional terms are included to account for site-specific effects, such as the fixed effect of the site (S) and the interaction between the clone and the site (CS). The multi-site model is expressed as y = \u03bc + S + C + BS + CS + e.\n\nThe selection of parameters was guided by the need to capture both genetic and environmental variations accurately. The clonal effect (C) and its interaction with the site (CS) are crucial for understanding genetic parameters and genotype-by-environment interactions. The residual effect (e) accounts for unexplained variability, ensuring a comprehensive model.\n\nThe number of parameters (p) used in the model varies depending on the complexity of the analysis. For single-site analysis, the model includes four main parameters: \u03bc, B, C, and e. In multi-site analysis, additional parameters such as S and CS are included, increasing the total number of parameters. The specific number of parameters can be adjusted based on the data and the research objectives, ensuring that the model is both parsimonious and informative.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized a comprehensive set of input features to analyze the growth traits of C. bungei clones across different environments. The specific number of features (f) used as input is not explicitly stated, but it is clear that we considered multiple environmental factors and growth traits. These factors included temperature differences, climatic moisture deficit, mean coldest month temperature, and degree-days below 18\u00b0C, among others. Additionally, we analyzed growth traits such as height, diameter at breast height (DBH), and volume.\n\nFeature selection was implicitly performed through the use of multivariate regression tree (MRT) analysis and Spearman's correlation analysis. These methods helped identify the most significant environmental factors affecting the growth traits. For instance, temperature difference (TD), climatic moisture deficit (CMD), mean coldest month temperature (MCMT), and degree-days below 18\u00b0C (DD < 18) were found to be the primary environmental indicators influencing the growth of C. bungei clones.\n\nThe feature selection process was conducted using the entire dataset, ensuring that the most relevant factors were identified for further analysis. This approach helped in reducing the dimensionality of the data and focusing on the key environmental variables that have a substantial impact on the growth traits of the clones. By doing so, we aimed to enhance the accuracy and reliability of our models in predicting the growth performance of different clones under varying environmental conditions.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed several statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze the data, ensuring that both overfitting and underfitting were appropriately addressed.\n\nThe number of parameters in our models was not excessively large compared to the number of training points. We used a combination of linear mixed models and multivariate regression trees (MRT), which are designed to handle complex datasets efficiently. For instance, the linear mixed models included fixed and random effects, which helped in capturing the variability in the data without overparameterization.\n\nTo rule out overfitting, we implemented a 10-fold cross-validation procedure, particularly for the MRT analysis. This technique helps in determining the optimal tree size and prevents the model from becoming too complex and fitting the noise in the data. Additionally, we used the lme4-R software package to estimate genetic parameters, which includes best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) and variance components. These methods are robust and help in avoiding overfitting by providing unbiased estimates.\n\nUnderfitting was addressed by ensuring that our models were sufficiently complex to capture the underlying patterns in the data. For example, the use of multivariate regression trees allowed us to handle multiple response variables with nonlinear relationships, which is crucial for ecological data. Furthermore, the general linear mixing model and the multi-site analysis equations were designed to account for various sources of variability, including genetic effects, environmental effects, and their interactions. This comprehensive approach ensured that our models were not too simplistic and could adequately capture the complexity of the data.\n\nIn summary, by using appropriate statistical methods, cross-validation techniques, and robust software packages, we were able to balance the complexity of our models, avoiding both overfitting and underfitting.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed a regularization technique to prevent overfitting. Specifically, we utilized a 10-fold cross-validation procedure. This method is particularly useful for determining the optimal tree size in our multivariate regression tree (MRT) analysis. By dividing the data into 10 subsets, we trained the model on 9 subsets and validated it on the remaining subset, repeating this process 10 times. This approach helps to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting. The cross-validation procedure is a robust technique for model validation and is widely used in machine learning to enhance the reliability and accuracy of predictive models.",
  "optimization/config": "Not applicable.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in our study is not a black box but rather a transparent and interpretable approach. We utilized the BLUP-GGE analysis, which combines the GGE biplot method with best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP). This integration allows for a clear and visual interpretation of genotype and environment interactions.\n\nOne of the key features of our model is the use of biplots, which provide a graphical representation of the data. These biplots help in visualizing the relationships between different genotypes and environments. For instance, in the 'discrimination vs representativeness' analysis, the blue arrow line segment represents the average environmental axis, and the length of the test point line segment indicates the discriminating power of the environment on the variety. The angle between the line segment and the average environmental axis shows the degree of representativeness of the target environment, with smaller angles indicating stronger representativeness.\n\nAdditionally, the 'which won where/what' module analysis identifies the best-performing clones within specific regions, represented by the clones at the four vertices of the polygon. The 'mean vs stability' analysis uses arrowed lines to represent the environmental mean axis, with the position of the arrow indicating the mean environmental value. The perpendicular line from the clone to the mean environmental axis (gray dashed line) represents the stability of the clone's traits, where longer lines indicate worse trait stability.\n\nThe 'rank genotype' analysis further enhances interpretability by using concentric circles made relative to the mean environmental axis. Clones closer to the center indicate better mean values and stability for their traits. These visualizations make it easier to understand the performance and stability of different genotypes across various environments.\n\nMoreover, we employed multivariate regression tree (MRT) analysis, a machine learning technique that extends the univariate regression tree. MRT can handle multiple response variables with nonlinear relationships and missing values, making it suitable for analyzing complex ecological data. This method helps in exploring, describing, and predicting the relationships between species data and environmental characteristics, providing a transparent and interpretable model.\n\nIn summary, our model is designed to be transparent and interpretable, utilizing visualizations and statistical methods that allow for a clear understanding of genotype and environment interactions. This transparency is crucial for accurately assessing and interpreting the data, ensuring that the findings are reliable and actionable.",
  "model/output": "The model discussed in the output subsection is primarily focused on regression techniques. Specifically, multivariate regression tree (MRT) analysis is highlighted as a machine learning method used to handle multiple response variables with nonlinear relationships and missing values. This technique is employed to analyze complex ecological data, particularly to explore, describe, and predict the relationships between species data and environmental characteristics. The MRT analysis was conducted using the R package mvpart, with a 10-fold cross-validation procedure to determine the optimal tree size and avoid model overfitting. Additionally, the output includes details on correlation analysis, which was performed using Spearman correlation analysis in SPSS 22.0 software to assess the relationship between environmental factors and traits. Mantel correlation analysis was also conducted using the vegan and ggcor packages in R to analyze trait genetic correlations and environmental factor variables. These analyses collectively contribute to understanding the impact of environmental factors on genetic correlations and the overall growth traits of the studied species.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time for the model varied depending on the specific analyses performed. The multivariate regression tree (MRT) analysis, for instance, involved a 10-fold cross-validation procedure to determine the optimal tree size and avoid model overfitting. This process is computationally intensive and can take a significant amount of time, especially when dealing with complex ecological data and multiple response variables.\n\nAdditionally, the analysis of variance and multiple comparison analyses were carried out using R software version 4.1.3, with the lme4-R software package used to estimate genetic parameters. These statistical analyses also required substantial computational resources and time, particularly when estimating variance components, best linear unbiased estimations (BLUP), and repeatability for each clone across different sites.\n\nThe correlation analysis, performed using SPSS 22.0 software and the vegan and ggcor packages in R, involved Spearman correlation analysis and Mantel correlation analysis. These analyses, while not as computationally intensive as the MRT analysis, still required a considerable amount of time to process the data and generate the results.\n\nOverall, the execution time for the model was influenced by the complexity of the data, the number of sites and clones analyzed, and the specific statistical methods employed. The use of advanced statistical techniques and software packages ensured the accuracy and reliability of the results, but it also contributed to the overall execution time.",
  "model/availability": "The source code for the multivariate regression tree (MRT) analysis is available through the R package mvpart, which can be accessed via the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). This package, version 1.6-2, is specifically designed for multivariate partitioning and can be retrieved from the CRAN repository. The package is open-source and can be used to perform MRT analysis, which is a machine learning technique suitable for handling multiple response variables with nonlinear relationships and missing values. Additionally, the analysis of variance and multiple comparison analyses were conducted using R software version 4.1.3, with the lme4-R software package utilized to estimate genetic parameters. The specific details and validation modes of the MRT analysis are referenced in previous studies, ensuring reproducibility and reliability of the methods used.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method employed in this study involved a comprehensive approach to assess the performance and stability of different genotypes across multiple environments. A key aspect of the evaluation was the use of multi-site trials, which allowed for the assessment of genotype-environment (G \u00d7 E) interactions. These trials were crucial for determining the yield levels and stability of genotypes, as well as for understanding the environmental factors driving these interactions.\n\nOne of the primary analytical methods used was the BLUP-GGE analysis, which combines the GGE (Genotype plus Genotype-by-Environment) biplot method with Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP). This approach provided a robust framework for evaluating the degree of genotype-environment interactions for forest tree traits. The BLUP values for each genotype at each locus were used, avoiding the constraints of fixed-effects models and providing more accurate predictions.\n\nThe study also utilized multivariate regression tree (MRT) analysis, a machine learning technique that can handle multiple response variables with nonlinear relationships and missing values. This method was particularly useful for analyzing complex ecological data and exploring the relationships between species data and environmental characteristics. A 10-fold cross-validation procedure was performed to determine the optimal tree size and to avoid model overfitting, ensuring the reliability of the results.\n\nAdditionally, correlation analysis was conducted using Spearman correlation analysis in SPSS 22.0 software. This analysis measured the impact of environmental factor changes on the G \u00d7 E effect by calculating the absolute value of the differences in environmental factors between different regions each year. The strength of the correlation between these changes and the B-type genetic correlation of traits between corresponding regions was used to assess the influence of environmental factors on genotype performance.\n\nThe evaluation also included the calculation of genetic gain, which was determined using the formula \u2206G = S * R / X, where R is the repeatability from multi-site tests, S is the selection differential, and X is the population mean. This formula provided a quantitative measure of the expected genetic improvement from the selection process.\n\nOverall, the evaluation method involved a combination of statistical and machine learning techniques, along with multi-site trials, to provide a thorough assessment of genotype performance and stability across different environments. This approach ensured that the selected superior clones, such as clone 1-1 for DBH and clone 22-03 for volume, were identified based on robust and reliable data.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed a comprehensive set of performance metrics to evaluate the growth traits of forest tree clones across multiple environments. These metrics included the best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) values, which were used to estimate the breeding values of clones for height, diameter at breast height (DBH), and volume. These BLUP values are crucial for identifying top-performing clones, such as clones 22-05, 19-01, and 22-03, which were ranked highest for height, DBH, and volume, respectively.\n\nWe also calculated the phenotypic coefficient of variation (CV), genetic variation coefficient (GCV), and environmental variation coefficient (ECV) to assess the variability and stability of the traits. The CV is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean value of a trait, providing insight into the relative variability of the trait. The GCV and ECV help in understanding the proportion of genetic and environmental influences on the trait variability.\n\nRepeatability, another key metric, was calculated to measure the consistency of clonal performance across different sites and years. This metric is essential for understanding the reliability of the observed trait values and for making informed breeding decisions.\n\nAdditionally, we used Type B genetic correlations to evaluate the genetic relationships between different environments. This metric is particularly important for assessing the stability of genotypes across varying environmental conditions.\n\nTo further explore the environmental factors influencing growth traits, we conducted Spearman correlation and regression analyses. These analyses helped identify the main environmental factors, such as temperature difference (TD), Hargreaves climatic moisture deficit (CMD), degree-days below 18\u00b0C (DD < 18), and mean coldest month temperature (MCMT), that significantly affect the growth of C. bungei clones.\n\nThe use of multivariate regression tree (MRT) analysis allowed us to assess the combined effects of multiple environmental factors on clonal growth. This method is particularly useful for handling complex ecological data and for predicting the relationships between species data and environmental characteristics.\n\nOverall, the set of performance metrics used in our study is representative of those commonly employed in forest genetics research. These metrics provide a robust framework for evaluating the genetic and environmental influences on tree growth traits, ensuring that our findings are both reliable and applicable to broader forest management and breeding strategies.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we evaluated several analytical methods to assess genotype-environment interactions for forest tree traits. These methods ranged from early approaches like joint regression-based stability analysis and Type-B genetic correlation to more recent techniques such as GGE biplot mapping and the combined BLUP-GGE analysis.\n\nWe did not perform a direct comparison to publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. Instead, we focused on the evolution and refinement of methodologies over time, highlighting how each method has contributed to the field. The joint regression-based stability analysis and Type-B genetic correlation were among the first approaches used. These were followed by more sophisticated methods like GGE biplot mapping, which has been widely applied due to its ability to consider both stability and productivity of varieties, along with its strong visualization capabilities.\n\nHowever, GGE biplot mapping faces challenges with unequal error variances, which can reduce the reliability of results. To address this, we employed the BLUP-GGE analysis, which combines GGE with best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP). This approach uses genetic effect values of traits for analysis, making it more reliable. By using BLUP values for each genotype at each locus, we avoided the constraints of fixed-effects models.\n\nIn addition to comparing advanced methods, we also considered simpler baselines. For instance, we used the membership function method to standardize heights, diameters at breast height (DBH), and volumes of clones over multiple years. This method allowed us to calculate comprehensive assessment values for clonal growth traits, which helped in ranking and selecting potential candidates for further evaluation.\n\nOverall, our evaluation involved a thorough examination of various methods, from early stability analyses to modern combined approaches, ensuring that we considered both complex and simpler baselines to accurately assess genotype-environment interactions.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of genotype-environment interactions and genetic parameters in our study was conducted with a strong emphasis on statistical rigor. We employed several analytical methods, including the combined BLUP-GGE analysis, which integrates best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) with genotype plus genotype-environment interaction (GGE) biplots. This approach allowed us to avoid the constraints of fixed-effects models and provided more reliable estimates of genetic effects.\n\nThe analysis of variance and multiple comparison analyses were performed using R software version 4.1.3, with the lme4-R software package utilized to estimate genetic parameters. This included best linear unbiased estimation (BLUP), variance components of genetic effects, and repeatability. The use of mixed models ensured that both fixed and random effects were appropriately accounted for, enhancing the robustness of our findings.\n\nStatistical significance was assessed throughout the study. For instance, the fixed effect analysis indicated that genetic factors significantly influenced growth variation. Additionally, the genotype-environment (G \u00d7 E) interactions were found to be substantial, particularly in subsequent years, with the G \u00d7 E variance component accounting for a significant portion of the variation in diameter at breast height (DBH) and volume.\n\nConfidence intervals were not explicitly mentioned for the performance metrics, but the use of BLUP values and the estimation of variance components provide a measure of uncertainty and variability in the genetic parameters. The repeatability estimates for different traits across sites further support the reliability of our results. For example, the repeatability of DBH in the ninth year was relatively high, reaching 0.72, indicating strong genetic control and consistency in measurements.\n\nOverall, the statistical methods employed in our study ensure that the results are robust and that the claims of superiority over other methods and baselines are well-supported. The detailed analysis of genetic and environmental effects, along with the use of advanced statistical techniques, provides a comprehensive evaluation of the genetic improvement potential in forest tree species.",
