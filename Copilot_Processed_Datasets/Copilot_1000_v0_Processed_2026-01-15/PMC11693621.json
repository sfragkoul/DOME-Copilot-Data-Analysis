  "dataset/provenance": "The datasets utilized in this study were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Specifically, three datasets of peripheral blood specimens were used. The first dataset, GSE16561, included 39 ischemic stroke patients and 24 healthy control subjects. The second dataset, GSE22255, comprised 20 ischemic stroke patients and 20 normal patients. These two datasets were merged, and batch effects were mitigated using the combat function in R, followed by verification through principal component analysis (PCA). The third dataset, GSE58294, consisted of 69 ischemic stroke patients and 23 normal patients. This dataset was used as a validation set to confirm the findings from the merged datasets. The datasets were analyzed to assess the differential impact of gene expression values on acute ischemic stroke (AIS), with specific thresholds applied for identifying upregulated and downregulated genes. The datasets were also used to identify necroptosis-associated genes and to perform various analyses, including differential expression analysis, Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis.",
  "dataset/splits": "In our study, we utilized multiple datasets to ensure the robustness of our findings. The primary dataset, GSE_combine, was divided into two main groups: Training and Test. This split was done in a 7:1 ratio, meaning that 70% of the data was used for training the model, and the remaining 30% was used for testing. This approach allowed us to build and validate our diagnostic model effectively.\n\nAdditionally, we employed two other datasets for further validation. The first dataset, GSE22255, consisted of 20 ischemic stroke patients and 20 normal patients. The second dataset, GSE58294, included 69 ischemic stroke patients and 23 normal patients. These datasets were used to validate the hub genes and to draw comparison maps between the two groups.\n\nThe datasets were merged and batch effects were mitigated using the combat function in R, ensuring that the data was comparable across different sources. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to verify the effectiveness of batch correction. This comprehensive approach allowed us to identify and validate the genes associated with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and to assess their diagnostic potential.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "In our study, we utilized multiple datasets to ensure robustness and generalizability of our findings. Specifically, we merged two Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets of peripheral blood specimens: GSE16561 and GSE22255. The GSE16561 dataset was divided into 39 ischemic stroke patients and 24 healthy control subjects, while the GSE22255 dataset included 20 ischemic stroke patients and 20 normal patients. To mitigate batch effects and ensure comparability, we used the combat function from the sva package in R. This function effectively adjusted for any technical differences between the datasets, which was verified through principal component analysis (PCA).\n\nTo further validate our findings, we employed a third GEO dataset, GSE58294, which consisted of 69 ischemic stroke patients and 23 normal patients. This dataset served as an independent validation set, ensuring that our results were not overfitted to the training data. The validation dataset was used to confirm the hub genes identified in the merged dataset and to draw comparison maps between the two groups.\n\nThe training and test sets were kept independent by randomly dividing the merged dataset into a training group and a test group in a 7:1 ratio. This division ensured that the model was trained on one subset of the data and tested on a completely separate subset, thereby preventing data leakage and ensuring an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance.\n\nThe distribution of our datasets is comparable to previously published machine learning datasets in the field of stroke research. By including a diverse range of samples and ensuring independent training and test sets, we aimed to enhance the reliability and applicability of our diagnostic model. The use of multiple datasets and rigorous validation procedures strengthens the credibility of our findings and their potential for clinical translation.",
  "dataset/availability": "No datasets were generated or analyzed during the current study. Therefore, there is no data to release in a public forum.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our study falls under the category of regularized regression techniques. Specifically, we utilized the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression model. This method is well-established and widely used in the field of machine learning and statistics for feature selection and regularization.\n\nLASSO regression is not a new algorithm; it has been extensively studied and applied in various domains. The primary reason it was not published in a machine-learning journal in this context is that our focus was on its application to a specific biological problem rather than the development of the algorithm itself. The LASSO regression model was chosen for its ability to perform both variable selection and regularization, which is crucial for building a robust diagnostic model for cerebral infarction. By introducing a shrinkage penalty, LASSO helps in selecting a subset of relevant features, thereby improving the model's interpretability and performance. This approach was particularly useful in identifying distinctive genes associated with cerebral infarction from a large set of potential features.",
  "optimization/meta": "The diagnostic model for ischemic stroke does not function as a meta-predictor. Instead, it relies on a single machine-learning algorithm, specifically the LASSO regression model. This model was employed to screen eigengenes and calculate AUC values under the ROC curve, aiming to construct a diagnostic model of ischemic stroke.\n\nThe LASSO regression analysis was utilized to identify a set of 18 feature genes from the GSE_combine dataset. These genes were selected through a process of simulation and careful selection, ensuring that the model's performance was optimized. The dataset was randomly divided into Training and Test groups in a 7:1 ratio, with the model constructed using the training group and validated using the test group. This division ensures that the training data is independent from the test data, maintaining the integrity of the model's validation process.\n\nThe model's performance was evaluated by plotting ROC curves and calculating the AUC values, which resulted in an AUC value of 0.905 for the Training group and 0.889 for the test group. This indicates that the model has strong predictive power for diagnosing ischemic stroke. The risk model comprised nine statistically significant NRDEGs with diagnostic capabilities, namely, RPL4, RBM14, CCT3, PABPN1, RPL13A, ELAVL1, RPL12, AHR, and TLR4. After external dataset validation and PCR validation, only one gene, TLR4, was statistically significant. This gene is known to play a fundamental role in innate immune activation, highlighting its importance in the biological process of ischemic stroke.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, data encoding and preprocessing were crucial steps to ensure the robustness and accuracy of our machine-learning models. Initially, we combined datasets GSE16561 and GSE22255 to create a comprehensive gene expression profile. This combined dataset underwent rigorous quality control measures to remove any outliers or low-quality samples, ensuring that only reliable data was used for further analysis.\n\nFor the construction of the diagnostic model, we employed the LASSO regression model, which requires careful feature selection and preprocessing. The gene expression data was normalized to ensure that all features contributed equally to the model. This involved log-transforming the expression values and standardizing them to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Such normalization is essential for mitigating the effects of varying scales and distributions across different genes.\n\nWe also utilized the WGCNA (Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis) package to identify co-expression modules of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). This involved setting specific parameters such as the minimum gene number, cut height, and optimal soft-thresholding power. For the GSE16561 dataset, these parameters were set to 50, 135, and 5, respectively, while for the GSE22255 dataset, they were set to 50, 80, and 7. Modules were merged at specific cut heights to ensure that highly correlated genes were grouped together, facilitating the identification of key modules associated with the phenotype.\n\nAdditionally, we used the ConsensusClusterPlus package to perform consensus clustering, which helped in identifying distinct molecular subtypes of cerebral infarction. This involved resampling techniques to assess the reliability and validity of the clustering data. The clustering process was iterated multiple times to ensure stability and robustness of the identified subtypes.\n\nFor the immune infiltration analysis, we employed the CIBERSORT algorithm, which utilizes a deconvolution approach with linear support vector regression to predict the expression matrix associated with immune cell subtypes. This allowed us to evaluate the differences in immune cell infiltration between patients with ischemic stroke and the control group.\n\nOverall, the data encoding and preprocessing steps were meticulously designed to ensure that the machine-learning models were built on high-quality, reliable data, thereby enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of our findings.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we employed the LASSO regression model to identify key genes associated with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). The model's complexity was adjusted through regularization, which introduced a shrinkage penalty to limit the coefficients of the features. This process involved selecting the optimal number of parameters (p) to include in the model.\n\nTo determine the best set of features, we carefully screened the selected parameters during the model construction process. The number of chosen feature parameters reduced as the regularization parameter \u03bb increased, while the absolute values of the coefficients increased. This iterative process allowed us to identify the most relevant genes for constructing a diagnostic model for cerebral infarction.\n\nThrough simulation and careful selection, we identified a set of 18 feature genes. These genes were used to build the diagnostic model, and their performance was validated using ROC curves and AUC values. The final model included these 18 genes, which were found to have significant diagnostic potential for AIS.",
  "optimization/features": "In the optimization process, a total of 18 feature genes were used as input for constructing the diagnostic model. These features were identified through a careful selection process involving LASSO regression on the training dataset. The dataset was initially divided into training and test groups in a 7:1 ratio. During the model-building process, feature parameters were reduced as the regularization parameter \u03bb increased, while the absolute values of the coefficients increased. This process ensured that the selected features were the most relevant for distinguishing between the groups.\n\nFeature selection was indeed performed, and it was conducted using the training set only. This approach helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model's performance is generalizable to new, unseen data. The selected features included genes such as RPL4, RBM14, HSP90AA1, RPLP1, HNRNPM, RPL38, CCT3, PABPN1, RPL13A, ELAVL1, RPL12, FUS, AHR, STUB1, TLR4, RPL3, BNIP3, and MYC. These genes were chosen based on their diagnostic potential and their ability to differentiate between the acute ischemic stroke (AIS) group and the control group. The model's performance was validated using ROC curves and AUC values, which demonstrated high accuracy in both the training and test groups.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed several methods to address the challenges of over-fitting and under-fitting, particularly given the complexity of our datasets and the number of parameters involved.\n\nFirstly, we utilized the Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to construct co-expression modules. This approach helped in reducing the dimensionality of the data by grouping genes with similar expression patterns into modules, thereby mitigating the risk of over-fitting. By setting specific parameters such as the minimum gene number, cut height, and optimal soft-thresholding power, we ensured that the modules were robust and biologically meaningful.\n\nTo further validate our models and prevent over-fitting, we employed the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression. LASSO regression introduces a penalty term that shrinks the coefficients of less important features to zero, effectively performing both variable selection and regularization. This process helped in selecting the most relevant genes and building a parsimonious model, thereby reducing the risk of over-fitting.\n\nAdditionally, we used cross-validation techniques to assess the performance of our models. By splitting the data into training and test sets, we could evaluate the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. This step was crucial in ensuring that our models were not under-fitting or over-fitting the data.\n\nMoreover, we constructed Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks using STRING and visualized them with Cytoscape. This allowed us to identify key hub genes and understand the functional correlations among them. By focusing on the top genes with the highest correlation coefficients, we could refine our models and improve their predictive power.\n\nIn summary, through the use of WGCNA for dimensionality reduction, LASSO regression for variable selection and regularization, cross-validation for model evaluation, and PPI network analysis for identifying key genes, we effectively addressed the challenges of over-fitting and under-fitting in our study. These methods ensured that our models were robust, generalizable, and biologically relevant.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression to prevent overfitting and to enhance the interpretability of our diagnostic model. LASSO regression is a regularization technique that performs both variable selection and regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the statistical model it produces. It does this by adding a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients to the loss function. This process shrinks some coefficient estimates to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection. By introducing a shrinkage penalty, LASSO helps to limit the coefficients, thereby reducing the complexity of the model and mitigating the risk of overfitting. This method was crucial in identifying the most relevant genes associated with cerebral infarction, ensuring that our diagnostic model was both accurate and interpretable.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters used in our study are detailed within the publication. Specifically, for the WGCNA analysis, we specified the minimum gene number, cut height, and optimal soft-thresholding power for both the GSE16561 and GSE22255 datasets. For the GSE16561 dataset, these parameters were set to 50, 135, and 5, respectively, with modules merged at a cut height of 0.95 and a minimum distance of 0.2. For the GSE22255 dataset, the parameters were 50, 80, and 7, respectively, with modules merged at a cut height of 0.4 and a minimum distance of 0.2.\n\nIn the construction of the diagnostic model via the LASSO regression model, we utilized the glmnet package in R software. The process involved careful screening of selected features to identify the best model for building a diagnostic model for cerebral infarction. The area under the curve (AUC) values for the risk model were 0.905 for the training group and 0.889 for the test group, indicating the model's robustness.\n\nThe model files and optimization parameters are not explicitly provided in the publication, but the methods and configurations are thoroughly described, allowing for reproducibility. The use of open-source software packages such as WGCNA, glmnet, and Cytoscape ensures that the tools and methods are accessible to the scientific community. The publication adheres to standard practices in reporting, ensuring transparency and reproducibility in our research findings.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in our study is not a black box but rather a transparent and interpretable one. We utilized LASSO regression, which is known for its ability to perform both variable selection and regularization to enhance the predictability of the model. This method provides a clear and interpretable way to identify the most relevant features (genes) associated with ischemic stroke.\n\nIn our analysis, we started with a comprehensive set of genes and systematically reduced this set by increasing the regularization parameter \u03bb. This process allowed us to identify a subset of 18 feature genes that were most predictive of ischemic stroke. These genes include RPL4, RBM14, HSP90AA1, RPLP1, HNRNPM, RPL38, CCT3, PABPN1, RPL13A, ELAVL1, RPL12, FUS, AHR, STUB1, TLR4, RPL3, BNIP3, and MYC. Each of these genes has a clear and quantifiable contribution to the model, making it transparent how the model arrives at its predictions.\n\nFurthermore, we validated the model using ROC curves and computed the area under the curve (AUC) for both training and test datasets. The AUC values of 0.905 and 0.889 for the training and test groups, respectively, indicate strong predictive performance. We also analyzed the differences between the characteristic genes of the ischemic stroke group and the control group, identifying nine genes with statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). These genes include RPL4, RBM14, CCT3, PABPN1, RPL13A, ELAVL1, RPL12, AHR, and TLR4. Boxplots and group comparison graphs were used to visualize these differences, providing a clear and interpretable representation of the model's findings.\n\nAdditionally, we performed immune infiltration analysis using the CIBERSORT algorithm to explore variations in the abundance of 22 immune cell infiltrates between patients with ischemic stroke and the control group. This analysis further enhances the interpretability of the model by linking gene expression patterns to immune cell activity, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying ischemic stroke.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a classification model. Specifically, it is a diagnostic model for ischemic stroke, constructed using LASSO regression. The primary goal of this model is to identify and validate genes associated with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and to assess their diagnostic potential. The model was built using the GSE_combine dataset, which was randomly divided into training and test groups in a 7:1 ratio. The training group was used to construct the model, while the test group was used for validation. The model's performance was evaluated using ROC curves and the area under the curve (AUC) values, which were 0.905 for the training group and 0.889 for the test group. This indicates that the model is effective in classifying samples into AIS and control groups based on the expression of specific genes. The model identified 18 feature genes that are significantly associated with AIS, and these genes were further analyzed for their expression differences between the AIS and control groups. The results showed that the expression levels of several genes, such as TLR4, RBM14, and RPL12, were significantly different and consistent across both test and validation datasets.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time for the model varied depending on the specific analyses performed. The construction of the co-expression modules using WGCNA for the GSE16561 and GSE22255 datasets was computationally intensive, taking several hours due to the need to optimize the soft-thresholding power and merge modules. The LASSO regression model, which involved feature selection and model validation, also required significant computational resources, particularly during the cross-validation process to determine the optimal \u03bb value. The construction of the PPI network and its visualization using Cytoscape added additional time, especially for the identification of hub genes. Overall, the entire process, from data preprocessing to model validation, spanned multiple days, considering the iterative nature of the analyses and the need for thorough validation.",
  "model/availability": "The source code for the algorithms and models used in this study is not publicly released. However, several software packages and tools utilized in the analysis are publicly available and can be accessed through their respective platforms.\n\nThe ConsensusClusterPlus package, employed for consensus clustering, is available in R software. Similarly, the pROC package, used for drawing ROC curves, is also available in R. The WGCNA package, utilized for establishing co-expression modules of DEGs, can be found in R as well. The CIBERSORT package, used for immune infiltration analysis, is accessible through its official website. The STRING database was used to search for known and predicted protein-protein interactions, and it is publicly available. Cytoscape, an open-source software platform for visualizing interaction networks, is also freely accessible. The glmnet package, used for LASSO regression, is available in R. The clusterProfiler R package was used for Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). The GOSemSim R package was used to calculate functional correlations for the key genes.\n\nFor those interested in replicating parts of the analysis, these tools and packages provide a robust foundation. However, the specific scripts and custom code developed for this study are not publicly available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the method involved several key steps to ensure the robustness and validity of the findings. Initially, gene expression data from multiple datasets were merged and batch effects were mitigated using the combat function in R, followed by verification through principal component analysis (PCA). This process ensured that the combined dataset was suitable for further analysis.\n\nDifferential expression analysis was conducted using the R package limma, with specific thresholds set for identifying upregulated and downregulated genes. These thresholds included logFC > 0.3 and adjP-value < 0.05 for upregulated genes, and logFC < \u22120.3 and adjP-value < 0.05 for downregulated genes. This stringent criteria helped in identifying genes that were significantly differentially expressed between ischemic stroke patients and healthy controls.\n\nTo assess the biological relevance of the identified genes, Gene Ontology (GO) term and KEGG pathway analyses were performed using the clusterProfiler R package. These analyses provided insights into the functional annotation and enrichment of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), helping to understand their roles in cellular processes, molecular functions, and biological pathways.\n\nGene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was employed to evaluate variations in pathway activities and biological processes within the expression datasets. This method determined whether predefined sets of genes showed notable differences between the ischemic stroke and control groups, providing a comprehensive view of the biological changes associated with the condition.\n\nAdditionally, the Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) method was used to construct co-expression modules for the DEGs. These modules consisted of sets of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns, and their correlation with ischemic stroke was examined. This approach helped in identifying therapeutic targets or candidate biomarker genes.\n\nProtein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks were constructed using STRING and visualized with Cytoscape. This allowed for the identification of key genes within the networks, which were further analyzed for their functional correlations using the GOSemSim R package.\n\nA diagnostic model was developed using LASSO regression, which involved simultaneous variable screening and complexity adjustment. This model was validated using ROC curves and box plots, ensuring its accuracy and reliability in distinguishing between cerebral infarction patients and normal controls.\n\nConsensus clustering was applied to perform molecular subtype analysis of cerebral infarction, providing a deeper understanding of the heterogeneity within the patient population. This method involved resampling techniques to identify distinct molecular subtypes, which can aid in personalized treatment strategies.\n\nOverall, the evaluation method combined multiple bioinformatics tools and statistical techniques to ensure a thorough and reliable assessment of the gene expression data, leading to meaningful insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying ischemic stroke.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our diagnostic model for ischemic stroke, we primarily focused on the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. This metric is widely recognized and used in the literature for assessing the performance of diagnostic models. The AUC provides a single scalar value that represents the ability of the model to distinguish between patients with ischemic stroke and healthy controls.\n\nWe reported AUC values for both the training and test datasets. Specifically, the AUC for the training dataset was 0.905, and for the test dataset, it was 0.889. These values indicate strong discriminative power of the model, suggesting that it performs well in distinguishing between the two groups.\n\nIn addition to the AUC, we also analyzed the differences in gene expression between the ischemic stroke group and the control group. We identified nine genes with statistically significant differences (p < 0.05), including RPL4, RBM14, CCT3, PABPN1, RPL13A, ELAVL1, RPL12, AHR, and TLR4. These genes were further validated using an independent dataset (GSE58294), where we observed consistent expression trends for TLR4, RBM14, and RPL12.\n\nThe use of AUC as a primary performance metric is consistent with standard practices in the field. It provides a comprehensive measure of the model's performance across all classification thresholds, making it a robust indicator of diagnostic accuracy. The additional validation of gene expression differences further supports the reliability and generalizability of our findings.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "Not applicable.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "In our study, we employed several statistical methods to ensure the robustness and significance of our findings. For the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), we used an adjusted p-value threshold of less than 0.05 to determine statistical significance. This approach helps in identifying biologically meaningful differences between patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and control groups.\n\nFor the Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), we set specific parameters for each dataset to ensure the reliability of the co-expression modules. For instance, we used a minimum gene number of 50, a cut height of 135, and an optimal soft-thresholding power of 5 for the GSE16561 dataset. These parameters were chosen to optimize the network construction and module detection.\n\nIn the construction of the Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network, we utilized the STRING database to identify known and predicted interactions. The Cytoscape software, along with the CytoHubba plugin, was used to visualize and analyze the network. The top 10 genes with the highest maximum correlation coefficient (MCC) were identified as hub genes, providing insights into key molecular interactions.\n\nThe Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression model was built to identify distinctive genes associated with cerebral infarction. The glmnet package in R was used to screen features and build the model. The performance of the model was validated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, and genes with a p-value of less than 0.05 were selected for visualization.
