  "dataset/provenance": "The datasets utilized in this study were sourced from several publicly available databases. For the validation of our model, we incorporated the GSE53963 cohort, which includes 174 cases, for ROC analysis. Single-cell transcriptome sequencing data were obtained from the GEO database, specifically from the datasets GSE184880 and GSE213243. Spatial transcriptome data were acquired from the 10 \u00d7 Genomics database, accessible via a provided link.\n\nThe selection criteria for these datasets were stringent. The platforms used must cover a comprehensive range of genes, with fewer than 2 missing model genes. The datasets needed to exhibit high sequencing quality and provide detailed clinical information, including grade, stage, survival information, and pathological diagnosis. Additionally, the datasets had to include complete raw data, enabling a unified re-analysis, and the number of patients meeting the criteria should exceed 100. For single-cell datasets, the use of Chromium Single Cell 3\u2032 V3 Reagent Kits from 10 \u00d7 Genomics was required, with fewer than 20% low-quality cells and rich, representative cell types and clinical patient information.\n\nFurthermore, we collected serous ovarian cancer (SOC) and ovarian transcriptome data from TCGA-OV and GTEx, respectively, integrated with UCSC Xena. These datasets were used for variance analysis and the identification of differential genes. The TCGA and GEO databases are publicly available, and all datasets were downloaded directly from the indicated websites. The datasets and custom scripts used in this study are available upon request.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset splits include a training cohort and three validation cohorts. For the training cohort, 340 patients with serous ovarian cancer (SOC) were identified from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Regarding the validation cohorts, 79 patients were identified from GSE26193, 70 patients from GSE63885, and 276 patients from GSE140082. The distribution of data points in each split is as follows: 340 patients in the training cohort, 79 patients in the first validation cohort, 70 patients in the second validation cohort, and 276 patients in the third validation cohort.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets used in this study were carefully selected and split to ensure independence between training and test sets. For the training cohort, we identified 340 patients with serous ovarian cancer (SOC) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). For validation, we used three independent cohorts: 79 patients from GSE26193, 70 patients from GSE63885, and 276 patients from GSE140082. These validation cohorts were chosen to ensure that the model's performance could be assessed on diverse and independent datasets.\n\nTo enforce independence, we ensured that there was no overlap between the patients in the training set and those in the validation sets. This was achieved by selecting patients from different studies and databases, ensuring that the data used for training and testing were entirely distinct.\n\nThe distribution of the datasets compares favorably to previously published machine learning datasets in the field of ovarian cancer research. The criteria for dataset selection included comprehensive gene coverage, high sequencing quality, and the availability of detailed clinical information. This rigorous selection process ensured that the datasets were representative and of high quality, which is crucial for the reliability and generalizability of the model.\n\nAdditionally, we incorporated single-cell transcriptome sequencing data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GSE184880 and GSE213243) and spatial transcriptome data from the 10 \u00d7 Genomics database. These datasets were used to further validate the model and provide additional layers of biological insight. The single-cell data were processed using the Seurat package in R, with stringent quality control measures to ensure the integrity of the data. This multi-faceted approach to dataset selection and validation enhances the robustness and applicability of the findings.",
  "dataset/availability": "The datasets utilized in this study are publicly available. Specifically, the TCGA and GEO databases were used, which are accessible to the public. All datasets were directly downloaded from the respective websites. The datasets and custom scripts used in the analysis are available upon request. This ensures that other researchers can access and verify the data and methods used in our study. The availability of these datasets promotes transparency and reproducibility in scientific research.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model developed in this study is not a meta-predictor. It does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it is a predictive model based on programmed cell death (PCD)-related genes. The model incorporates multiple PCD genes and patterns to construct a cell death index (CDI) that serves as a reliable predictor. The CDI is calculated using a combination of univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, along with LASSO regression and stepwise Cox regression, to identify key genes associated with patient prognosis.\n\nThe model integrates various types of data, including genomics, single-cell transcriptomics, bulk transcriptomics, spatial transcriptomics, and clinical information. This multi-omics approach allows for a comprehensive analysis of tumor characteristics and the role of PCD in serous ovarian carcinoma (SOC). The CDI is then used to stratify patients into high and low-risk groups based on their survival outcomes.\n\nThe training and validation cohorts used in the study are independent. The training cohort consists of patients from the TCGA-OV dataset, while the validation cohorts include patients from the GSE26193, GSE63885, and GSE140082 datasets. This ensures that the model's performance is evaluated on separate, independent datasets, providing a robust assessment of its predictive accuracy.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the machine-learning algorithm, the data underwent several preprocessing steps to ensure optimal performance. Initially, single-cell transcriptome sequencing datasets were obtained from the GEO database. These datasets were merged, integrated, and processed using the R package Seurat. Quality control measures were implemented to remove cells with mitochondrial gene content over 25% and those with fewer than 500 or more than 6000 genes. Data normalization was performed using the NormalizeData function with standard parameters, followed by scaling with the ScaleData function. Highly variable features were identified using the FindVariableFeatures function, and principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted based on the 3000 most variable genes. Additionally, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) dimensionality reduction analysis was performed using the top 30 principal components to visualize the dataset.\n\nFor the construction of the survival prediction model, 779 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened to improve accuracy. The R package Survminer was used to identify 272 genes highly correlated with survival. Further refinement involved LASSO regression and stepwise Cox regression to obtain models consisting of 20 and 14 genes, respectively. The predict.coxph function of the R package Survival was utilized to output each patient\u2019s CDI, with the median number of CDI cases defining high and low CDI groups. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed for cluster discrimination of cells, and Kaplan\u2013Meier (KM) analysis was conducted using the R packages Survival and Survminer to investigate the relationship between CDI and survival. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed using the R package timeROC to evaluate the effectiveness of the CDI.\n\nFor functional enrichment analysis, DEGs between high and low CDI subgroups were analyzed using the R package limma. Pathway and process enrichment analyses were performed using MetaScape software, with ontology sources including KEGG Pathway, GO Biological Processes, Reactome Gene Sets, Canonical Pathways, CORUM, WikiPathways, and the PANTHER Pathway. Terms with a P-value < 0.01, a minimum count of three, and an enrichment factor > 1.5 were collected and grouped into clusters based on their membership similarities. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed using the R package GSVA, which allowed for the unsupervised estimation of pathway activity variation across a sample population. Gene sets, including \"c2.cp.kegg.v2023.1.Hs.symbols.gmt\" and \"c2.cp.reactome.v2023.1.Hs.symbols.gmt,\" were downloaded from MSigDB.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized a model based on 14 specific genes, which we refer to as the Cell Death Index (CDI). These genes were selected through a rigorous process involving differential expression analysis and survival correlation assessments.\n\nInitially, we screened 779 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) obtained via differential analysis. Using the R package Survminer, we identified 272 genes that were highly correlated with survival. Subsequently, we employed LASSO regression and stepwise Cox regression to refine this list, ultimately selecting 14 genes that formed the basis of our CDI model. This selection process ensured that the model parameters were both statistically significant and biologically relevant, providing a robust framework for predicting outcomes in serous ovarian carcinoma (SOC).\n\nThe CDI is calculated using a specific formula that incorporates the expression levels of these 14 genes, each weighted by a unique coefficient. This formula allows for the quantification of the CDI for each patient, which can then be used to stratify patients into high and low CDI groups based on the median value. This stratification has been shown to have prognostic significance, with patients in the high CDI group exhibiting poorer survival outcomes.",
  "optimization/features": "In the optimization process, we initially screened 779 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) obtained through differential analysis to enhance the accuracy of our prediction model. From these, we identified 272 genes that were highly correlated with survival using the R package Survminer. Subsequently, we employed LASSO regression and stepwise Cox regression to further refine this set, resulting in models consisting of 20 and 14 genes, respectively. These selected genes served as the input features for our survival prediction model.\n\nFeature selection was indeed performed, and it was conducted using the training set only to ensure that the model's performance was not biased by information from the test set. This approach helped in identifying the most relevant genes that contribute significantly to the prediction of survival outcomes in patients with serous ovarian cancer (SOC). The final models utilized these selected features to calculate the cell death index (CDI) for each patient, which was then used to define high and low CDI groups for further analysis.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed several methods to ensure that our models were neither overfitting nor underfitting the data. The number of parameters in our models was indeed larger than the number of training points, particularly when we initially screened 779 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). To address this, we used LASSO regression and stepwise Cox regression to reduce the number of genes in our models to 20 and 14, respectively. These techniques are effective in selecting a subset of relevant features and shrinking the coefficients of less important features, thereby mitigating overfitting.\n\nTo further validate our models and rule out overfitting, we performed cross-validation and evaluated the models using independent datasets. Specifically, we used the GSE63885 + GSE26193 and GSE140082 cohorts to confirm the consistency of our results with the TCGA-OV cohort. Additionally, we conducted time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis using the R package timeROC to assess the effectiveness of the CDI (Cancer Differentiation Index) across different time points.\n\nTo ensure that our models were not underfitting, we carefully selected the genes and pathways involved in our analyses. For instance, we performed functional enrichment analysis using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) to confirm the biological relevance of the DEGs. We also used Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) with the hallmark msigdb v2022.1 to identify differences in biological pathways between high and low CDI groups.\n\nMoreover, we constructed a nomogram that included clinical parameters such as age, stage, and grade, along with the CDI, to estimate overall survival (OS). The accuracy and feasibility of the nomogram were evaluated using calibration curves, decision curve analysis (DCA), and ROC analysis. These steps ensured that our models were robust and generalizable to new data.\n\nIn summary, we employed feature selection techniques, cross-validation, independent dataset validation, and comprehensive evaluation metrics to address the challenges of overfitting and underfitting in our models.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed regularization techniques to prevent overfitting in our predictive models. Specifically, we used LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression, which is a type of regularization that adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients. This method helps to shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively performing both variable selection and regularization. By doing so, LASSO regression reduces the complexity of the model and mitigates the risk of overfitting, especially when dealing with a large number of features relative to the number of observations.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized stepwise Cox regression, which is another technique to prevent overfitting. Stepwise regression involves iteratively adding or removing variables based on predefined criteria, such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). This process helps to identify the most relevant variables and exclude those that do not contribute significantly to the model, thereby enhancing its generalization ability.\n\nThese regularization methods were crucial in ensuring that our models, particularly the survival prediction model for PCD-related genes, were robust and could generalize well to new, unseen data.",
  "optimization/config": "The datasets and custom scripts used in our study are available upon request. This includes the gene expression profiles and other relevant data that were utilized for our analyses. The datasets were obtained from publicly available databases such as TCGA and GEO, which are accessible for research purposes. Additionally, the necessary clinical information, including grade, stage, survival information, and pathological diagnosis, is provided within these datasets. All statistical analyses were conducted using R software, and the specific packages and methods used, such as edgeR for variance analysis and maftools for somatic mutation data visualization, are detailed in the methods section. The workflow and methods, including the criteria for dataset selection and the steps involved in data processing, are thoroughly described to ensure reproducibility. The nomogram model and its components, including the CDI and clinical parameters, are also detailed, along with the performance evaluation metrics. However, specific hyper-parameter configurations and optimization schedules are not explicitly reported in the provided information.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in this study is not a black box but rather a transparent and interpretable one. The Cell Death Index (CDI) is calculated using a specific formula that incorporates the expression levels of 14 programmed cell death (PCD)-related genes. This formula is explicitly provided, allowing for clear interpretation of how each gene contributes to the overall index.\n\nThe formula for CDI is as follows:\n\nCDIscore= 0.16220\u2217RB1 expression\u2212 0.17038\u2217UBB expression\u2212 0.41386\u2217TRIM 27 expression+ 0.26017\u2217FANCD 2 expression+ 0.29119\u2217CD 38 expression+ 0.25412\u2217LEP Rexpression\u2212 0.40824 \u2217CAAP 1 expression+ 0.43810\u2217FADD expression+ 0.20286\u2217SNCA expression\u2212 0.22865\u2217BLOC 1S1 expression\u2212 0.26146\u2217AP 1S2 expression\u2212 0.27573\u2217SLC7A11 expression+ 0.12693\u2217DDIT 4 expression+ 0.09397\u2217TREM 2 expression\n\nEach term in this equation represents the contribution of a specific gene's expression level to the CDI, with positive coefficients indicating a positive contribution and negative coefficients indicating a negative contribution. This transparency allows researchers and clinicians to understand the biological significance of the CDI and how it relates to the underlying molecular mechanisms of serous ovarian carcinoma (SOC).\n\nAdditionally, the model's performance and the CDI's prognostic significance have been validated through various analyses, including univariate and multivariate Cox regression, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. These analyses provide further evidence of the model's interpretability and reliability.\n\nIn summary, the CDI-based model is transparent and interpretable, with a clear formula that links gene expression to prognostic outcomes in SOC. This transparency enhances the model's clinical utility and facilitates its integration into personalized medicine approaches.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a regression model, specifically designed for survival prediction. It calculates a cell death index (CDI) using a formula that incorporates the expression levels of 14 programmed cell death (PCD)-related genes. This CDI is then used to stratify patients into high and low CDI groups, which are associated with different survival outcomes. The model's performance was evaluated using time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, indicating its effectiveness in predicting survival probabilities over time. Additionally, the model was integrated into a nomogram that combines clinical parameters and the CDI to estimate 3-, 6-, and 9-year overall survival (OS), further demonstrating its regression capabilities.",

Data normalization and scaling were performed using standard parameters, and highly variable features were identified. Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted based on the 3000 highly variable genes, followed by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) dimensionality reduction analysis to visualize the dataset.\n\nWe also performed functional enrichment analysis of PCD-related differentially expressed genes using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses, along with Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA).

Based on these findings, we constructed a nomogram that included clinical parameters (age, stage, and grade) and the CDI to estimate 3-, 6-, and 9-year OS. Calibration curves and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate the accuracy and feasibility of the nomogram.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our model, we employed several performance metrics to comprehensively assess its predictive ability. We conducted a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis to evaluate the model's performance in distinguishing between different survival outcomes. This analysis was performed for multiple time points, including 3-, 5-, and 7-year survival, with additional details provided in supplementary materials.\n\nTo further validate the model's robustness, we compared its performance with other published signatures. This comparison demonstrated that our model exhibits a strong predictive ability and outperforms many existing biomarkers.\n\nWe also performed Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curve analysis to investigate the relationship between the CDI (Cell Death Index) and overall survival (OS) in patients.

The nomogram's accuracy and feasibility were evaluated using calibration curves, Decision Curve Analysis (DCA), and ROC analysis. These evaluations confirmed that the nomogram-predicted OS is consistent with the observed OS, indicating the model's practical utility in clinical settings.\n\nOverall, the set of performance metrics used in our study is representative of standard practices in the literature, ensuring a rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of our model's predictive capabilities.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "To evaluate the performance of our model, we conducted a comparison with other published signatures. This comparison demonstrated that our model exhibits robust predictive ability and outperforms many existing biomarkers. The evaluation was performed on benchmark datasets, including the TCGA-OV, GSE63885 + GSE26193, and GSE140082 cohorts. These datasets were chosen for their comprehensive clinical information and high sequencing quality, ensuring a rigorous assessment of our model's performance.\n\nIn addition to comparing with published signatures, we also considered simpler baselines. For instance, we performed univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses to clarify whether the CDI (Cell Death Index) is an independent prognostic indicator. The univariate analysis showed a significant association between the CDI and overall survival (OS) in patients with SOC (Serous Ovarian Cancer), with a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.07 and a p-value less than 0.05. Multivariate analysis, which accounted for other confounding factors, further confirmed the CDI as an independent prognostic predictor, with an HR of 89.71 and a p-value less than 0.05.\n\nThese comparisons and analyses collectively indicate that our model not only performs well against more complex, published methods but also stands out when evaluated against simpler baselines. The results underscore the importance of the CDI as a prognostic tool for SOC patients, suggesting its potential for clinical application.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our model's performance includes several key metrics that provide a comprehensive understanding of its predictive ability. We have employed univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses to assess the prognostic significance of the CDI. The univariate analysis indicated a significant association between the CDI and overall survival (OS) in patients with SOC, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.07 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 2.28\u20134.14, which is statistically significant (P < 0.05). The multivariate analysis further confirmed the CDI as an independent prognostic predictor, with an HR of 89.71 and a 95% CI of 36.12\u2013222.85, also statistically significant (P < 0.05).\n\nTo validate the robustness of our model, we compared it with other published signatures and biomarkers. The results demonstrated that our model outperforms many existing biomarkers, as shown in the supplementary materials. Additionally, we constructed a nomogram that includes clinical parameters such as age, stage, and grade, along with the CDI, to estimate 3-, 6-, and 9-year OS. The calibration curves revealed that the nomogram-predicted OS was consistent with the observed OS, indicating the model's reliability.\n\nWe also performed time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of the CDI. The ROC curves for 3-, 5-, and 7-year survival are presented, with detailed results available in the supplementary materials. Furthermore, decision curve analysis (DCA) was conducted to assess the clinical utility of the nomogram, providing additional evidence of its predictive value.\n\nThe statistical significance of our findings is supported by the P-values reported in the analyses. The use of confidence intervals for the hazard ratios and the consistent results across different cohorts (TCGA-OV, GSE63885 + GSE26193, and GSE140082) enhance the confidence in the model's performance. Overall, the evaluation metrics and statistical analyses provide strong evidence that our model is superior to existing biomarkers and baselines in predicting the survival of patients with SOC.",
