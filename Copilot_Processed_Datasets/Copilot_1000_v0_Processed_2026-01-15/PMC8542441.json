  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our research is the Weighted Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (WBOA). This algorithm is not entirely new, as it builds upon the existing Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (BOA), which is inspired by the behavior of butterflies in nature. The WBOA introduces a weighting mechanism to enhance the original BOA, aiming to improve its performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency.\n\nThe decision to use WBOA in this context, rather than publishing it in a machine-learning journal, is driven by the specific application focus of our study. Our primary goal is to develop an effective method for predicting COVID-19 parameters, rather than introducing a novel optimization algorithm. The WBOA is utilized as a means to achieve this goal, leveraging its strengths in feature selection to improve the classification accuracy of our model.\n\nThe WBOA is combined with an Intuitionistic Fuzzy Gaussian Function-based Adaptive-Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (IFGF-ANFIS) classifier. This combination allows for a robust and accurate prediction system, capable of handling the complexities and uncertainties associated with COVID-19 data. The WBOA helps in selecting the optimal features from the dataset, which are then used by the IFGF-ANFIS classifier to classify individuals based on their infection possibility.\n\nThe use of WBOA in this context demonstrates its practical applicability in real-world problems, particularly in the domain of healthcare and disease prediction. While the algorithm itself is not entirely novel, its application in this specific context and its integration with the IFGF-ANFIS classifier represent a significant contribution to the field.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model presented in this publication does not function as a meta-predictor. Instead, it employs a Weighted Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (WBOA) combined with an Intuitionistic Fuzzy Gaussian Function-based Adaptive-Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (IFGF-ANFIS) classifier. This approach is designed to assess COVID-19 based on symptoms and does not rely on data from other machine-learning algorithms as input.\n\nThe WBOA is utilized specifically for feature selection, ensuring that the most relevant features are chosen for the classification process. The IFGF-ANFIS classifier then processes these selected features to classify individuals based on their likelihood of having COVID-19. This method focuses on optimizing the classification performance by enhancing the feature selection process through the WBOA.\n\nThe training data used in this model is independent and specifically collected for the purpose of developing and validating the classifier. The dataset includes various parameters such as country visited, age, clinical manifestations, other signs and symptoms, severity of the disease, and contact history with COVID-19 positive patients. These parameters are normalized using z-score normalization to ensure consistency and improve the model's performance.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our research, data encoding and preprocessing were crucial steps to ensure the effectiveness of our machine-learning algorithm. The dataset was collected from a reliable source, and it included various parameters that influence the presence of COVID-19 in individuals. These parameters encompassed travel history, age, clinical manifestations, other signs and symptoms, severity of the disease, and contact with COVID-19 positive patients.\n\nTo prepare the data for analysis, we employed z-score normalization, a commonly used technique for data normalization. This method scales the data to fit within a specific range, typically between -1.0 and 1.0, or 0.0 and 1.0. Z-score normalization standardizes the data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of each attribute. The formula used for normalization is:\n\nd' = (d - mean(p)) / std(p)\n\nwhere d' is the normalized value, d is the original value, mean(p) is the mean of the attribute values, and std(p) is the standard deviation of the attribute values.\n\nThis normalization process is essential for ensuring that all features contribute equally to the model's performance, preventing any single feature from dominating due to its scale. By standardizing the data, we enhanced the convergence speed and stability of the optimization algorithm, leading to more accurate and reliable predictions.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our proposed methodology, the model utilizes a set of parameters to assess the presence of COVID-19 based on symptoms. The parameters considered are:\n\n1. Country: Recent travel history to different countries.\n2. Age: Classification according to WHO age group criteria.\n3. Clinical manifestations: Major signs and symptoms of COVID-19, including fever, general malaise, shortness of breath, dry cough, and throat infection.\n4. Other signs and symptoms: Additional indicators such as chest pain, nasal congestion, and diarrhea.\n5. Severity: Categorization of the disease severity as mild, moderate, or severe.\n6. Contact: Past contact with a COVID-19 positive patient.\n\nThese parameters were selected based on their relevance to COVID-19 symptoms and their potential to influence the presence of the disease in an individual. The dataset used for this study was collected from Kaggle, ensuring a comprehensive and diverse set of data points for analysis. The selection of these parameters aims to provide a robust framework for predicting COVID-19 prevalence and the initial phases of infection.",
  "optimization/features": "In the proposed methodology, the dataset used for COVID-19 prediction includes several input features. These features are collected from a publicly available dataset and include parameters such as the countries visited by the individual, age classification according to WHO criteria, major clinical manifestations like fever, general malaise, shortness of breath, dry cough, and throat infection, other signs and symptoms like chest pain, nasal congestion, and diarrhea, the severity of the disease, and past contact with a COVID-19 positive patient.\n\nFeature selection is performed using the Weighted Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (WBOA). This algorithm is utilized to select the optimal attributes from the dataset, enhancing the precision of the prediction model. The feature selection process is conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data.\n\nThe specific number of features used as input is not explicitly stated, but the process involves selecting the most relevant features from the dataset to improve the model's performance. The features are normalized using z-score normalization before being fed into the classification model. This normalization technique scales the data to fit within a specific range, typically between -1.0 to 1.0 or 0.0 to 1.0, based on the mean and standard deviation of the attribute values.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The proposed methodology employs a Weighted Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (WBOA) combined with an Intuitionistic Fuzzy Gaussian Function-based Adaptive-Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (IFGF-ANFIS) classifier. This approach is designed to handle the complexity of COVID-19 prediction by effectively managing the number of parameters relative to the training data.\n\nThe dataset used for this study includes various parameters such as age, sex, travel history, clinical manifestations, and severity of symptoms. These parameters are carefully selected to ensure that the model captures the essential features of COVID-19 without overcomplicating the fitting process. The use of WBOA for feature selection helps in identifying the most relevant features, thereby reducing the dimensionality of the data and preventing overfitting.\n\nTo address the potential issue of overfitting, the dataset is normalized using z-score normalization. This technique scales the data to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, which helps in standardizing the range of features and improving the model's generalization capability. Additionally, the WBOA ensures that only the most significant features are selected, further mitigating the risk of overfitting.\n\nUnderfitting is avoided by employing a robust classification algorithm, the IFGF-ANFIS classifier. This classifier is capable of capturing complex relationships in the data due to its fuzzy logic and neural network components. The combination of these techniques allows the model to learn from the data effectively, even with a moderate number of training points.\n\nThe performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure. These metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of the model's ability to predict COVID-19 cases accurately. The results indicate that the proposed methodology outperforms other machine learning algorithms in terms of these metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling the complexity of the data without overfitting or underfitting.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed a Weighted Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (WBOA) to enhance the precision of our COVID-19 prediction model. This algorithm plays a crucial role in selecting optimal attributes from the dataset, which helps in preventing overfitting. By focusing on the most relevant features, WBOA ensures that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data, rather than merely memorizing the training data.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized Z-score normalization as a preprocessing step. This technique standardizes the features by transforming them to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Normalization helps in stabilizing the gradients during the training process, making the model more robust and less prone to overfitting.\n\nThe combination of feature selection through WBOA and data normalization through Z-score ensures that our model remains efficient and effective, minimizing the risk of overfitting and improving its overall performance.",

It is designed to be interpretable, leveraging the structure of an Adaptive-Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) combined with Intuitionistic Fuzzy Gaussian functions. This approach allows for a clear understanding of how inputs are processed and how outputs are generated.\n\nThe model consists of several layers, each performing specific operations that contribute to the final prediction. In the second layer, fuzzy operators and an AND operator are used to fuzzify the inputs, producing firing strengths of the rules. These firing strengths are then normalized in the third layer, providing a clear indication of the relative importance of each rule. The fourth layer adapts the normalized weights using a first-order polynomial, making the relationship between inputs and outputs more explicit. Finally, the fifth layer summarizes all incoming signals to produce the final output, which in this case is the COVID-19 probability prediction.\n\nThe use of fuzzy logic and Gaussian functions adds transparency by allowing the model to handle uncertainty and provide degrees of membership and non-membership for each input. This makes it easier to interpret how different symptoms or features contribute to the prediction of COVID-19 probability. Additionally, the Weighted Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (WBOA) is used to select optimal attributes, further enhancing the model's interpretability by focusing on the most relevant features.\n\nOverall, the model's structure and the use of fuzzy logic and optimization algorithms make it transparent and interpretable, providing clear insights into the decision-making process.",
