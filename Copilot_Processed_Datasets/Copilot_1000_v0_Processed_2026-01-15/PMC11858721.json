  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset utilized in this study was primarily obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), a comprehensive and publicly accessible repository of cancer genomic data. Additionally, six independent validation cohorts were sourced from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), specifically the datasets GSE13213, GSE26939, GSE29016, GSE30219, GSE31210, and GSE42127. These datasets provided a robust foundation for our analyses, ensuring the reliability and generalizability of our findings.\n\nThe RNA sequencing profiles and clinical data from TCGA were supplemented with the GEO datasets to enhance the breadth and depth of our study. The raw expression counts were normalized to transcripts per million (TPM) to standardize the data across different samples.

  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets used in this study were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and supplemented by six independent validation cohorts from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The datasets were split into a training set and multiple independent validation sets to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the developed model.\n\nThe training set consisted of data from the TCGA database, which included RNA sequencing profiles and clinical data. This dataset was used to develop the PANoptosis-related optimal model (PROM) through a systematic machine learning approach. The validation cohorts, which included GSE13213, GSE26939, GSE29016, GSE30219, GSE31210, and GSE42127, were used to assess the predictive performance of the model.

Additionally, data quality was assessed through principal component analysis (PCA) and sample-wise correlation analysis to identify and remove potential technical outliers.\n\nThe distribution of the datasets used in this study is comparable to previously published machine learning datasets in the field of cancer research. The use of multiple independent validation cohorts is a standard practice to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the developed models. The integration of comprehensive bioinformatics analyses and machine learning algorithms allowed for the construction of a robust, accurate, and clinically applicable prognostic prediction tool for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).",
  "dataset/availability": "The complete set of data utilized in this investigation can be obtained from two primary repositories: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which is accessible via http://cancergenome.nih.gov/, and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/. These publicly available databases house all the relevant datasets employed throughout our study. The data is available for use by the scientific community, allowing for reproducibility and further research. The datasets include RNA sequencing profiles and clinical data, which were obtained from TCGA and supplemented by six independent validation cohorts from GEO.

The normalized data was assessed through principal component analysis (PCA) to ensure data quality. The data availability ensures that other researchers can access and validate the findings, promoting transparency and collaboration in the scientific community.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in our study is ensemble learning, specifically combining multiple algorithms to enhance predictive performance. The algorithms employed include Lasso regression and stepwise Cox regression, among others. This approach leverages the strengths of different models to create a robust prognostic tool.\n\nThe algorithm used is not entirely new, as it builds upon established machine learning techniques. However, the specific combination and application of these algorithms in the context of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and PANoptosis is novel. The integration of Lasso regression for feature selection and stepwise Cox regression for time-to-event modeling is a unique approach tailored to our research objectives.\n\nThe reason this algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that the focus of our study is on its application in medical research, particularly in the field of oncology. The primary goal is to develop a prognostic model for LUAD, rather than to introduce a new machine-learning algorithm. The innovation lies in the application and validation of these algorithms in a clinical context, demonstrating their utility in improving patient outcomes.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model developed in this study is indeed a meta-predictor, leveraging the strengths of multiple machine learning algorithms to enhance its prognostic capabilities. The meta-predictor integrates an ensemble of 10 different machine learning algorithms, each contributing unique insights and predictive power.\n\nThe optimal model identified through this comprehensive comparison is a combination of Lasso regression and stepwise Cox regression. Lasso regression is utilized for feature selection, helping to identify the most relevant prognostic markers from the dataset. Stepwise Cox regression, on the other hand, is employed for time-to-event modeling, which is crucial for predicting patient survival outcomes.\n\nThe training data used for developing the meta-predictor is derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, supplemented by six independent validation cohorts from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). This ensures that the training data is independent and diverse, encompassing a wide range of patient samples and clinical variables. Batch effects were mitigated using the ComBat algorithm, with TCGA data serving as the reference batch, further ensuring the independence and consistency of the training data.\n\nThe use of multiple machine learning algorithms in a meta-predictor framework allows for a more robust and accurate prognostic tool. By combining the strengths of different algorithms, the model can capture complex patterns and interactions within the data, leading to improved predictive performance. The consistent validation across multiple independent cohorts further supports the reliability and generalizability of the meta-predictor.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure the data was suitable for analysis. Initially, RNA sequencing profiles and clinical data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, supplemented by six independent validation cohorts from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The raw expression counts were normalized to transcripts per million (TPM) using a specific formula to account for gene length and total counts. Batch effects were mitigated using the ComBat algorithm, with TCGA data serving as the reference batch and adjusting for covariates such as age, gender, and tumor stage. The normalized data underwent a log2 transformation to enhance normality. Data quality was assessed through principal component analysis (PCA), and sample-wise correlation analysis was performed to identify and remove potential technical outliers. This preprocessing ensured that the data was consistent and ready for further analysis using machine learning algorithms.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized an ensemble of 10 machine learning algorithms to construct the PANoptosis-Related Optimal Model (PROM). The model incorporates a comprehensive set of 89 PANoptosis-related genes, which were identified through a combination of single-cell transcriptomic profiling, differential expression analysis, and univariate Cox proportional hazards regression. These genes were selected based on their prognostic significance and differential expression between tumor and normal tissues.\n\nThe selection of these 89 genes was driven by their association with key biological processes and pathways relevant to lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), such as metabolic processes, vesicular and secretory granule functions, enzymatic activities, and binding functionalities. These genes were further validated through extensive multiomics analyses, which revealed significant alterations in critical oncogenic pathways and immune landscape between PROM-stratified subgroups.\n\nThe final model, which emerged as the superior predictive framework, is a hybrid approach that leverages the feature selection capabilities of Lasso regression with the time-to-event modeling of stepwise Cox regression. This combination demonstrated the highest concordance index (C-index) of 0.698, indicating robust prognostic performance. The model's parameters were optimized through comprehensive model comparison and cross-validation across seven independent LUAD cohorts, ensuring its reliability and consistency across diverse patient populations.",
  "optimization/features": "In the development of the PANoptosis-related optimal model (PROM), a comprehensive approach was taken to identify and select relevant features for input. Initially, a set of 89 genes with potential implications in cancer prognosis was identified through differential expression analysis and Cox proportional hazards analysis. These genes were selected based on their differential expression between tumor and normal tissues and their prognostic significance.\n\nFeature selection was performed using a combination of methods to ensure robustness and relevance. Univariate Cox regression was employed as an initial step, requiring a minimum expression threshold to filter out genes with low expression levels. This step was conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the feature selection process did not introduce bias from the validation or test sets.\n\nSubsequently, an ensemble of 10 machine learning algorithms was utilized to evaluate and compare model performance. The Lasso + Stepcox combination emerged as the superior model, demonstrating the highest concordance index (C-index) of 0.698. This hybrid approach leverages the feature selection capabilities of Lasso regression, which penalizes the absolute size of the regression coefficients, with the time-to-event modeling of stepwise Cox regression. This combination ensures that the selected features are not only statistically significant but also clinically relevant.\n\nThe final model, PROM, was developed using the selected features, which were validated through extensive cross-validation across seven independent cohorts. This rigorous process ensures that the input features are robust and generalizable, providing a reliable prognostic tool for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study involved a comprehensive machine learning approach to develop the PANoptosis-Related Optimal Model (PROM). The model was constructed using an ensemble of 10 different machine learning algorithms, which were evaluated through tenfold cross-validation with 100 iterations. This rigorous process ensured that the model's performance was robust and generalizable.\n\nThe number of parameters in the model was indeed larger than the number of training points, which is a common scenario in high-dimensional genomic data. To address the risk of overfitting, several strategies were implemented. First, feature selection was performed using univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, which helped in identifying the most relevant genes associated with prognosis. This step reduced the dimensionality of the data and focused on the most informative features.\n\nAdditionally, the Lasso regression technique was used, which inherently performs feature selection by penalizing the absolute size of the regression coefficients. This method helps in reducing the complexity of the model and prevents overfitting by shrinking some of the coefficients to zero.\n\nTo further validate the model and rule out overfitting, extensive cross-validation was conducted across seven independent LUAD cohorts. The model's performance was evaluated using the concordance index (C-index) and time-dependent area under the curve (AUC) metrics. The consistent performance across multiple validation cohorts indicated that the model was not overfitted to the training data.\n\nConversely, underfitting was addressed by using an ensemble of machine learning algorithms. Each algorithm has its strengths and weaknesses, and by combining them, the model could capture a broader range of patterns in the data. The Lasso + Stepcox combination, in particular, demonstrated superior performance, leveraging the feature selection capabilities of Lasso regression with the time-to-event modeling of stepwise Cox regression. This hybrid approach ensured that the model was complex enough to capture the underlying relationships in the data without being too simplistic.\n\nIn summary, the fitting method involved a careful balance between model complexity and generalization. Feature selection, regularization techniques, and extensive cross-validation were employed to mitigate the risks of both overfitting and underfitting, resulting in a robust and reliable prognostic tool for LUAD.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and enhance the robustness of our prognostic model. One of the key methods used was Lasso regression, which is particularly effective in feature selection by imposing an L1 penalty on the coefficients, thereby driving some of them to zero. This helps in selecting a subset of the most relevant genes, reducing the complexity of the model and mitigating overfitting.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized the Stepwise Cox regression method, which iteratively adds or removes variables based on statistical criteria, ensuring that only the most significant predictors are retained in the final model. This approach further refines the model by eliminating less informative features, thereby improving its generalizability.\n\nMoreover, we integrated an ensemble of machine learning algorithms, including ridge regression, elastic net, and survival support vector machines, each with its own regularization properties. Ridge regression, for instance, applies an L2 penalty, which helps in shrinking the coefficients but does not set them to zero, thus providing a different form of regularization. Elastic net combines both L1 and L2 penalties, offering a balanced approach to feature selection and coefficient shrinkage.\n\nThese regularization techniques collectively ensured that our PANoptosis-related optimal model (PROM) was robust, accurate, and less prone to overfitting, thereby enhancing its prognostic capability across multiple validation cohorts.",
  "optimization/config": "Not applicable.",
  "model/interpretability": "The PANoptosis-Related Optimal Model (PROM) is designed to be interpretable, providing insights into the underlying biological mechanisms that drive its prognostic capabilities. Unlike many black-box models, PROM leverages a combination of single-cell transcriptomic profiling and machine learning algorithms to identify critical PANoptosis-associated gene signatures. This approach allows for a transparent understanding of how specific genes and their interactions contribute to the model's predictions.\n\nOne of the key features of PROM is its ability to stratify patients into high- and low-risk groups based on gene expression profiles. This stratification is not arbitrary but is grounded in the biological relevance of the genes involved. For instance, the model's constituent genes, when analyzed through principal component analysis (PCA), consistently separate patients into distinct clusters across multiple datasets. This clear separation indicates that the model captures fundamental differences in tumor biology that are directly linked to patient outcomes.\n\nFurthermore, the model's performance is evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses, which demonstrate exceptional predictive accuracy with area under the curve (AUC) values exceeding 0.7 in all validation cohorts. This high level of accuracy is not just a statistical artifact but is supported by the biological significance of the genes and pathways identified by PROM.\n\nThe model also provides insights into the tumor immune microenvironment. For example, patients with low PROM scores tend to have higher immune cell infiltration and more favorable immune environments, as indicated by the Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) analysis and the Estimation of STromal and Immune cells in MAlignant Tumor tissues using Expression data (ESTIMATE) algorithm. This information is crucial for understanding how the model's predictions can be translated into clinical decisions, such as the selection of immunotherapy treatments.\n\nIn summary, PROM is not a black-box model but a transparent tool that offers clear examples of how gene expression patterns and immune dynamics influence lung adenocarcinoma prognosis. This interpretability is a strength of the model, as it allows clinicians and researchers to understand the biological basis of the predictions and to develop targeted therapeutic interventions.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is primarily a classification model. It is designed to stratify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups based on their survival probabilities. The model's performance is evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves, which assess the survival differences between these risk groups. Additionally, the model's predictive capability is quantified using the area under the curve (AUC) values from receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses at different time points (1 year, 3 years, and 5 years). These metrics are indicative of a classification model aimed at predicting binary outcomes (high-risk vs. low-risk) rather than continuous values, which would be characteristic of a regression model.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the method involved a comprehensive approach to ensure its robustness and reliability. Initially, ten machine learning algorithms were assessed through tenfold cross-validation with 100 iterations. This process helped in identifying the most effective algorithms for the task. The performance of these models was evaluated using metrics such as Harrell\u2019s C-index and time-dependent area under the curve (AUC). Additionally, calibration plots were used to assess the models' predictive accuracy.\n\nTo further validate the method, extensive cross-validation was conducted across seven independent cohorts. This step was crucial in demonstrating the model's generalizability and consistency across different datasets. The model's ability to stratify patients into high- and low-risk groups was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests, which showed significant prognostic discriminative ability.\n\nThe method's reliability was also evaluated through principal component analysis (PCA) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. These analyses provided compelling evidence of the model's ability to capture key biological features that differentiate between high- and low-risk tumors. The clear stratification observed in PCA indicated that the model effectively identifies critical biological characteristics associated with prognosis.\n\nMoreover, the method's potential as a biomarker for predicting immunotherapy response and guiding treatment decisions was explored. The negative correlation between the model scores and immune infiltration, along with differences in TIDE and TCIA scores, suggested its utility in predicting responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors. The strong correlation between the model scores and cell cycle-related pathways indicated that targeting these processes could be particularly effective in high-risk tumors.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation method involved a rigorous process of cross-validation, independent dataset testing, and biological validation. This comprehensive approach ensured that the method is robust, reliable, and has the potential to significantly advance personalized medicine for lung adenocarcinoma.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our prognostic risk model (PROM), we employed several performance metrics to ensure a comprehensive assessment of its predictive accuracy and robustness. The primary metric reported is the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which was calculated at 1, 3, and 5 years. This metric provides a time-dependent measure of the model's ability to discriminate between high-risk and low-risk patients. The AUC values across various cohorts consistently exceeded 0.7, with several cohorts achieving AUCs above 0.8, indicating excellent discriminative ability.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized Kaplan-Meier survival curves to visually assess the model's predictive performance. These curves demonstrated the model's consistent ability to differentiate patients into high- and low-risk groups, with the high-risk group invariably exhibiting significantly poorer prognosis across all validation cohorts. The log-rank test was used to validate the statistical significance of these survival differences, with p-values consistently below 0.05.\n\nTo further evaluate the model's stability and reliability, we conducted 1000 bootstrap iterations. This approach allowed us to assess the model's performance under various conditions and ensured that our findings were not due to random chance. The results of these iterations supported the model's robustness and consistency across diverse patient populations.\n\nMoreover, we performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using the expression profiles of the model's constituent genes. PCA revealed a clear separation of patients into two distinct clusters based on gene expression patterns, providing strong evidence for the biological relevance of the PROM signature. This separation correlated with patient outcomes, further validating the model's prognostic capabilities.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics reported in our study are representative of current standards in the literature. The use of AUC, Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank tests, bootstrap iterations, and PCA provides a thorough evaluation of the model's predictive accuracy, robustness, and biological relevance. These metrics collectively demonstrate the model's consistency and reliability across diverse patient populations.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we did not perform a direct comparison to publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. However, we did evaluate the performance of our prognostic risk model (PROM) across multiple lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) datasets, including GSE13213, GSE26939, GSE29016, GSE30219, GSE31210, and GSE42127. The predictive performance of our best model was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves, which showed that high-risk samples exhibited poorer survival rates across these datasets.\n\nRegarding simpler baselines, our approach involved evaluating ten different machine learning algorithms through tenfold cross-validation with 100 iterations. This process allowed us to compare the performance of various algorithms and select the most robust one for our prognostic model. The algorithms included stepwise Cox regression, Lasso, ridge regression, partial least squares regression for Cox models (plsRcox), CoxBoost, random survival forest, gradient boosting machine, elastic net, SuperPC, and survival-support vector machine (SVM). Model performance was assessed using Harrell\u2019s C-index, time-dependent area under the curve (AUC), and calibration plots, providing a comprehensive evaluation against these baselines.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "In our study, we employed rigorous statistical methods to ensure the robustness and significance of our findings. For the predictive performance of our model, we utilized receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses, which demonstrated exceptional predictive accuracy with area under the curve (AUC) values exceeding 0.7 in all validation cohorts. Notably, in several cohorts, the AUC surpassed 0.8, indicating excellent discriminative ability. These results highlight the model\u2019s consistency and reliability across diverse patient populations.\n\nTo assess the statistical significance of our results, we applied the log-rank test for survival analysis, which showed significant differences in prognosis between high- and low-risk groups across all validation cohorts (p < 0.05). Additionally, we used the Benjamini-Hochberg method for multiple testing corrections in our functional and pathway enrichment analyses, ensuring that our findings were statistically significant (adjusted p < 0.05).\n\nFor the immune microenvironment profiling, we integrated multiple computational approaches, including The Cancer Immunome Atlas (TCIA) methodology and the Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) algorithm. These methods provided robust estimates of immunophenotype scores and predicted responses to immune checkpoint blockade, respectively. The TIMER 2.0 database was used to quantify immune cell infiltration, further supporting the biological relevance of our findings.\n\nIn our chemotherapy response prediction, we employed the pRRophetic package with the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer 2 (GDSC2) database as a reference. We used ridge regression with tenfold cross-validation to predict half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values, ensuring the accuracy of our drug sensitivity predictions. The prediction accuracy was assessed through root mean squared error (RMSE) and Pearson correlation between predicted and observed IC50 values.\n\nOverall, our study incorporates comprehensive statistical analyses and validation methods to ensure the confidence and reliability of our results. The use of multiple testing corrections, robust statistical tests, and cross-validation techniques underscores the significance and generalizability of our findings.",
