  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study originates from the Proyecto Epidemiologico Guanacaste, a longitudinal cohort study conducted in Guanacaste, Costa Rica, between 1993 and 2001. This study focused on human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, other screening tests, and the risk of cervical precancer and cancer.\n\nThe total number of women included in the analysis was 9,406. Among these, there were 279 cases of CIN2+ (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse) and 9,127 controls with less than CIN2. The training set consisted of 189 randomly selected cases and 555 randomly selected controls. The validation set included 90 CIN2+ cases not in the training set and did not include eight cancer upgrades after the random draw. The screening set included only enrollment images, with five cases not having enrollment images available. Additionally, 378 controls were not used due to the lack of an enrollment image.\n\nThe training set comprised one image per woman, totaling 744 images (189 cases and 555 controls). The screening set used the enrollment image for women, totaling 8,259 images (85 cases and 8,174 controls). The validation and screening set control pool consisted of 8,194 controls. The validation set used the last image during follow-up, totaling 242 images. The screening set used the enrollment image, noting that 20 validation set controls did not have an enrollment image. The validation set included one image per woman, totaling 324 images (82 cases and 242 controls).\n\nThe cohort initially enrolled 10,080 women, but 674 were excluded due to various reasons, including no image collected (630 women), multiple colposcopy sessions (31 women), and inadequate histology (13 women). The dataset includes cervigram images, which are photographs of the cervix taken during a colposcopy examination. These images were used to train and validate an automated visual evaluation algorithm designed to detect cervical precancer and cancer. The algorithm was trained using a subset of these images and validated using a separate subset to ensure its accuracy and reliability.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into three main splits: training, validation, and screening sets. The training set consisted of 744 images, with 189 cases and 555 controls. This set was created by randomly selecting one image per woman. The validation set included 324 images, comprising 82 cases and 242 controls. This set used the last image during follow-up for each woman. The screening set was the largest, containing 8,259 images, with 85 cases and 8,174 controls. This set used the enrollment image for each woman, noting that 20 validation set controls did not have an enrollment image.\n\nAdditionally, there were 90 CIN2+ cases not included in the training set. The validation set did not include eight cancer upgrades after the random draw. The screening set initially included only enrollment images, but five cases did not have enrollment images available. Furthermore, 378 controls were not used due to the lack of an enrollment image.\n\nThe total number of women included in the analysis was 9,406, with 279 CIN2+ cases and 9,127 controls. The dataset was derived from the Proyecto Epidemiologico Guanacaste, a longitudinal cohort study focused on human papillomavirus infection, other screening tests, and the risk of cervical precancer/cancer. The main analysis concentrated on images from cohort enrollment, examining how automated image analysis of enrollment screening images performed in predicting cases found over the course of the entire cohort study.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset used in this study was derived from the Proyecto Epidemiologico Guanacaste, a longitudinal cohort study focused on human papillomavirus infection and cervical precancer/cancer. The dataset included 9,406 women, with 279 cases of CIN2+ and 9,127 controls with less than CIN2.\n\nThe dataset was split into training, validation, and screening sets. For the training set, approximately 70% of the cases (189 out of 279) and a frequency-matched set of controls (555 out of 9,127) were randomly selected. The validation set included the remaining 30% of cases (90 out of 279) and additional controls, ensuring that the validation set did not include eight cancer upgrades after the random draw. The screening set consisted of enrollment images from women not included in the training or validation sets, totaling 8,259 images (85 cases and 8,174 controls).\n\nTo ensure independence between the training and test sets, the validation and screening sets were constructed from images taken at cohort enrollment visits, excluding all images from women in the training set. This approach prevented any overlap between the training and validation/test datasets, maintaining the independence necessary for robust model evaluation.\n\nThe distribution of the dataset differs from some previously published machine learning datasets in that it focuses on a specific medical condition (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) and uses a longitudinal cohort study design. This design allows for a more comprehensive analysis of the progression of the disease over time, as well as the evaluation of the model's performance in a real-world screening scenario. The use of frequency-matched controls and the exclusion of training set images from the validation and screening sets are key aspects that enhance the reliability and generalizability of the findings.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data used in this study is not publicly available. The dataset originates from the Proyecto Epidemiologico Guanacaste, a longitudinal cohort study conducted in Guanacaste, Costa Rica, focusing on human papillomavirus infection, screening tests, and the risk of cervical precancer/cancer. The study included 9,406 women, with 279 cases of CIN2+ and 9,127 controls. The dataset was split into training, validation, and screening sets, with specific criteria for inclusion and exclusion.\n\nThe training set consisted of 744 images, including 189 cases and 555 controls, with one image per woman. The validation set included 324 images, comprising 82 cases and 242 controls, also with one image per woman. The screening set used enrollment images for 8,259 women, including 85 cases and 8,174 controls.\n\nThe data augmentation techniques, such as rotation, mirroring, sheering, and gamma transformation, were applied to artificially increase the number of cervical images. The faster R-CNN end-to-end training configuration of stochastic gradient descent optimization was used for training the model.\n\nThe dataset was not released in a public forum due to privacy and ethical considerations. The study adhered to strict protocols to ensure the confidentiality and security of the participants' data. The data was used solely for the purposes of this research, and access was restricted to the research team and authorized collaborators. The National Library of Medicine collaborators independently checked the technique, but they did not have access to the raw data. Instead, they evaluated different subsets of the Guanacaste cohort images for model training and tested the trained network with altered test images.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used is Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), specifically the Faster R-CNN architecture. This algorithm is not entirely new, as it has been previously developed and used in various computer vision tasks. The choice of Faster R-CNN was driven by its proven combination of speed and accuracy in object detection tasks, which is crucial for the automated visual evaluation of cervical images.\n\nThe decision to use an established algorithm like Faster R-CNN, rather than developing a novel one, was strategic. The primary focus of the study was on the application of deep learning techniques to cervical cancer screening, rather than the innovation of new machine-learning algorithms. By leveraging a well-established architecture, the research could concentrate on the specific challenges and nuances of cervical image analysis, such as handling imbalanced datasets and enhancing model performance through techniques like transfer learning and data augmentation.\n\nThe Faster R-CNN algorithm was chosen for its ability to perform object detection, feature extraction, and classification efficiently. This makes it well-suited for the task of locating the cervix within an image and predicting the probability of CIN2+ cases. The algorithm's end-to-end training configuration with stochastic gradient descent optimization further ensured robust performance.\n\nIn summary, while the Faster R-CNN algorithm is not new, its application to cervical image analysis represents a significant contribution to the field of medical imaging and cancer screening. The focus on practical implementation and validation within a specific medical context justifies the use of an established algorithm, rather than the development of a novel one.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model described does not function as a meta-predictor. It is a standalone automated visual evaluation algorithm designed to detect cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2+) using cervigram images. The algorithm is based on the Faster R-CNN architecture, which performs object detection, feature extraction, and classification to predict the probability of CIN2+ cases.\n\nThe training process involved using cervigram images, cervix location annotations, and class ground truths (case of CIN2+ or control <CIN2). To enhance the model's performance, transfer learning was employed by initializing the CNN architecture with pretrained weights from a model trained on the ImageNet dataset. Additionally, data augmentation techniques such as rotation, mirroring, sheering, and gamma transformation were applied to artificially increase the number of cervical images.\n\nThe algorithm's performance was evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the curve (AUC). The model's predictions were found to be highly reproducible, with a Pearson correlation of 0.97 within pairs of replicate images.\n\nThe model's predictions are primarily based on the region surrounding the os and perform best when the cervix is oriented directly towards the camera. The algorithm is designed to focus on regions with visible texture rather than smooth areas, and it generally ignores glare or other distractors, although non-cervix objects can sometimes influence its predictions.\n\nThe model was trained and validated using images from the Proyecto Epidemiologico Guanacaste cohort, a longitudinal study of human papillomavirus infection and cervical precancer/cancer. The training set consisted of randomly selected cases and controls, while the validation set included images from cohort enrollment visits. The model's performance was compared with baseline screening tests such as cervicography, cytology, and HPV testing.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding process involved preparing cervigram images for the machine-learning algorithm. Initially, three controls per case were selected from women who did not present with CIN2+ during active surveillance, frequency-matched to the time of diagnosis of the case. A random, approximately 70% of cases and frequency-matched controls were chosen for training, with the remaining approximately 30% reserved as the initial validation test set. A single image was randomly chosen from each pair of images available per prediagnostic case visit and control visit.\n\nThe system architecture utilized Faster R-CNN, which performs object detection, feature extraction, and classification. The inputs to train the model were the cervigram images, cervix location (a rectangle encompassing the cervix), and the class ground truth (case of CIN2+ or control <CIN2). To create the cervix locator function, an independent cervix locator algorithm using Faster R-CNN was trained to separate the cervix from the background. This involved annotating 2000 images by manually drawing a rectangle around the cervix.\n\nTo compensate for the limited dataset, transfer learning was employed by initializing the CNN architecture with pretrained weights from a model trained with the ImageNet dataset. The model was then retrained with the cervigram images in the training set. Additionally, image data augmentation was performed, artificially increasing the number of cervical images by applying minor distortions such as rotation, mirroring, sheering, and gamma transformation. The faster R-CNN end-to-end training configuration of stochastic gradient descent optimization was used with specific parameters.",
  "optimization/parameters": "The model utilized for the automated visual evaluation algorithm is based on the Faster R-CNN architecture. This architecture is known for its efficiency in object detection tasks, which in this case involves detecting the cervix within the input image and predicting the probability of CIN2+.\n\nThe specific number of parameters (p) in the model is not explicitly stated, but it is important to note that Faster R-CNN is a deep learning model that typically involves a large number of parameters due to its convolutional neural network (CNN) layers. The exact number of parameters can vary depending on the specific configuration and the pretrained weights used for transfer learning.\n\nThe selection of parameters was guided by the use of transfer learning, where the CNN architecture was initialized with pretrained weights from a model trained on the ImageNet dataset. This approach leverages the knowledge gained from a large and diverse dataset to improve the performance of the model on the specific task of cervical image analysis. Additionally, image augmentation techniques such as rotation, mirroring, sheering, and gamma transformation were employed to artificially increase the number of training samples and enhance the robustness of the model.\n\nThe optimization process involved stochastic gradient descent, which is a common method for training deep learning models. The parameters for this optimization were likely chosen based on standard practices and possibly fine-tuned through experimentation to achieve the best performance on the validation set. The specific parameters used for the stochastic gradient descent optimization are detailed in Supplementary Table 2, which is available online.",
  "optimization/features": "The input features for the automated visual evaluation algorithm consist of cervigram images, cervix location annotations, and class ground truth labels indicating whether the image represents a case of CIN2+ or a control (<CIN2). The cervix location is defined by a rectangle encompassing the cervix, which is manually annotated. The class ground truth is binary, indicating the presence or absence of CIN2+.\n\nFeature selection in the traditional sense was not performed, as the primary features are the raw image pixels and the annotated cervix locations. However, the algorithm inherently performs feature extraction through the convolutional neural network (CNN) layers, which learn to identify relevant features from the input images.\n\nThe process of annotating the cervix locations involved manually drawing rectangles around the cervix in 2000 images. This annotation step was crucial for training the cervix locator function, which is a part of the automated visual evaluation algorithm. The locator function was trained independently using these annotated images, ensuring that the final model could accurately identify the cervix in new, unseen images.\n\nThe training set was used exclusively for this annotation and training process, ensuring that the feature extraction and selection were done using the training data only. This approach helps to prevent data leakage and ensures that the model's performance on the validation and screening sets is a true reflection of its generalizability.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The automated visual evaluation algorithm employed a deep learning approach using Faster R-CNN, which inherently involves a large number of parameters. The number of parameters in such models is typically much larger than the number of training points, especially when dealing with high-resolution images. To address potential overfitting, several techniques were utilized.\n\nFirstly, transfer learning was employed by initializing the convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with pretrained weights from a model trained on the ImageNet dataset. This approach leverages the features learned from a vast and diverse dataset, providing a robust starting point for the model.\n\nSecondly, data augmentation was performed to artificially increase the number of training samples. This involved applying minor distortions to the original images, such as rotation, mirroring, sheering, and gamma transformation. These augmentations help the model generalize better by exposing it to a wider variety of image variations.\n\nAdditionally, the model's performance was validated on a separate validation set that was not used during training. This ensures that the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data is assessed independently.\n\nTo further mitigate overfitting, stochastic gradient descent optimization was used with carefully selected parameters. This optimization technique helps in finding a good set of weights that minimize the loss function without overfitting to the training data.\n\nUnderfitting was addressed by ensuring that the model had sufficient capacity to learn the complex patterns in the data. The use of a deep neural network with multiple layers allowed the model to capture intricate features in the cervical images. The extensive training process, combined with the use of a large and diverse dataset, helped in achieving a model that could accurately predict the probability of CIN2+ cases.\n\nOverall, the combination of transfer learning, data augmentation, and rigorous validation procedures ensured that the model was neither overfitted nor underfitted, providing reliable and accurate predictions.",
  "optimization/regularization": "To prevent overfitting, several techniques were employed during the training of our automated visual evaluation algorithm. One key method was data augmentation, which involved artificially increasing the number of cervical images by applying minor distortions to the original images. These distortions included rotation, mirroring, sheering, and gamma transformation. This process helped to create a more diverse training set, making the model more robust and less likely to overfit to the specific details of the original images.\n\nAdditionally, transfer learning was utilized. The convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was initialized with pretrained weights from a model trained on the ImageNet dataset, which contains millions of images of various natural objects. This approach allowed the model to leverage features learned from a large and diverse dataset, further reducing the risk of overfitting to the smaller, specific dataset of cervigram images.\n\nThe use of stochastic gradient descent optimization with the faster R-CNN end-to-end training configuration also contributed to the regularization of the model. This optimization method, combined with the parameters specified in the supplementary table, helped to ensure that the model generalized well to unseen data.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization schedule used in our study are detailed in the supplementary materials. Specifically, the parameters for the stochastic gradient descent optimization are provided in Supplementary Table 2. This table includes all the necessary details for replicating the training process, such as learning rates, momentum, and other relevant hyper-parameters.\n\nThe model files, including the pretrained weights from the ImageNet dataset and the final trained weights for the Faster R-CNN architecture, are not directly available in the main publication. However, the methods and techniques used for training, including data augmentation and transfer learning, are thoroughly described in the supplementary methods. This information allows other researchers to implement similar models using the described configurations.\n\nRegarding the optimization parameters, they are explicitly mentioned in the context of the Faster R-CNN end-to-end training configuration. The use of stochastic gradient descent and the specific parameters for this optimization process are clearly outlined, ensuring reproducibility.\n\nThe supplementary materials, including tables and methods, are available online and can be accessed by researchers interested in replicating or building upon our work. The licensing details for accessing these materials are typically governed by the journal's policies, which usually allow for academic use and reproduction with proper citation.",
  "model/interpretability": "The automated visual evaluation algorithm is not a black box. To enhance interpretability, a system was implemented to generate heat maps. These heat maps highlight the regions of the cervigram images that most strongly influence the algorithm's predictions. The model typically focuses on the area surrounding the os and performs best when the cervix is oriented directly towards the camera. It is more influenced by regions with visible texture than by smooth areas. The model generally ignores glare from the camera's light and other distractions, although in some cases, the presence of non-cervix objects like cotton swabs can affect its predictions. This approach allows for a clearer understanding of how the algorithm makes its decisions, providing transparency into its functioning.",
  "model/output": "The model is a classification model. It predicts the probability that a given cervical image represents a case of CIN2+ (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse). The output is a score ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, where a higher score indicates a higher likelihood of the image being a case of CIN2+. This score is used to classify the images into positive or negative cases based on a chosen cutpoint that maximizes Youden's index, which considers both sensitivity and specificity. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity. The final model provides both the predicted cervix location and the case probability score.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "The source code for the automated visual evaluation algorithm is not publicly released. However, the techniques used in the algorithm are described in the supplementary methods, which are available online. This includes details about the system architecture, the Faster R-CNN algorithm, and the transfer learning process. Additionally, the supplementary materials include figures and tables that provide further insights into the model's performance and the data augmentation techniques used.\n\nThe algorithm itself is not available as an executable, web server, virtual machine, or container instance for public use. The focus of the publication is on the methodology and the results obtained from the algorithm, rather than on providing a publicly accessible tool. The algorithm was developed and validated using a specific dataset from the Guanacaste cohort, and its performance was evaluated against baseline screening tests such as cervicography, cytology, and HPV testing. The results demonstrate the algorithm's potential as a primary screening method for detecting CIN2+ cases, but the actual implementation of the algorithm is not part of the public release.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the automated visual evaluation algorithm involved several steps and techniques to ensure its robustness and accuracy. Initially, the algorithm was trained using approximately 70% of the available cases and frequency-matched controls, with the remaining 30% reserved for the initial validation test set. This split ensured that the model's performance could be assessed on unseen data.\n\nTo further validate the findings, collaborators from the National Library of Medicine independently checked the technique. They conducted confirmatory experiments using different subsets of the Guanacaste cohort images for model training and tested the trained network with altered images to represent different camera zooms and moderate image resizing. This external validation increased the credibility of the original findings by replication outside of the inventing group.\n\nThe automated visual evaluation detection algorithm yields a score ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, predicting whether the image represents a case of histologic CIN2+. The reproducibility of these scores was examined by comparing 322 replicate pairs of images, resulting in a very high Pearson correlation within pairs (0.97), justifying the use of only one image per pair for subsequent analyses.\n\nThe main validation analysis focused on images taken at cohort enrollment visits and evaluated the accuracy of the automated visual evaluation algorithm compared with baseline screening tests such as cervicography, cytology, and HPV testing. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and their summary statistic, the area under the curve (AUC), were used to evaluate the algorithm's performance. The AUC values were tested for statistical significance against the AUC for automated visual evaluation using two-sided chi-squared tests.\n\nFor analyses requiring a categorical positive/negative result, a cutpoint in the continuous score distribution was chosen that maximized Youden\u2019s index (sensitivity + specificity \u2013 1). This approach ensured that the algorithm's performance was optimized for the specific age groups in age-stratified analyses.\n\nAdditionally, a system was implemented to generate heat maps, visualizing which regions of the image most strongly influence the algorithm's prediction. This system helped in understanding the algorithm's decision-making process and identifying areas that needed improvement.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation method involved a combination of internal validation using a reserved test set, external validation by independent collaborators, and the use of statistical measures such as ROC curves and AUC to assess the algorithm's performance. These steps ensured a comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of the automated visual evaluation algorithm.",
  "evaluation/measure": "To evaluate the performance of the automated visual evaluation algorithm, several key metrics were reported. The primary metric used was the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), which provides a summary measure of the algorithm's accuracy. The AUC for the automated visual evaluation of enrollment cervical images across all ages was 0.91, indicating excellent performance. This metric was compared against other screening methods, including cervicography, conventional Pap smears, liquid-based cytology, first-generation neural network-based cytology, and HPV testing. The automated visual evaluation algorithm outperformed all these methods, demonstrating its superior accuracy.\n\nIn addition to the AUC, the algorithm's sensitivity and specificity were also assessed. Sensitivity refers to the algorithm's ability to correctly identify cases of CIN2+, while specificity refers to its ability to correctly identify non-cases. The sensitivity and specificity varied by age group, with the highest sensitivity observed in the 25\u201349 age group. The algorithm's performance was further validated by comparing replicate pairs of images, which showed a very high Pearson correlation within pairs, justifying the use of one image per pair for subsequent analyses.\n\nThe algorithm's performance was also evaluated using heat maps, which visualized the regions of the image that most strongly influenced the algorithm's predictions. This analysis provided insights into how the algorithm bases its predictions and highlighted the importance of the region surrounding the os and the orientation of the cervix.\n\nOverall, the reported performance metrics are comprehensive and representative of the state-of-the-art in the field. The use of AUC, sensitivity, and specificity, along with the validation through replicate image pairs and heat maps, provides a robust evaluation of the algorithm's performance. The comparison with other established screening methods further underscores the algorithm's effectiveness and potential for improving cervical cancer screening.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "The evaluation of the automated visual evaluation algorithm involved a comprehensive comparison with various established screening methods. The algorithm's performance was assessed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the curve (AUC) as the summary statistic. The AUC for the automated visual evaluation of enrollment cervical images was found to be 0.91, indicating high accuracy.\n\nThe algorithm's performance was compared with several other screening methods, including cervicography, conventional Pap smears, liquid-based cytology, first-generation neural network-based cytology, and HPV testing. The automated visual evaluation algorithm demonstrated statistically significant superiority over all these methods. Specifically, the AUC for cervicography was 0.69, for conventional Pap smears it was 0.71, for liquid-based cytology it was 0.79, for first-generation neural network-based cytology it was 0.70, and for HPV testing it was 0.82. All these comparisons showed that the automated visual evaluation algorithm outperformed the traditional methods.\n\nAdditionally, the algorithm's performance was evaluated in different age groups to assess its applicability across various demographics. The age groups considered were 18\u201324 years, 25\u201349 years, and 50+ years. The intermediate age group (25\u201349 years) was of primary interest due to the higher incidence of CIN2-CIN3 cases and the algorithm's higher sensitivity in this group.\n\nThe evaluation also included an analysis of discrepancies between the algorithm's results and HPV testing. The additional positives identified by the automated visual evaluation algorithm tended to occur among younger women and were more likely to be diagnosed with CIN2. This suggests that the algorithm may have the potential to identify cases that traditional methods might miss, particularly in younger populations.\n\nIn summary, the automated visual evaluation algorithm was rigorously compared with established screening methods and demonstrated superior performance across various metrics and age groups. This comprehensive evaluation underscores the algorithm's potential as a highly accurate and reliable tool for cervical cancer screening.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the automated visual evaluation algorithm included several performance metrics with associated confidence intervals. For instance, the Pearson correlation within replicate image pairs was reported with a 95% confidence interval, demonstrating high reproducibility. The area under the curve (AUC) for the automated visual evaluation algorithm was also provided with a 95% confidence interval, indicating the statistical significance of its performance.\n\nStatistical significance was assessed using two-sided chi-squared tests to compare the AUC values of the automated visual evaluation algorithm with those of other screening methods. These tests confirmed that the automated visual evaluation algorithm outperformed conventional Pap smears, liquid-based cytology, first-generation neural network-based cytology, and HPV testing, all with P-values less than 0.001. This level of statistical significance strongly supports the claim that the automated visual evaluation algorithm is superior to these baseline methods.\n\nAdditionally, the algorithm's performance was evaluated across different age groups, with sensitivity and specificity reported for each group. The results showed that the algorithm maintained high sensitivity and specificity across various age ranges, further validating its effectiveness. The use of heat maps to visualize the regions of the image that most influenced the algorithm's predictions also provided insights into the model's decision-making process, enhancing confidence in its reliability.",
