  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset utilized in this study was sourced from the Integrated Disease Surveillance & Response System (IDSRS) of KP province. This system is a robust platform designed to monitor and respond to disease outbreaks, providing comprehensive and real-time data on various health metrics, including malaria prevalence.\n\nThe dataset encompasses a substantial number of data points, covering malaria cases over several years. Specifically, the data includes yearly records from 2018 to 2022, detailing the number of malaria tests conducted, confirmed cases, and the distribution of different malaria parasites such as Plasmodium vivax (PV) and Plasmodium falciparum (PF). This extensive dataset allows for a detailed analysis of trends and patterns in malaria incidence over time.\n\nPrevious research and community efforts have also leveraged similar datasets to study malaria prevalence. For instance, studies have been conducted to understand the baseline survey for malaria prevalence in KP province, as well as the development of quick prediction tools for dengue fever, which shares similar epidemiological characteristics. These studies have contributed to the broader understanding of disease dynamics in the region and have informed public health strategies.\n\nThe dataset's richness and comprehensiveness make it a valuable resource for epidemiological research, enabling the development of accurate predictive models and the implementation of effective disease management strategies.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into two primary splits: a training set and a test set. The training set was used to train the hybrid model, which integrated Prophet and TBATS methods. This set included historical data up to a certain cutoff point, allowing the model to learn from past trends and seasonal patterns. The test set, on the other hand, was used to evaluate the model's performance by assessing how well it could predict future malaria cases based on the data it had learned from.\n\nThe specific number of data points in each split is not detailed, but the process involved checking for missing values, handling outliers, and transforming the data if necessary to ensure its appropriateness for analysis. This preprocessing step was crucial for the model's accuracy and reliability.\n\nThe dataset also included a subset of month-wise malaria cases from January 2021 to December 2022, which permitted an in-depth analysis of trends and patterns on a monthly basis over this specific period. This subset was likely used to fine-tune the model and ensure it could capture the nuances of malaria incidence over shorter time frames.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our study leverages a hybrid model approach, integrating the Prophet and TBATS methods for time series forecasting. This innovative approach is designed to capture the complexities of malaria data, thereby enhancing predictive accuracy.\n\nThe Prophet model, developed by Facebook, is a well-established time series forecasting tool that decomposes the time series into trend, seasonal, and holiday components. It is particularly effective in handling data with strong seasonal effects and multiple seasonalities. The TBATS model, on the other hand, is a specialized time series model that can capture multiple seasonalities, trends, and errors, making it robust for complex datasets.\n\nThe combination of these two models allows for a comprehensive analysis of malaria incidence patterns. The Prophet model excels in capturing seasonal trends and holiday effects, while the TBATS model handles cyclic patterns and nonlinearities. This synergy enables the hybrid model to provide more accurate and reliable forecasts.\n\nThe machine-learning algorithm class used in this study is that of time series forecasting models, specifically hybrid models that combine the strengths of Prophet and TBATS. These models are not new but are applied innovatively in the context of malaria prediction. The choice to publish in a health journal rather than a machine-learning journal is driven by the focus on the application of these models to public health issues, specifically malaria prediction. The primary goal is to contribute to the field of epidemiology and global health by providing robust tools for disease management and forecasting.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employed in this study is not a meta-predictor. Instead, it utilizes a hybrid approach that combines the forecasting capabilities of two distinct time series models: Prophet and TBATS. These models are trained independently on the same dataset, and their predictions are not used as inputs to another machine-learning algorithm.\n\nThe Prophet model is designed to handle time series data with strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. It decomposes the time series into trend, seasonal, and holiday components, allowing it to capture complex patterns in the data. The TBATS model, on the other hand, is particularly effective at handling multiple seasonalities and nonlinear trends. It incorporates Box\u2013Cox transformation, ARMA errors, trends, and seasonal components to provide accurate forecasts.\n\nBoth models are trained on the same historical data, ensuring that the training data is independent for each model. The hybrid model leverages the strengths of both Prophet and TBATS to produce more accurate and reliable forecasts. By combining these two models, the hybrid approach is able to capture a wider range of patterns and trends in the data, leading to improved predictive performance.\n\nThe evaluation of the hybrid model's performance involved comparing it with other widely used time series models, such as ARIMA, ETS, and ANN. The hybrid model demonstrated superior accuracy, as evidenced by lower values for Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). This indicates that the hybrid model's predictions had smaller deviations from the actual data and significantly reduced percentage errors.\n\nIn summary, the model used in this study is a hybrid of Prophet and TBATS, trained independently on the same dataset, and does not rely on data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. The combination of these two models enhances the forecasting accuracy and reliability for malaria prediction.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, data encoding and preprocessing were crucial steps to ensure the effectiveness of our machine-learning algorithms. The raw data, which included malaria cases from 2018 to 2022, underwent several preprocessing steps to make it suitable for analysis. Initially, we checked for and handled any missing values to maintain data integrity. Outliers were identified and managed to prevent them from skewing the model's predictions. Data transformation techniques, such as normalization or standardization, were applied to ensure that all features contributed equally to the model's learning process.\n\nFor the hybrid model integrating Prophet and TBATS, the data was split into training and test sets. The training set was used to capture fundamental patterns and seasonality, while the test set was used to evaluate the model's performance. This split allowed us to assess the model's ability to generalize from historical data to future predictions.\n\nThe Prophet model, known for its flexibility in capturing seasonal patterns and trends, was particularly useful for handling the time series data. It incorporated a piecewise-linear trend function and seasonal components, along with holiday effects and a white noise error term to account for random fluctuations. The TBATS model, on the other hand, was effective in capturing multiple seasonalities and incorporating Box\u2013Cox transformations, ARMA errors, trends, and seasonal components.\n\nThe hybrid model combined these strengths, using the Prophet component to handle the growth term and seasonal patterns, and the TBATS component to manage level, trend, and seasonal variations. This approach ensured that the model could accurately forecast malaria cases by leveraging the historical patterns and seasonality captured during the training phase. The entire process was developed using R-statistical software, version 4.2.2, which provided the necessary tools for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the hybrid model utilized several parameters to capture the complexities of malaria data. The Prophet model, one component of the hybrid approach, incorporates a piecewise-linear trend function, seasonal patterns, holiday effects, and a white noise error term. The TBATS model, the other component, includes level, trend, seasonal components, and an error term. The specific number of parameters can vary depending on the data and the model configuration.\n\nThe selection of parameters was guided by the need to accurately capture the seasonal and trend components in the malaria data. For the Prophet model, the trend function and seasonal patterns were chosen based on historical data to ensure they could flexibly capture various time series patterns. The TBATS model's parameters were selected to handle multiple seasonalities and incorporate transformations like Box\u2013Cox, ARMA errors, trends, and seasonal components.\n\nThe hybrid model was trained using historical data up to a certain cutoff point, and the dataset was separated into training and test sets. The training set was used to fit the models and select the optimal parameters, while the test set was used to assess the performance of the models. This process ensured that the selected parameters were robust and could generalize well to new data.",

  "optimization/fitting": "The hybrid model employed in this study integrates the Prophet and TBATS models to forecast malaria cases. The Prophet model, known for its flexibility in capturing various time series patterns, includes a piecewise-linear trend function, seasonal patterns, holiday effects, and a white noise error term. The TBATS model, on the other hand, handles multiple seasonalities and incorporates Box\u2013Cox transformation, ARMA errors, trends, and seasonal components.\n\nTo ensure the model's robustness, several steps were taken to address potential overfitting and underfitting issues. The data underwent rigorous preprocessing, including checking for missing values, handling outliers, and transforming the data if necessary. This preprocessing step is crucial as it ensures the data's appropriateness for analysis and helps in mitigating the risk of overfitting by removing noise and inconsistencies.\n\nThe dataset was divided into a training set and a test set. The training set was used to train the model, while the test set was used to assess its performance. This separation helps in evaluating the model's generalization capability, ensuring that it performs well on unseen data and not just on the training data. By training the Prophet and TBATS models distinctly on the training set, the hybrid model captures fundamental outlines and seasonality effectively.\n\nThe evaluation metrics used, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), provided insights into the model\u2019s fit, accuracy, and predictive performance. The hybrid model achieved lower values for these metrics compared to other models, indicating smaller deviations from the actual data and significantly reduced percentage errors. This suggests that the model is neither overfitting nor underfitting the data.\n\nAdditionally, the hybrid model's performance was compared with other widely used time series models, such as ARIMA, ETS, and ANN. This comparison further validated the hybrid model's effectiveness in capturing the intricacies of malaria data and improving predictive accuracy. The lower MAE, RMSE, and MAPE values of the hybrid model compared to these other models underscore its reliability and accuracy in forecasting malaria cases.",

  "optimization/config": "Not applicable.",
  "model/interpretability": "The hybrid model employed in this study, which integrates the Prophet and TBATS models, offers a level of interpretability that is crucial for understanding the underlying patterns in malaria data. Unlike black-box models, the hybrid approach provides transparency through its decomposable components.\n\nThe Prophet model, for instance, breaks down the time series into several interpretable components: a piecewise-linear trend function, seasonal patterns, holiday effects, and a white noise error term. This decomposition allows for a clear understanding of how each component contributes to the overall forecast. The trend function captures the long-term growth or decay in malaria cases, while the seasonal patterns highlight recurring cycles within the data. The inclusion of holiday effects accounts for any anomalies that might occur due to specific events, and the error term represents random fluctuations.\n\nSimilarly, the TBATS model incorporates key components such as the level, trend, seasonal, and error terms. The level component signifies the overall average behavior of the time series, the trend component captures the long-term direction, and the seasonal component identifies repeating patterns within a single season. The error term accounts for random variations that are not explained by the other components. This structured approach ensures that each part of the model is interpretable, making it easier to understand how different factors influence malaria prevalence.\n\nBy combining these models, the hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both, providing a comprehensive and transparent framework for forecasting malaria cases. This interpretability is essential for public health authorities and policymakers, as it allows them to make informed decisions based on clear and understandable insights derived from the model.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in this study is a regression model. It is designed to forecast future malaria cases, specifically for the year 2023 in the KP province. The hybrid model integrates the Prophet and TBATS methods, which are both time series forecasting techniques. These models are used to capture various components of the data, including trends, seasonality, and cyclic patterns, to make accurate predictions about the number of malaria cases. The evaluation metrics used, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), further indicate that the model's primary goal is to predict continuous values rather than classify data into discrete categories. Therefore, the model is a regression model aimed at predicting the number of malaria cases based on historical data.",

  "evaluation/method": "To evaluate the accuracy of the models, several assessment metrics were employed. These included Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). These metrics provided insights into the model\u2019s fit, accuracy, and predictive performance.\n\nThe hybrid model, which integrated Prophet and TBATS methods, was compared with other widely used time series models, such as ARIMA, ETS, and ANN. This comparison aimed to identify the most effective prediction method for malaria prediction, paving the way for more reliable and timely disease management strategies.\n\nThe hybrid model achieved lower values for MAE, RMSE, and MAPE compared to the other models. Specifically, the hybrid model had an MAE of 8913.9, an RMSE of 3850.2, and a MAPE of 0.301. These lower values indicate that the hybrid model\u2019s predictions had smaller deviations from the actual data and significantly reduced percentage errors.\n\nThe evaluation process involved training the models on historical data and then assessing their performance on a test set. This approach ensured that the models were robust and could generalize well to new data. The hybrid model's superior performance in terms of evaluation metrics highlights its effectiveness in capturing the intricacies of malaria data and improving predictive accuracy.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed several key performance metrics to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of our forecasting models. These metrics included Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). These metrics are widely recognized in the literature and provide a comprehensive assessment of model performance.\n\nMAE measures the average magnitude of errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. It gives an idea of how wrong the predictions are on average. RMSE, on the other hand, measures the square root of the average of squared errors, giving more weight to larger errors. This metric is particularly useful when large errors are particularly undesirable. MAPE represents the average absolute percent error between predicted and actual values, providing a percentage measure of prediction accuracy.\n\nThe use of these metrics is representative of standard practices in the field of time series forecasting and epidemiological modeling. They allow for a clear comparison of our hybrid model's performance against other widely used models such as ARIMA, ETS, and ANN. By reporting these metrics, we ensure that our evaluation is robust and transparent, enabling other researchers and practitioners to understand the strengths and limitations of our approach. The hybrid model demonstrated lower values for MAE, RMSE, and MAPE compared to the other models, indicating its superior performance in predicting malaria incidence.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we conducted a thorough comparison of our hybrid model with several widely used time series forecasting methods to ensure robust evaluation. The models we compared against included ARIMA, ETS, and ANN. These models were chosen because they represent different approaches to time series forecasting and are commonly used in the field.\n\nARIMA, or Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average, is a well-established method that captures both autoregressive and moving average components. It is particularly effective for handling non-stationary time series data by differencing the data to achieve stationarity. This makes ARIMA suitable for predicting short to medium-term tasks and capturing linear relationships within the data. The flexibility of ARIMA in adjusting model parameters allows it to capture various patterns found in time series data.\n\nThe Exponential Smoothing State Space (ETS) model is another significant approach for forecasting time series. ETS models are simple to employ and flexible, making them useful for data with trends or seasonality. They are particularly effective for short-term prediction tasks due to their simplicity and ease of implementation, especially when data patterns are relatively stable.\n\nArtificial Neural Networks (ANN) are advanced machine learning approaches that excel at classifying complex and non-linear relationships in time series data. ANN models do not require robust assumptions about data distribution and can automatically detect underlying patterns. They are well-suited for forecasting tasks with diverse and large datasets, handling missing data and multiple input variables, which allows them to capture interactions between various factors influencing time series.\n\nBy comparing our hybrid model with these established methods, we aimed to identify the most effective prediction method for malaria cases. This comparison provided insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each model, helping us to validate the superiority of our hybrid approach. The evaluation metrics used, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), further supported the accuracy and reliability of our hybrid model in forecasting malaria incidence.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "Evaluation Confidence\n\nThe evaluation of the hybrid model's performance was conducted using several key metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). These metrics provided a comprehensive assessment of the model's accuracy and reliability. The hybrid model demonstrated lower values for MAE (8913.9) and RMSE (3850.2), indicating smaller deviations from the actual data. Additionally, the lower MAPE (0.301) value signified significantly reduced percentage errors, highlighting the model's precision.\n\nThe statistical significance of these results was not explicitly detailed in terms of confidence intervals or p-values. However, the consistent outperformance of the hybrid model compared to traditional time series models such as ARIMA, ETS, and ANN suggests a strong indication of its superiority. The hybrid model's ability to capture intricate data patterns, including seasonal and cyclic components, contributed to its enhanced predictive accuracy.\n\nWhile the specific statistical tests and confidence intervals were not provided, the comparative analysis against established models and the clear improvement in evaluation metrics imply a high level of confidence in the hybrid model's performance. Further statistical validation and detailed confidence intervals would strengthen the claims of the model's superiority, but the current results are compelling and indicate a robust forecasting capability.",
