  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Specifically, the discovery cohort, which served as the training set, was derived from the raw data of GSE189993. This dataset included 21 disease samples from patients with moyamoya disease (MMD) and 11 control samples from non-MMD patients. The majority of the MMD samples in the training set were from patients aged between 30 and 60 years old, with only two samples from patients under 18 years old. Atherosclerotic disease was excluded from this dataset.\n\nThe validation set consisted of self-test data, which included gene expression data from 13 patients. This set comprised 3 non-MMD patients and 10 MMD patients. The samples were obtained from patients during surgery, and detailed clinical features of the participants were provided. All participants in both the MMD and non-MMD groups were adults, and atherosclerotic disease was excluded from this set as well.\n\nThe dataset underwent batch correction using the Combat function in the SVA package, which employs empirical Bayesian methods to estimate and adjust for batch effects. This process involved calculating adjustment factors for each gene based on the variance of the gene and the size of the batch effect, ensuring that the expression values were accurately adjusted across different batches. After removing the batch effects, the dataset was used for subsequent analysis.\n\nThe study also utilized data from GSE157628 from the GEO database, which included 20 samples. All samples in the discovery cohort came from the same organization and single ethnic group, which may limit the representativeness of the study. Future research would benefit from including more samples from multiple ethnic groups to further validate the findings.",
  "dataset/splits": "The study utilized two main data splits: a training set and a validation set. The training set consisted of 32 samples from the GSE189993 dataset, which included 21 disease samples (MMD) and 11 control samples. The validation set comprised 20 samples from self-test data, including 13 patients with 10 MMD patients and 3 non-MMD patients. All participants in both groups were adults, and atherosclerotic disease was excluded from the datasets. The training set primarily included patients aged between 30 and 60 years old, with only 2 patients under 18 years old. The validation set also consisted of adult patients. The datasets were preprocessed to remove batch effects, ensuring that systematic biases between MMD data and control data were eliminated. This preprocessing step was crucial for obtaining reliable results in subsequent analyses.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets used in this study were split into a discovery cohort (training set) and a validation set. The discovery cohort consisted of raw data from GSE189993 in the GEO database, which included 21 disease samples (MMD) and 11 control samples. The majority of MMD samples in the training set were from patients aged 30 to 60 years old, with only 2 samples from patients under 18 years old. Atherosclerotic disease was excluded from this dataset. Batch correction was performed using the Combat function in the SVA package to eliminate systematic bias between MMD data and control data.\n\nThe validation set included gene expression data from 13 patients, comprising 3 non-MMD patients and 10 MMD patients. These samples were obtained from patients during surgery, and all participants were adults. Atherosclerotic disease was also excluded from the validation set. The detailed clinical features of the included participants were provided.\n\nThe training and validation sets were independent. The training set was derived from publicly available data (GSE189993), while the validation set consisted of self-test data collected from patients during surgery. This independence was enforced by ensuring that the samples in the validation set were not part of the discovery cohort and were collected separately.\n\nThe distribution of the datasets compares favorably to previously published machine learning datasets in the context of MMD research. The training set included a diverse age range of MMD patients, and the validation set consisted of adult patients, ensuring a representative sample for model training and validation. The exclusion of atherosclerotic disease from both datasets helped in focusing on the specific characteristics of MMD.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data presented in this study are not publicly available in a forum. They are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. This approach ensures that the data can be shared with other researchers while maintaining control over its distribution and usage. The decision to not release the data publicly may be due to privacy concerns, the need for further validation, or the desire to collaborate directly with other researchers. The data includes gene expression profiles from patients with moyamoya disease (MMD) and control samples, which were used to identify differentially expressed genes and necroptosis and necroinflammation-related genes. The study utilized data from the GEO database for the training set and self-test data for validation. The specific datasets used were GSE189993 and GSE157628, which were obtained from a single organization and ethnic group. This approach allows for more controlled sharing and potential collaboration, ensuring that the data is used responsibly and ethically.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithms used in this study are well-established and widely recognized in the field. Specifically, the algorithms employed include Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Generalized Linear Model (GLM), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (xgboost). These algorithms are part of the broader class of supervised learning methods, which are commonly used for classification and regression tasks in various domains, including bioinformatics and medical research.\n\nThe algorithms utilized are not new; they have been extensively studied and applied in numerous research and industrial applications. The choice of these algorithms was driven by their proven effectiveness in handling complex datasets and their ability to provide robust predictive models. The SVM algorithm, in particular, was identified as the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics such as residual reverse cumulative distribution, residual box plot, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The SVM model demonstrated the smallest residual and an AUC value greater than 0.8, indicating its superior predictive performance.\n\nThe decision to use these established algorithms in a biomedical context, rather than a machine-learning journal, is justified by the specific goals of the study. The primary focus was on understanding the underlying mechanisms of necroptosis and necroinflammation in Moyamoya disease (MMD) and identifying key genes related to this condition. The machine-learning algorithms served as tools to achieve these biological and medical objectives, rather than being the main subject of the research. Therefore, the study was published in a biomedical journal to reach the relevant audience and contribute to the field of immunology and cerebrovascular disease research.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model developed in this study does not function as a meta-predictor. Instead, it utilizes several machine learning methods independently to select key genes related to Moyamoya disease (MMD) and create a prediction model based on the expression of these genes. The methods employed include random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), generalized linear model (GLM), and extreme gradient boosting (xgboost).\n\nEach of these methods was used to construct a prediction model for MMD. The performance of these models was evaluated using various metrics, including the residual reverse cumulative distribution map, residual box plot, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Among these models, the SVM model demonstrated the best performance, characterized by the smallest residual and an AUC value greater than 0.8.\n\nThe training data used for these models came from the GSE189993 dataset, which included 21 disease samples and 11 control samples. Batch effects were removed using the Combat function in the SVA package to ensure that the data was free from systematic bias. The validation set consisted of self-test data from 13 patients, including 3 non-MMD patients and 10 MMD patients. This separation ensures that the training and validation data are independent, providing a robust evaluation of the model's performance.\n\nThe top 20 explanatory variables with the highest contribution values in the SVM model were selected for further analysis. Among these, four genes\u2014ID1, ANXA1, PTGER3, and IL1R1\u2014passed validation and were identified as crucial for MMD prediction. The feature importance of these genes, from highest to lowest, is PTGER3, ANXA1, ID1, and IL1R1.

This process involved calculating adjustment factors for each gene based on the variance and batch effect size, which were then applied to the gene expression values to obtain adjusted values. This step was crucial for eliminating systematic biases between the MMD data and control data.\n\nAfter batch effect removal, the dataset was used as the training set for subsequent analyses. The validation set included gene expression data from 13 patients, comprising 3 non-MMD patients and 10 MMD patients. All participants in both groups were adults, and atherosclerotic disease was excluded. The validation set data were obtained from self-test samples collected during surgery.\n\nThe gene expression data underwent further preprocessing, including the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) based on a P-value threshold of less than 0.05 and a |logFC| greater than 1. This filtering resulted in 5320 DEGs. An intersection analysis with 238 necroptosis and necroinflammation-related genes (NiNRGs) identified 37 differentially expressed NiNRGs (DE-NiNRGs).\n\nThese DE-NiNRGs were then used as explanatory variables in the construction of various machine-learning models, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Generalized Linear Model (GLM), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (xgboost). The SVM model was ultimately selected as the best-performing model based on its residual reverse cumulative distribution, residual box plot, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The top 20 explanatory variables from the SVM model were extracted for further analysis, and a nomogram was generated using genes validated through the validation set.",

The selection of these top 20 genes was further validated through a validation set, ensuring their robustness and relevance in predicting moyamoya disease (MMD).\n\nThe final model incorporated these 20 genes, which were found to have the highest contribution values. This selection process was crucial in optimizing the model's performance, as evidenced by the residual reverse cumulative distribution map, residual box plot, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The SVM model demonstrated the smallest residual and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) value greater than 0.8, indicating its superior predictive performance compared to other models tested, such as Random Forest, Generalized Linear Model, and Extreme Gradient Boosting.",

We utilized machine learning methods, including the Support Vector Machine (SVM), to construct predictive models. The SVM model was chosen as the best model based on its performance metrics, such as the residual reverse cumulative distribution map, residual box plot, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.\n\nTo ensure robustness, the feature selection process was conducted using only the training set. This involved optimizing the model parameters and evaluating the explanatory properties of the genes. After selecting the best model, we extracted the top 20 explanatory variables that contributed most to the classification. These top 20 genes were then used to generate a nomogram for evaluating their influence on Moyamoya disease (MMD) prediction.

The number of parameters in our models was indeed larger than the number of training points, which could potentially lead to overfitting.\n\nTo mitigate overfitting, we utilized a validation set that was independent of the training set. This validation set included gene expression data from 13 patients, with 10 MMD patients and 3 non-MMD patients. The validation set helped us to assess the generalizability of our models and ensure that they were not merely memorizing the training data.\n\nAdditionally, we employed cross-validation techniques during the model training process. This involved splitting the training data into multiple folds and training the model on different combinations of these folds. By averaging the performance across these folds, we could obtain a more reliable estimate of the model's performance and reduce the risk of overfitting.\n\nTo rule out underfitting, we evaluated the performance of our models using various metrics, including the residual reverse cumulative distribution map, residual box plot, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.

To prevent overfitting, we utilized a combination of techniques.\n\nFirstly, we performed batch correction using the Combat function from the SVA package. This function employs empirical Bayesian methods to estimate and adjust for batch effects, reducing systematic bias between different datasets. By adjusting the expression values of genes based on the variance and batch effect size, we ensured that our models were trained on data that accurately reflected biological variations rather than technical artifacts.\n\nAdditionally, we used a validation set to assess the performance of our models. This set included gene expression data from patients who were not part of the training set, allowing us to evaluate the generalizability of our models. The validation set helped us to identify and mitigate overfitting by ensuring that the models performed well on unseen data.\n\nFurthermore, we selected the top 20 explanatory variables that contributed to the classification in the SVM model, which was identified as the best-performing model. This feature selection process helped to simplify the model and reduce the risk of overfitting by focusing on the most relevant genes.\n\nIn summary, we implemented batch correction, validation set assessment, and feature selection to prevent overfitting and enhance the robustness of our prediction models for MMD.",
