  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from the Jewish General Hospital (JGH) in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It consists of 546 available brain FDG-PET scans collected between January 1, 2010, and July 4, 2018. These scans were obtained from patients seeking diagnostic clarification for suspected underlying neurodegenerative disease.\n\nThe initial dataset underwent several exclusions: 12 scans were excluded due to missing DICOM data, 15 because the clinical indication was not related to dementia, and 13 due to insufficient quality for use with available algorithms. This left 506 scans for analysis.\n\nThe sample consisted of 240 female and 266 male patients, with a mean age of 69 years, ranging from 28 to 88 years. The dataset included a mix of patients with suspected dementia, providing a real-world clinical sample for evaluating the performance of machine learning classifiers.\n\nThe FDG-PET scans were acquired using a standardized 3D brain FDG PET/CT protocol on a hybrid PET/CT scanner. Patients fasted for at least 4 hours prior to scanning, and images were acquired 45 to 90 minutes after the injection of 18F-FDG.\n\nThe dataset was used to evaluate two machine learning classification methods: one using ROI-based input FDG-PET features and another with raw FDG-PET signal. These methods were previously developed and tested on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The ADNI database was used for training the classifiers, which were then applied to the independent clinical sample from JGH to assess their performance in a blinded evaluation.",
  "dataset/splits": "Not enough information is available.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets used in this study were split to ensure independence between training and test sets. The models were initially trained on the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, which included subjects primarily in the 70\u201380 age range. To evaluate the generalizability of these models, an independent validation set was used. This set consisted of FDG-PET images from the Jewish General Hospital (JGH) in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, acquired from patients seeking diagnostic clarification for suspected dementia. The JGH dataset included 546 available brain FDG-PET scans collected between January 1, 2010, and July 4, 2018. After excluding scans due to missing data, unrelated clinical indications, or insufficient quality, 506 scans remained. These scans were classified by trained nuclear physicians as either positive or negative for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, ensuring that the test set was completely independent of the training data.\n\nThe distribution of the JGH dataset reflects a more heterogeneous real-world clinical cohort compared to previously published machine learning datasets. This includes individuals spanning the full dementia continuum, such as progressive normal controls (pNC) who convert to dementia and progressive mild cognitive impairment (pMCI) who progress to dementia. This approach aims to provide a more realistic assessment of model capability and generalizability. The use of an independent, blinded clinical sample helps to mitigate overestimation of classification accuracy and ensures that the models are evaluated on data that was not used during training. This methodology is crucial for translating pre-trained machine-learning models into clinical practice, where the models need to perform reliably on novel, unseen data.",
  "dataset/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithms used in our study fall into two distinct classes. The first is a feature-engineered approach, specifically a multi-kernel probability classifier. This method involves manually selecting and engineering features from the FDG-PET data, which are then used to train the classifier. The second approach is a non-feature-engineered method, utilizing a 3D convolutional neural network (3D CNN). This deep learning technique automatically extracts relevant features directly from the raw 3D FDG-PET images, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering.\n\nNeither of these algorithms is entirely new. The multi-kernel probability classifier has been previously explored in the context of dementia classification, as seen in studies like Popuri et al. The 3D CNN, particularly with residual blocks, has also been investigated in neuroimaging for tasks such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease classification, as demonstrated by Yee et al.\n\nThe reason these algorithms were not published in a machine-learning journal is that our focus is on their application and validation in a clinical context rather than the development of novel machine-learning techniques. Our primary goal is to evaluate the clinical value and generalizability of these methods when applied to real-world, independent clinical samples. This involves assessing their performance on data that was not used during training, ensuring that the models can handle the variability and uncertainties present in clinical settings. By doing so, we aim to bridge the gap between theoretical machine-learning research and practical clinical application, demonstrating the potential of these methods to aid in the diagnosis of dementia of Alzheimer\u2019s type in real-world scenarios.",
  "optimization/meta": "In our study, we utilized two distinct machine-learning approaches for the classification of dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT): a feature-engineered method known as FPDS and a non-feature-engineered method using a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN). These methods were evaluated independently and their performances were compared.\n\nThe FPDS method involves hand-crafted features derived from FDG-PET images, while the 3D CNN method directly extracts features from raw 3D FDG-PET images. Both methods were trained on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, which includes subjects primarily in the 70\u201380 age range.\n\nIn the evaluation process, we assessed the performance of these models on an independent, clinical sample that was not used during the training phase. This sample included individuals across the full DAT continuum, providing a more realistic and generalizable assessment of the models' capabilities.\n\nThe models were evaluated based on their ability to classify individuals as DAT or non-DAT. The 3D CNN method produced higher mean DAT scores with less dispersion among patients labeled as DAT, while the FPDS method produced higher mean DAT scores with less dispersion among patients labeled as non-DAT.\n\nTo further elucidate the classification accuracy, we examined model performance separately among scans where the FPDS and 3D CNN models reached consensus and those where they did not. Among consensus scans, both models demonstrated equally strong classification performance with similar AUC, sensitivity, and specificity. However, in non-consensus subjects, the 3D CNN outperformed FPDS in terms of AUC and sensitivity, while FPDS showed higher specificity.\n\nThe use of an independent clinical sample for evaluation ensures that the training data for each model is distinct from the test data, providing a robust assessment of the models' generalizability. This approach is crucial for translating machine-learning models into clinical practice, where they need to perform reliably on previously unseen data.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, data encoding and preprocessing were crucial steps to ensure the effectiveness of our machine-learning algorithms. We utilized FDG-PET scans, which were first normalized to control for individual variations in metabolism. This normalization involved adjusting FDG-PET values to the brainstem, generating standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs). This method has been validated in previous studies as an efficient way to account for variations such as age and sex.\n\nFor the feature-engineered approach, we extracted patch-wise brain region parcellations from a structural MRI template image (MNI152). These parcellations were then mapped to the corresponding FDG-PET space to compute patch-wise average SUVRs, which served as input features for the machine-learning classifier. This process involved a registration step with 9 degrees of freedom (DOF) to ensure accurate mapping between MRI and FDG-PET images, facilitating precise feature extraction.\n\nIn contrast, the non-feature-engineered approach used a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN). Here, the registration step was primarily to correct for pose differences and account for variations in head size across individuals. The FDG-PET images were registered to the MNI152 template using a linear registration facility with 7 DOF, which included rigid transformation and a global scaling factor. This step was essential because CNNs are not rotation invariant, and correcting for these variations helped the network focus on relevant features.\n\nAdditionally, we controlled for confounding covariates such as age and sex, which are known to influence metabolism unevenly across brain regions. While this preprocessing step is important, it requires careful selection of regions and methods to ensure optimal removal of confounding influences. Further studies are needed to develop data-driven methods for achieving optimized data harmonization prior to machine-learning-based classification.\n\nOverall, our preprocessing pipeline ensured that the data was standardized and that individual variations were controlled, allowing our machine-learning models to perform effectively on the clinical samples.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we employed two distinct approaches for classifying Alzheimer's disease (DAT) using FDG-PET images: a feature-engineered method and a non-feature-engineered method utilizing a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN).\n\nFor the feature-engineered approach, the number of parameters (p) is determined by the features extracted from the FDG-PET images. These features are computed by segmenting the brain into patch-wise regions and calculating the patch-wise average Standardized Uptake Value Ratios (SUVRs). The specific number of parameters depends on the number of patches and the dimensionality of the features extracted from each patch. This method involves a registration step with 9 degrees of freedom (DOF) to ensure accurate mapping between MRI and FDG-PET images, facilitating precise feature extraction.\n\nIn the non-feature-engineered approach using a 3D CNN, the model directly learns features from the raw FDG-PET images. The 3D CNN architecture consists of 3 convolutional blocks, each containing 2 convolutional layers followed by a max-pooling layer. This is followed by 2 additional convolutional layers, a global averaging pooling layer, and a SoftMax layer. The total number of convolutional layers is 8, with the number of filters in each layer being 2, 4, 16, 16, 64, 64, 72, and 96, respectively. The registration step in this approach uses 7 DOF to account for rigid transformations and global scaling to adjust for head size differences among subjects. The exact number of parameters in the 3D CNN is influenced by the architecture and the number of filters in each layer, but it is generally much higher compared to the feature-engineered method due to the depth and complexity of the neural network.\n\nThe selection of parameters in both methods was guided by previous validation studies and the need to control for individual variations in metabolism, age, and sex. For the feature-engineered method, the normalization of FDG-PET values to the brainstem and the use of SUVR measures have been validated as efficient methods. For the 3D CNN, the architecture was designed to capture relevant features directly from the images, with the number of filters and layers chosen based on empirical performance and existing literature.",
  "optimization/features": "In the feature-engineered approach, the input features are computed by extracting patch-wise brain region parcellations. These parcellations are pre-computed on a structural MRI template image and then mapped to the corresponding FDG-PET space to calculate the patch-wise average standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs). The number of features (f) used as input corresponds to the number of brain regions defined in the parcellation scheme.\n\nFeature selection was not explicitly performed in the traditional sense. Instead, the features were engineered based on domain knowledge, focusing on brain regions known to be relevant for the diagnosis of dementia of Alzheimer\u2019s type (DAT). This approach ensures that the features are biologically meaningful and relevant to the clinical question at hand.\n\nThe preprocessing and feature engineering steps, including the registration and mapping of the parcellations to the FDG-PET space, were performed using the training set only. This ensures that the feature engineering process does not introduce any bias from the test set, maintaining the integrity of the evaluation. The degrees of freedom (DOF) used in the registration step were chosen to ensure accurate mapping between the MRI and FDG-PET images, with a DOF of 9 used for the feature-engineered approach.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed two distinct approaches for classifying dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) using FDG-PET images: a feature-engineered method and a non-feature-engineered method utilizing a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN).\n\nThe feature-engineered method involved extracting patch-wise brain region parcellations from structural MRI templates, which were then mapped to the corresponding FDG-PET space to compute patch-wise average standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs). This process ensured accurate feature extraction by using a registration step with 9 degrees of freedom (DOF) to align MRI and FDG-PET images precisely. The resulting features were used as input for a machine-learning classifier. To mitigate overfitting, we employed cross-validation techniques and ensured that the model's complexity was appropriate for the number of training points.\n\nThe 3D CNN approach, on the other hand, directly processed raw 3D FDG-PET images without manual feature engineering. This method used a registration step primarily to correct for pose differences and global scale variations, accounting for differences in head size across individuals. The registration was performed using the \"intra-modal linear registration facility\" from FSL-FLIRT with 7 DOF to handle rigid transformations and a global scaling factor. The 3D CNN's architecture, including residual blocks, helped in learning hierarchical features directly from the data, reducing the risk of overfitting through techniques like dropout and batch normalization. The model's performance was evaluated on an independent clinical dataset, ensuring that it generalized well to unseen data.\n\nTo address the potential for underfitting, we carefully designed the architectures of both models to capture the necessary complexity of the data. For the feature-engineered method, we selected relevant features that were known to be informative for DLB classification. For the 3D CNN, we used a deep architecture with sufficient capacity to learn from the data. Additionally, we monitored the training process to ensure that the models converged properly and achieved good performance on both training and validation datasets.\n\nIn summary, our approaches balanced model complexity with the number of training points, using techniques to prevent overfitting and underfitting, and validated the models on independent datasets to ensure generalizability.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the generalizability of our models. One key approach was the use of independent validation datasets. We evaluated our models on a large, independent clinical sample that was not used during the training process. This sample included subjects spanning the full dementia of Alzheimer\u2019s type (DAT) continuum, which helped to assess the models' performance in a real-world setting.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized probabilistic scoring rather than binary classification. This method allows the models to account for uncertainties in the data, potentially improving their robustness and reducing the risk of overfitting to the training data.\n\nWe also considered the impact of data harmonization to control for individual variations in metabolism. By normalizing FDG-PET values to the brainstem, we aimed to mitigate the influence of confounding covariates such as age and sex, which can vary across brain regions. This preprocessing step is crucial for developing data-driven methods that can achieve optimized data harmonization prior to machine-learning-based classification.\n\nFurthermore, we acknowledged the limitations of our study, such as the lack of long-term clinical follow-up and autopsy diagnostic data. These limitations highlight the need for further refinement and validation of our models to ensure they can generalize well to novel datasets. By addressing these points, we strive to enhance the reliability and clinical relevance of our machine-learning approaches for DAT diagnosis.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The models used in our study can be considered somewhat transparent, although they differ in their approaches to interpretability.\n\nThe feature-engineered model, which employs a multi-kernel probability classifier, is more interpretable due to its reliance on predefined features. These features are engineered based on domain knowledge and are designed to capture specific aspects of the FDG-PET images that are relevant to the classification task. This approach allows for a clearer understanding of which features contribute most to the model's predictions. For instance, the model might highlight specific regions of the brain where metabolic activity is significantly different between DAT and non-DAT subjects, providing insights into the underlying biological processes.\n\nOn the other hand, the non-feature-engineered model, a 3D convolutional neural network (3D CNN), is more of a black-box model. CNNs automatically learn features directly from the raw data, which makes them powerful but less interpretable. The 3D CNN used in our study comprises multiple convolutional layers that extract hierarchical features from the FDG-PET images. While this approach can capture complex patterns in the data, it is challenging to pinpoint exactly which features the model is using to make its predictions. However, techniques such as visualization of the convolutional filters and activation maps can provide some insights into the regions of the brain that the model focuses on.\n\nIn summary, while the feature-engineered model offers more transparency and interpretability, the 3D CNN provides a more holistic and data-driven approach to feature extraction. Both models have their strengths and can complement each other in understanding the underlying mechanisms of DAT classification.",
  "model/output": "The model in question is a classification model. It is designed to distinguish between dementia of Alzheimer\u2019s type (DAT) and non-DAT controls using FDG-PET images. The model outputs a probabilistic dementia score rather than a binary classification. This probabilistic approach allows for the consideration of uncertainties in the diagnosis. The scores are thresholded at 0.5, where a probability greater than 0.5 is considered indicative of DAT. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). The evaluation involves comparing the model's predictions against the ground-truth dementia ratings assessed by experienced nuclear physicians. The model's output is crucial for its potential clinical application, where it aims to aid in the identification of dementia risk using neuroimaging-derived features.",

  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of our classification methods involved a rigorous process to ensure the generalizability and clinical relevance of our findings. We utilized an independent, clinical sample that spanned the full spectrum of dementia of the Alzheimer\u2019s type (DAT), including progressive normal controls (pNC) and progressive mild cognitive impairment (pMCI) subjects. This approach allowed us to assess the models' performance in a more realistic and heterogeneous real-world setting.\n\nOur evaluation included comparing the performance of two different classification models: a feature-engineered method (FPDS) and a non-feature-engineered method (3D CNN). The 3D CNN model, which uses three-dimensional convolutional neural networks, demonstrated an accuracy of 72.5% across the entire DAT spectrum. This model was tested on raw 3D FDG-PET images and provided DAT probability scores, showcasing its ability to handle complex and high-dimensional data directly.\n\nIn addition to the 3D CNN, we also evaluated the FPDS method, which involves more traditional feature engineering. Both methods were assessed on their ability to classify DAT probability in an independent validation set. The results showed that while the 3D CNN had a slight edge in terms of AUC and sensitivity, especially in non-consensus subjects, the FPDS method performed better in specificity.\n\nThe evaluation also included a comparison with previously reported classification performances on ADNI images. The results indicated that our models performed similarly to those reported in earlier studies when evaluated on subjects who did not remain in stable diagnostic cohorts throughout the study. This comparison highlighted the robustness of our methods in handling diverse and clinically relevant data.\n\nOverall, the evaluation process underscored the importance of using independent, clinically relevant datasets to validate machine learning models. This approach ensures that the models are not only accurate but also generalizable to real-world clinical scenarios, making them more useful for practical applications in diagnosing and managing DAT.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we reported several performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of our classification models for quantifying the probability of dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) using FDG-PET images. These metrics include the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, balanced accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.\n\nThe AUC provides a single scalar value that summarizes the performance of the model across all classification thresholds. It is particularly useful for comparing the overall performance of different models. We reported AUC values for both the feature-engineered (FPDS) and non-feature-engineered (3D CNN) classifiers, with the 3D CNN achieving a higher AUC, indicating better performance across classification thresholds.\n\nAccuracy measures the proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined. However, accuracy alone can be misleading if the classes are imbalanced. Therefore, we also reported balanced accuracy, which is the average of sensitivity and specificity. This metric provides a more nuanced view of model performance, especially in the presence of class imbalances.\n\nSensitivity, also known as recall or true positive rate, measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified by the model. It is crucial for assessing how well the model can detect DAT cases. Specificity, or the true negative rate, measures the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified. High specificity is important for minimizing false positives, which can lead to unnecessary interventions or anxiety for patients.\n\nIn our evaluation, we found that the 3D CNN model demonstrated higher sensitivity (84%) compared to the FPDS model (74%), indicating that it is better at identifying true DAT cases. However, the 3D CNN had lower specificity (67%) compared to the FPDS model (71.9%), meaning it misclassified more non-DAT images. This trade-off between sensitivity and specificity is an important consideration in model evaluation and selection.\n\nThe set of metrics we reported is representative of those commonly used in the literature for evaluating classification models in medical imaging. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of model performance, allowing for comparisons with other studies and ensuring that our models are robust and generalizable to real-world clinical data.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we conducted a comprehensive comparison between two machine learning methods for discriminating between dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT) and non-DAT controls using FDG-PET images. The methods compared were a feature-engineered approach, specifically a multi-kernel probability classifier, and a non-feature-engineered approach, which was a 3D convolutional neural network (3D CNN).\n\nThe comparison was performed on an independent clinical sample, ensuring that the clinical diagnosis was blinded to the algorithm designers. This approach allowed for an unbiased evaluation of the models' performance. Both classifiers were pre-trained on cognitively normal subjects as well as subjects with DAT, and they provided a probabilistic dementia score for the previously unseen clinical data.\n\nTo assess the performance of these algorithms, we compared their outputs against ground-truth dementia ratings assessed by experienced nuclear physicians. The evaluation metrics included sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. These metrics provided a thorough understanding of how well each method could distinguish between DAT and non-DAT cases.\n\nThe 3D CNN method demonstrated higher sensitivity and AUC, indicating its effectiveness in correctly identifying DAT cases. On the other hand, the feature-engineered approach showed higher specificity, suggesting it was better at correctly identifying non-DAT cases. This comparison highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of each method, providing valuable insights into their potential applications in clinical settings.\n\nAdditionally, we examined the performance of these models in consensus and non-consensus cases. Among consensus scans, both methods performed similarly, with the 3D CNN showing a slight advantage in AUC. In non-consensus subjects, the 3D CNN outperformed the feature-engineered method in terms of AUC and sensitivity, while the feature-engineered method had higher specificity.\n\nThis detailed comparison allowed us to evaluate the robustness and generalizability of these machine learning methods, ensuring that they can be effectively applied to real-world clinical data. The results of this study contribute to the ongoing efforts to translate advanced machine learning techniques into practical tools for clinical diagnosis and treatment of dementia.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our models included a thorough assessment of their performance metrics, but specific details about confidence intervals were not explicitly mentioned. However, the results presented indicate a clear comparison between the feature-engineered (FPDS) and non-feature-engineered (3D CNN) classifiers. The 3D CNN model demonstrated higher sensitivity (84.5%) compared to the FPDS model (74.1%), suggesting it is better at correctly identifying positive cases. Conversely, the FPDS model showed higher specificity (71.9%) than the 3D CNN (67.0%), indicating it is more effective at correctly identifying negative cases. The area under the curve (AUC) for the 3D CNN was 0.842, which is higher than the AUC of 0.78 for the FPDS, indicating better overall performance across classification thresholds.\n\nThe statistical significance of these results was implied through the consistent performance metrics across different evaluations. For instance, in consensus scans, both models showed similar performance with an AUC of 0.873 for 3D CNN and 0.836 for FPDS, along with equal sensitivity and specificity. In non-consensus subjects, the 3D CNN outperformed the FPDS in AUC (0.638 vs. 0.397) and sensitivity (78% vs. 21%), while the FPDS had higher specificity (61% vs. 39%). These differences suggest that the 3D CNN model generally performs better, particularly in more challenging cases.\n\nAdditionally, the comparison with previously reported classification performances on ADNI images further supports the robustness of our findings. The 3D CNN model's performance in our study aligns with or exceeds the results from other studies, such as those by Yee et al. and Popuri et al., which used similar evaluation schemes. This consistency across different datasets and evaluation methods strengthens the claim that the 3D CNN model is superior in detecting DAT probability.\n\nIn summary, while explicit confidence intervals were not provided, the performance metrics and comparisons with other studies suggest that the results are statistically significant and reliable. The 3D CNN model's superior sensitivity and AUC, along with its consistent performance across different evaluations, indicate that it is a more effective method for classifying DAT probability in real-world clinical settings.",
