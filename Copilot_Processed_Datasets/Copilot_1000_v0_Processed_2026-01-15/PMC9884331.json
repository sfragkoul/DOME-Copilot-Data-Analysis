  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was collected from 100 mothers. The participants were divided into two groups: 50 in the case group and 50 in the control group. The case group consisted of mothers with diabetes, further categorized into those with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and those with overt diabetes. The control group included nondiabetic mothers.\n\nThe data collection involved various measurements and assessments. Key variables included the fetal left ventricular myocardial performance index (MPI), mitral valve (MV) E/A ratio, tricuspid valve (TV) E/A ratio, right ventricular wall thickness (RVWT), left ventricular wall thickness (LVWT), and interventricular septal thickness (IVST). These measurements were obtained using ultrasound and Doppler waveform techniques.\n\nThe dataset was used to develop and test decision tree (DT) algorithms, specifically classification and regression tree (CART) algorithms, chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID), and quick, unbiased, efficient, statistical tree (QUEST). The data was split into 70% for training the models and 30% for testing their performance.\n\nThe study did not mention any previous use of this specific dataset in other papers or by the community. The data was collected specifically for this research to analyze the predictors of fetal myocardial function in diabetic and nondiabetic mothers.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into two main splits: training data and test data. The total data was split into 70% for training and 30% for testing. This means that approximately 70 data points were used for training the decision tree algorithms, while the remaining 30 data points were used for testing the models. The performance of the decision tree models was evaluated on the test data using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset used in this study consisted of 100 mothers, with a mean age of 29.59 years and a mean gestational age of 23 weeks at the first examination. The dataset was divided into two main groups: the case group, which included mothers with diabetes (both gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and overt diabetes), and the control group, which included nondiabetic mothers. The case group consisted of 50 mothers, with 40 having GDM and 10 having overt diabetes.\n\nTo develop and test the decision tree (DT) algorithms, the total data were split into two subsets: 70% for training and 30% for testing. This split ensured that the training set was used to develop the models, while the test set was used to evaluate their performance independently. The independence of the training and test sets was enforced by randomly assigning 70% of the data to the training set and the remaining 30% to the test set, ensuring that there was no overlap between the two subsets.\n\nThe distribution of the dataset compares favorably with previously published machine learning datasets in the field of fetal cardiac function and maternal diabetes. The use of a balanced dataset, with an equal number of diabetic and nondiabetic mothers, allowed for a robust evaluation of the DT algorithms. The input variables, or predictors, included fetal left ventricular myocardial performance index (MPI), mitral valve (MV) E/A ratio, tricuspid valve (TV) E/A ratio, right ventricular wall thickness (RVWT), left ventricular wall thickness (LVWT), and interventricular septum thickness (IVST). These variables were carefully selected based on their relevance to fetal cardiac function and their potential to differentiate between diabetic and nondiabetic mothers.\n\nThe performance of the DT models was measured on the test data using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. This approach ensured that the models were evaluated on independent data, providing a reliable assessment of their generalizability and performance in real-world scenarios. The use of established statistical software, such as IBM SPSS Modeler and Payton software, further ensured the rigor and reproducibility of the analysis.",
  "dataset/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The study utilized decision tree (DT) algorithms for analysis. Specifically, three types of DT algorithms were employed: classification and regression tree (CART) algorithms, chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID), and quick, unbiased, efficient, statistical tree (QUEST). These algorithms are well-established in the field of machine learning and are commonly used for classification and regression tasks.\n\nThe algorithms used are not new; they are standard methods in the machine learning community. The choice to use these specific algorithms in this study was likely driven by their effectiveness in handling the types of data and the objectives of the research. The focus of the study was on comparing fetal myocardial function and ventricular thickness in diabetic and normal pregnancies, rather than on developing new machine-learning techniques. Therefore, it was appropriate to use established algorithms that are known to be reliable and effective for the tasks at hand.\n\nThe decision to publish the findings in a medical journal rather than a machine-learning journal is justified by the primary focus of the research. The study's main contributions are in the medical field, specifically in the area of fetal echocardiography and the impact of diabetes on fetal heart function. The machine-learning aspects of the study are secondary and serve as tools to achieve the primary medical objectives. Thus, publishing in a medical journal ensures that the findings reach the relevant audience of healthcare professionals and researchers in the field of obstetrics and gynecology.",
  "optimization/meta": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps. Initially, the target variable was defined based on the presence or absence of diabetes, categorizing participants into case (diabetic) and control (nondiabetic) groups. The input variables, or predictors, included the fetal left ventricular myocardial performance index (MPI), mitral valve (MV) E/A ratio, tricuspid valve (TV) E/A ratio, right ventricular wall thickness (RVWT), left ventricular wall thickness (LVWT), and interventricular septal thickness (IVST).\n\nThe data was divided into two subsets: 70% for training the decision tree (DT) algorithms and 30% for testing their performance. This split ensured that the models were trained on a substantial amount of data while leaving a sufficient portion for unbiased evaluation.\n\nThree types of decision tree algorithms were employed: classification and regression tree (CART), chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID), and quick, unbiased, efficient, statistical tree (QUEST). These algorithms were chosen for their ability to handle both classification and regression tasks, providing a robust framework for analyzing the predictors of fetal myocardial function.\n\nThe performance of the DT models was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity on the test data. This approach ensured that the models were not only accurate but also capable of correctly identifying positive and negative cases, which is crucial for clinical applications.\n\nStatistical analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS Modeler software (version 18) and Payton software (version 1). A P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant, guiding the interpretation of the results and the reliability of the findings.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, six input parameters were used in the decision tree models. These parameters, or predictors, were selected based on their relevance to fetal cardiac function and their potential to differentiate between diabetic and nondiabetic cases. The parameters included the fetal left ventricular myocardial performance index (MPI), mitral valve (MV) E/A ratio, tricuspid valve (TV) E/A ratio, right ventricular wall thickness (RVWT), left ventricular wall thickness (LVWT), and interventricular septal thickness (IVST).\n\nThe selection of these parameters was guided by existing literature and clinical expertise, focusing on variables that have been shown to be significant in assessing fetal cardiac health. The MPI, for instance, is a well-established indicator of both systolic and diastolic heart function. The E/A ratios for the mitral and tricuspid valves provide insights into diastolic cardiac function, while the measurements of RVWT, LVWT, and IVST offer information on ventricular wall thickness, which can be indicative of cardiac stress or hypertrophy.\n\nThe choice of these six parameters was also influenced by the need to balance model complexity and performance. Using too many parameters could lead to overfitting, while using too few might result in an underfitted model that fails to capture the underlying patterns in the data. Therefore, these six parameters were deemed sufficient to provide a comprehensive assessment of fetal cardiac function in the context of maternal diabetes.",
  "optimization/features": "The study utilized six input features (f=6) to predict fetal myocardial function in diabetic and nondiabetic mothers. These features included the fetal left ventricular myocardial performance index (MPI), the mitral valve (MV) E/A ratio, the tricuspid valve (TV) E/A ratio, right ventricular wall thickness (RVWT), left ventricular wall thickness (LVWT), and interventricular septum thickness (IVST).\n\nFeature selection was not explicitly mentioned as a separate step in the methodology. However, the decision tree algorithms used in the analysis inherently perform feature selection by identifying the most important predictors. The input features were determined based on their relevance to fetal cardiac function and were used consistently across the training and testing datasets. The training data, which constituted 70% of the total data, was used to develop the decision tree models, ensuring that the feature selection process was confined to this subset. This approach helps to prevent data leakage and maintains the integrity of the model evaluation on the test data.",
  "optimization/fitting": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/regularization": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/config": "Not applicable.",
  "model/interpretability": "The models used in this study are not black-box models. Instead, decision tree (DT) algorithms were employed, which are inherently interpretable. Three specific types of DT algorithms were utilized: classification and regression tree (CART), chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID), and quick, unbiased, efficient, statistical tree (QUEST). These algorithms provide clear, rule-based structures that can be easily understood and interpreted.\n\nFor instance, the CART model identified that all patients with a right ventricular wall thickness (RVWT) \u2265 4 mm and a myocardial performance index (MPI) \u2265 0.5 belonged to the diabetic group. This rule is straightforward and provides a clear understanding of how the model makes predictions. Similarly, the CHAID and QUEST models offer interpretable decision paths that highlight the key predictors and their interactions, making it easy to see which factors contribute most significantly to the classification of diabetic versus non-diabetic cases.\n\nThe use of these DT algorithms ensures that the decision-making process is transparent, allowing clinicians and researchers to understand the underlying logic and trust the model's predictions. This transparency is crucial for medical applications, where interpretability can significantly impact patient care and treatment decisions.",
  "model/output": "The models developed in this study are classification models. Specifically, three types of decision tree algorithms were employed: classification and regression tree (CART) algorithms, chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID), and quick, unbiased, efficient, statistical tree (QUEST). These algorithms were used to classify the target variable, which belonged to case and control groups defined by diabetes (i.e., diabetic and nondiabetic). The performance of these decision tree models was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity on the test data. The accuracy of the models is provided in an appendix. The CART model, in particular, demonstrated a high sensitivity of 97% for diabetes classification, which was superior to the other models.",

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method employed in this study involved a comprehensive analysis using decision tree (DT) algorithms to assess fetal myocardial function in diabetic and nondiabetic mothers. Three types of DT algorithms were utilized: classification and regression tree (CART) algorithms, chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID), and quick, unbiased, efficient, statistical tree (QUEST). These algorithms were chosen for their ability to handle complex datasets and provide clear, interpretable results.\n\nThe dataset was divided into two parts: 70% for training the models and 30% for testing their performance. This split ensured that the models were trained on a substantial amount of data while also having a separate dataset to evaluate their generalization capabilities.\n\nThe performance of the DT models was measured using several key metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. These metrics provided a thorough evaluation of how well the models could distinguish between diabetic and nondiabetic cases. The accuracy of the models was particularly highlighted, with the CART model achieving a sensitivity of 97% for diabetes classification, which was higher than the other models.\n\nAdditionally, the study included a confusion matrix to provide a detailed breakdown of the model's performance. This matrix showed the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, offering a clear view of the model's predictive capabilities.\n\nStatistical analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS Modeler software (version 18) and Payton software (version 1). The baseline characteristics of the participants were presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation, and the t-test was used to compare the diabetic and nondiabetic groups. A P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant, ensuring that the findings were robust and reliable.\n\nOverall, the evaluation method was rigorous and multifaceted, utilizing advanced statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms to provide a comprehensive assessment of fetal myocardial function in the context of maternal diabetes.",
  "evaluation/measure": "The performance of the decision tree models was evaluated using several key metrics to ensure a comprehensive assessment. The primary metrics reported include accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. These metrics were chosen to provide a well-rounded evaluation of the models' performance in distinguishing between diabetic and non-diabetic cases.\n\nAccuracy measures the overall correctness of the model by calculating the proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined. Sensitivity, also known as the true positive rate, indicates the model's ability to correctly identify diabetic cases. Specificity, or the true negative rate, reflects the model's capability to correctly identify non-diabetic cases.\n\nThe use of these metrics is representative of standard practices in the literature, ensuring that the evaluation is both rigorous and comparable to other studies in the field. The confusion matrix provided for the classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm further supports the reliability of these metrics by detailing the distribution of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. This detailed breakdown allows for a nuanced understanding of the model's performance across different partitions of the data, including both training and testing sets.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we employed three distinct decision tree (DT) algorithms to analyze and predict fetal myocardial function in diabetic and nondiabetic mothers. These algorithms included the classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm, chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID), and the quick, unbiased, efficient, statistical tree (QUEST) algorithm. The performance of these models was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity metrics on a test dataset comprising 30% of the total data.\n\nTo ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we divided the data into training and test sets, with 70% of the data used for model development and the remaining 30% reserved for testing. This approach allowed us to assess the generalizability and robustness of our models.\n\nWhile we did not explicitly compare our methods to publicly available benchmark datasets, the use of multiple DT algorithms provided a robust internal comparison. Each algorithm has its strengths and weaknesses, and by evaluating all three, we aimed to identify the most effective approach for our specific dataset and research questions.\n\nAdditionally, we did not perform a direct comparison to simpler baselines, such as logistic regression or naive Bayes classifiers. However, the decision tree algorithms we used are inherently simple and interpretable, making them suitable baselines in their own right. The choice of DT algorithms was driven by their ability to handle both classification and regression tasks, as well as their capacity to capture complex interactions between predictors.\n\nIn summary, our evaluation focused on internal comparisons between different DT algorithms and their performance on a dedicated test dataset. This approach allowed us to identify the most effective model for predicting fetal myocardial function in the context of maternal diabetes.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the decision tree (DT) algorithms in this study included several performance metrics, such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. These metrics were used to assess the models' ability to distinguish between diabetic and nondiabetic mothers based on fetal cardiac parameters.\n\nThe sensitivity of the classification and regression tree (CART) model was notably high, at 97%, indicating that this model was very effective in correctly identifying diabetic cases. This sensitivity was higher than that of the other models evaluated, suggesting that the CART model performed exceptionally well in this context.\n\nStatistical significance was considered with a P-value threshold of less than 0.05. For instance, the mean isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) differed significantly between mothers with poor and good glycemic control, with a P-value less than 0.05. This indicates that the observed differences were unlikely to have occurred by chance, providing confidence in the results.\n\nHowever, not all comparisons showed statistically significant differences. For example, the mean fetal left ventricular myocardial performance index (MPI) did not differ significantly between mothers with poor and good glycemic control, with a P-value of 0.12. This suggests that while there were trends observed, they were not strong enough to claim statistical significance.\n\nThe study also used confusion matrices to provide a detailed breakdown of the models' performance. For the CART model, the confusion matrix showed that the model correctly identified 34 diabetic cases and 5 healthy cases in the training partition, and 13 diabetic cases and 3 healthy cases in the testing partition. This detailed information helps in understanding the model's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nIn summary, while the study provides robust performance metrics and statistical significance for some comparisons, it is important to note that not all results reached statistical significance. The high sensitivity of the CART model is a strong indicator of its effectiveness, but further validation and larger sample sizes may be needed to confirm these findings.",
