  "dataset/provenance": "The datasets used in this study were sourced from two main locations. The primary dataset, referred to as the internal dataset, was obtained from Dartmouth Health. This dataset comprised 990 whole slide images (WSIs) and corresponding clinicopathologic data from 981 patients. The slides were digitized using Leica Aperio AT2 and CS2 scanners at 40\u00d7 magnification. After excluding patients with missing or irrelevant data, the final internal dataset consisted of 956 slides from 950 patients.\n\nThe second dataset, known as The University of Chicago (UC) dataset, included 487 digitized H&E tumor sample slides with corresponding clinicopathologic data, collected from 427 patients. This dataset was publicly available and had been used in previous studies. However, it did not contain full WSIs; instead, it included specific patches extracted from each WSI, along with their corresponding locations. This dataset was used for external validation of the models developed in this study.\n\nThe internal dataset was divided into subsets for model development and evaluation. Approximately 70% of the dataset (671 slides from 666 patients) was used as the training set, 10% (93 slides from 92 patients) as the development set, and 20% (192 slides from 192 patients) as the internal testing set. The UC dataset was used as an external test set to assess the generalizability of the approach. The slides from the same patients were kept within the same partition to prevent information leakage, and the breast cancer recurrence risk category composition was balanced across the different partitions.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into four distinct splits for model development and evaluation. The internal dataset was partitioned into three subsets: a training set, a development set, and an internal testing set. The training set consisted of 671 slides from 666 patients, which represented approximately 70% of the entire internal dataset. The development set included 93 slides from 92 patients, making up roughly 10% of the dataset. The internal testing set comprised 192 slides from 192 patients, accounting for about 20% of the dataset. The fourth split was the external test set, which utilized all the slides from the University of Chicago (UC) database. This external test set was crucial for assessing the generalizability of the approach. Care was taken to ensure that slides from the same patients were contained within the same partition to prevent information leakage. Additionally, the distribution of breast cancer recurrence risk categories was balanced across the training, development, and testing splits to maintain coherence and comparability.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets used in this study were carefully partitioned to ensure independence between training, development, and testing sets. The internal dataset, comprising 956 slides from 950 patients, was divided into three subsets. Approximately 70% of the slides, totaling 671 from 666 patients, were allocated to the training set. Around 10% of the slides, amounting to 93 from 92 patients, were designated for the development set. The remaining 20%, consisting of 192 slides from 192 patients, formed the internal testing set. This partitioning was done to maintain patient consistency within each set, ensuring that slides from the same patients were not split across different subsets. This approach prevented information leakage and maintained the integrity of the evaluation process.\n\nThe external test set consisted of all slides from the University of Chicago (UC) database, which included 487 digitized H&E tumor sample slides from 427 patients. This external set was used to assess the generalizability of the model, providing an independent evaluation of its performance.\n\nThe distribution of breast cancer recurrence risk categories was balanced across the training, development, and testing splits. This balance ensured coherence and comparability across the different partitions, aligning with best practices in machine learning to avoid bias and ensure robust model evaluation.\n\nCompared to previously published machine learning datasets, this study's approach to dataset partitioning and independence is rigorous. The emphasis on maintaining patient consistency and balancing the distribution of risk categories is designed to enhance the reliability and generalizability of the model's predictions. This methodology is crucial for developing accurate and trustworthy AI models in healthcare, where the stakes are high and the need for reliable predictions is paramount.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data used in this study is not fully available in a public forum. The internal dataset, comprising 956 slides from 950 patients, is not publicly released due to privacy and ethical considerations. The external dataset, known as The University of Chicago (UC) dataset, is publicly available but does not contain the full whole-slide images (WSIs). Instead, it includes specific patches extracted from each WSI, along with their corresponding locations. This dataset is used under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License, which permits non-commercial use, sharing, distribution, and reproduction as long as appropriate credit is given to the original authors and the source. The license does not permit sharing adapted material derived from this article or parts of it.\n\nThe use of data collected for this study was approved by the Dartmouth Health Institutional Review Board, ensuring compliance with relevant ethical regulations, including the Declaration of Helsinki. Strict confidentiality measures are in place, limiting access to essential study personnel and utilizing secure protocols. The details of these datasets are included in the publication, but the full WSIs are not publicly available to maintain patient privacy and data security. The external dataset's patches were organized into distinct regions using a clustering algorithm for model testing, but the full WSIs were not used due to their unavailability.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our study primarily involves logistic regression and a transformer-based architecture named OncoDHNet. Logistic regression is a well-established machine-learning algorithm class used for binary classification tasks, which in our case is predicting breast cancer recurrence risk categories. This algorithm was chosen for its interpretability and effectiveness in handling clinicopathologic features.\n\nOncoDHNet, on the other hand, is a novel deep-learning model that leverages recent advancements in masked pre-training techniques for analyzing whole-slide images. This model incorporates transformer architectures to analyze and reconstruct image patches, integrating both local and global histological features. The development of OncoDHNet was driven by the need to capture complex patterns in histopathological data, which traditional methods might overlook. While OncoDHNet represents a significant innovation in the field of medical imaging and deep learning, it was not published in a machine-learning journal because the primary focus of our study is on its application in breast cancer recurrence risk prediction rather than the algorithm itself. The integration of OncoDHNet with logistic regression allows for a multi-modal approach that combines the strengths of both image-based and clinicopathologic data analysis, enhancing the overall predictive accuracy and interpretability of the model.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employs a meta-predictor approach, integrating predictions from two distinct machine-learning methods to enhance performance. The first component is OncoDHNet, a transformer-based architecture designed to analyze whole-slide images (WSIs). This model leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers to capture both detailed and broader features within WSIs, focusing on histomorphological characteristics to categorize slides into low and high breast cancer recurrence risk groups.\n\nThe second component is a logistic regression model, which analyzes clinicopathologic features derived from pathology reports. This model was fine-tuned using a grid search method with 5-fold cross-validation to maximize the area under the curve (AUC) for predicting breast cancer recurrence risk categories.\n\nThe meta-predictor combines the outputs of these two models by searching for optimal threshold settings to maximize the AUC metric. This integration ensures the most effective combination of image-based predictions from OncoDHNet with clinicopathologic insights from logistic regression. The objective is to identify an optimal threshold for each model\u2019s confidence scores, evaluating various potential cut-off points to best discriminate between low and high-risk categories.\n\nThe training data for the meta-predictor is carefully partitioned to maintain independence. The internal dataset is split into training, development, and testing sets, with approximately 70% used for training, 10% for development, and 20% for testing. The external UC dataset is used solely for testing, ensuring that the models are evaluated on independent data. This partitioning strategy prevents information leakage and maintains the coherence and comparability across different partitions.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the machine-learning algorithm, the data encoding and preprocessing involved several key steps. Whole-slide images (WSIs) were divided into 224 \u00d7 224-pixel patches, which were then processed through a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a ResNet-18 architecture. This CNN extracted feature vectors capturing histopathological information such as cellular irregularities and tissue architecture. These feature vectors were subsequently passed to a pre-trained transformer model, which was designed to fill in artificially masked regions of the WSIs. This process allowed the model to capture subtle histopathological features by assessing 50 randomly selected 4480 \u00d7 4480-pixel regions from each WSI. The transformer model synthesized 'class tokens' for each region, and the average of these tokens formed a holistic representation of the slide. This representation was used to determine the final breast cancer recurrence risk category.\n\nIn addition to the image data, clinicopathologic features were encoded using a logistic regression model. These features, which included patient age, tumor size, tumor grade, histologic type, estrogen receptor (ER) status, progesterone receptor (PR) status, and HER2 status, were extracted from pathology reports. The logistic regression model was fine-tuned using a grid search method with 5-fold cross-validation on the development dataset, focusing on maximizing the area under the curve (AUC) for predicting breast cancer recurrence risk categories. This approach ensured that the model effectively integrated both image-based and clinicopathologic data for accurate predictions.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the selection of input parameters was carefully considered to ensure optimal model performance. For the logistic regression model, which analyzes clinicopathologic features, the input parameters included various demographic and clinical variables such as age, tumor grade, tumor size, ER status, PR status, and HER2 status. These features were chosen based on their known clinical significance in breast cancer prognosis.\n\nThe selection of these parameters was guided by a grid search method combined with 5-fold cross-validation on the development dataset. This approach aimed to maximize the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for predicting breast cancer recurrence risk categories. The grid search method systematically explored different combinations of hyperparameters, including regularization strengths and penalty types, to identify the optimal settings for the logistic regression model.\n\nFor the OncoDHNet model, which analyzes whole-slide images (WSIs), the input parameters involved morphological features extracted from the images. The model utilized a transformer-based architecture that combined convolutional neural network (CNN) techniques with vision transformer models. This dual approach allowed the model to capture both detailed and broader features within the WSIs. The selection of these parameters was based on previous work and was fine-tuned to optimize the model's ability to reconstruct obscured or incomplete image areas, thereby enhancing its accuracy in identifying histomorphological characteristics.\n\nThe combined model integrated predictions from both the OncoDHNet model and the logistic regression model. This integration involved searching for optimal threshold settings for each model's confidence scores to maximize the AUC metric. The process evaluated various potential cut-off points to find the one that best discriminated between low and high-risk categories. This multi-modal approach leveraged the strengths of both image-based and clinicopathologic data to improve the overall predictive accuracy of the model.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized a multi-modal approach that integrated both clinicopathologic features and morphological features from whole-slide images (WSIs). The clinicopathologic features were derived from pathology reports and included various demographic and clinical variables. These features were selected based on their established relevance in breast cancer prognosis and treatment planning.\n\nThe clinicopathologic features used in our logistic regression model included age, histologic subtype, tumor grade, tumor size, ER status, PR status, and HER2 status. Feature selection was performed to identify the most influential factors in predicting breast cancer recurrence risk categories. This selection process was conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the development and testing phases remained unbiased.\n\nFor the morphological features, we employed OncoDHNet, a transformer-based architecture designed to analyze WSIs. This model captures both detailed and broader features within the WSIs by training on image patches. The WSIs were divided into 224 \u00d7 224-pixel patches, which were processed through a CNN with a ResNet-18 architecture to extract feature vectors. These vectors were then passed to a vision transformer model to capture subtle histopathological features.\n\nThe combined model integrated predictions from both the OncoDHNet model and the logistic regression model. This approach aimed to maximize the AUC metric by identifying optimal threshold settings for each model's confidence scores. The integration process involved evaluating various potential cut-off points to find the one that best discriminates between low and high-risk categories.\n\nIn summary, the input features consisted of a combination of clinicopathologic variables and morphological features extracted from WSIs. Feature selection was performed using the training set to ensure the robustness and generalizability of our model.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed a multi-model approach that integrated both image-based and clinicopathologic features to predict breast cancer recurrence risk. The OncoDHNet model, which analyzes whole-slide images (WSIs), and the logistic regression model, which analyzes clinicopathologic features, were both optimized to prevent overfitting and underfitting.\n\nFor the OncoDHNet model, the number of parameters is indeed large due to the complexity of the convolutional neural network (CNN) and transformer architecture. To mitigate overfitting, we used a 5-fold cross-validation technique during the grid search for hyperparameter optimization. This method ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data by validating it on different subsets of the training data. Additionally, we employed regularization techniques within the CNN and transformer models to prevent overfitting. These techniques include dropout layers and weight decay, which help in reducing the model's complexity and improving its generalization capability.\n\nTo address underfitting, we ensured that the model had sufficient capacity to learn the complex patterns in the WSIs. This was achieved by using a pre-trained CNN model (ResNet-18) to extract detailed features from image patches and a transformer model to capture broader contextual features. The combination of these models allowed OncoDHNet to learn both micro-level details and macro-level patterns within the tissue samples, thereby enhancing its predictive power.\n\nFor the logistic regression model, the number of parameters is relatively small compared to the number of training points. However, to ensure that the model did not underfit, we performed a grid search with 5-fold cross-validation to optimize hyperparameters such as regularization strengths and penalty types. This process helped in finding the best combination of hyperparameters that maximized the area under the curve (AUC) for predicting breast cancer recurrence risk categories.\n\nIn summary, we used cross-validation, regularization, and careful selection of model architectures to prevent overfitting and underfitting in both the OncoDHNet and logistic regression models. These techniques ensured that our models were robust and generalizable, providing accurate predictions of breast cancer recurrence risk.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our models. For the logistic regression model, we utilized regularization methods, specifically focusing on optimizing hyperparameters such as regularization strengths and penalty types. This process involved a grid search method with 5-fold cross-validation on the development dataset, aimed at maximizing the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for predicting breast cancer recurrence risk categories. By tuning these hyperparameters, we were able to control the model's complexity and reduce the risk of overfitting.\n\nAdditionally, we integrated predictions from the OncoDHNet model, which is based on a transformer architecture, with the logistic regression model. This multi-model approach helped to mitigate overfitting by leveraging the strengths of both image-based and clinicopathologic feature analyses. The combined model was built to search for optimal threshold settings for both models, ensuring effective integration and enhancing the model's generalizability. This strategy allowed us to achieve superior performance in distinguishing between low and high breast cancer recurrence risk categories.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization schedule used in our study are detailed within the publication. Specifically, we employed a grid search method with 5-fold cross-validation on the development dataset to maximize the AUC for predicting breast cancer recurrence risk categories. This process involved fine-tuning hyperparameters such as regularization strengths and penalty types for the logistic regression model.\n\nThe model files and optimization parameters are not explicitly provided in the publication. However, the methodology and results are thoroughly described, allowing for reproducibility. The study was conducted under ethical guidelines, and the datasets used were approved by the Dartmouth Health Institutional Review Board. The data includes hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained slides and clinicopathologic data from Dartmouth Health, as well as an external validation dataset from The University of Chicago.\n\nFor those interested in replicating or building upon our work, the detailed descriptions of the models and optimization processes should serve as a comprehensive guide.

This license ensures that the methodological insights and findings can be accessed and utilized by the scientific community while maintaining the integrity of the original work.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study, OncoDHNet, is designed with a focus on interpretability, making it more transparent than typical black-box models. This transparency is achieved through the use of attention maps, which visually highlight the regions within whole-slide images (WSIs) that are critical to the model's predictive analysis. These visualizations provide pathologists with an intuitive understanding of the model\u2019s focal points, demystifying the AI\u2019s operational logic.\n\nFor instance, attention maps can identify specific tissue areas within WSIs that the model deems crucial for classifying the malignancy\u2019s nature and severity. This feature allows pathologists to confirm that the model has appropriately selected areas of invasive carcinoma, facilitating its integration into clinical workflows. Additionally, a preliminary review of these visualizations for some \"false positive\" and \"false negative\" cases identified potential confounding factors such as dense lymphocytic infiltrates, biopsy site changes, extensive ductal carcinoma in situ, or a small amount of invasive carcinoma. This transparency in AI decision-making is essential for building trust and ensuring that the model's predictions are clinically relevant.\n\nMoreover, the model's ability to highlight key regions within the WSI images enhances the transparency and confidence in the model\u2019s findings. By making the decision-making process more understandable, pathologists can better verify and refine the model's predictions, ensuring that it aligns with clinical expertise. This interpretability is crucial for the model's acceptance and integration into clinical practice, as it allows healthcare professionals to understand and trust the AI's recommendations.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in our study is primarily designed for classification tasks. Initially, it was trained to predict individual Oncotype DX breast recurrence scores, which is a regression task, achieving an R2 score of 0.42. However, the main focus of our methodology is on classifying patients into lower and higher breast cancer recurrence risk categories based on these scores. This classification is crucial for determining the appropriate treatment strategies for breast cancer patients.\n\nThe evaluation of our model's performance was conducted using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric, which is a key indicator for classification tasks. The AUC scores were calculated to assess the model's ability to distinguish between lower (Oncotype DX score below 26) and higher (Oncotype DX score of 26 or above) breast recurrence risk categories. Higher AUC values signify better performance in this classification task.\n\nIn the internal test set, the combined model, which integrates both OncoDHNet and logistic regression, achieved an AUC of 0.91. This indicates a high level of accuracy in classifying patients into the correct risk categories. Similarly, in the external UC test set, the combined model demonstrated an AUC of 0.84, further validating its effectiveness in classification.\n\nThe model's performance was also evaluated by tumor grade, showing consistent results across different grades. For instance, in the internal testing cohort, the combined model achieved AUCs of 0.95 for Grade 1, 0.89 for Grade 2, and 0.86 for Grade 3. These results highlight the model's capability to evaluate recurrence risk, particularly in Grade 2 tumors, where the distinction is typically more complex.\n\nOverall, the model's output is focused on classifying patients into low- and high-risk categories for breast cancer recurrence, providing valuable insights for clinical decision-making. The integration of both histopathological and clinicopathologic features enhances the model's accuracy and robustness, making it a reliable tool for predicting breast cancer recurrence risk.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "The underlying code for this study and internal training/validation/testing datasets is not publicly available. However, it may be made available to qualified researchers upon reasonable request from the corresponding author. This approach ensures that the code can be reviewed and potentially replicated by other researchers while maintaining control over its distribution.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of our methodology involved a comprehensive assessment using both internal and external datasets. The trained model was evaluated on a held-out test set consisting of 198 patients from our internal dataset and an additional 418 patients from the external UC dataset. The primary evaluation metric used was the Area Under the Curve (AUC), which is a key indicator of the model's ability to distinguish between lower and higher breast cancer recurrence risk categories.\n\nTo ensure the robustness of our results, we calculated the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the bootstrap resampling technique with 10,000 iterations. This approach provided a reliable estimate of the model's performance variability.\n\nThe internal test set included 192 slides from 192 patients, while the external cohort comprised 460 slides from 405 patients, all of whom were ER+/HER2\u2212 breast cancer patients. The AUC scores were calculated on a per-patient basis by averaging the scores across multiple whole-slide images (WSIs) when available for each patient.\n\nOur model, OncoDHNet, achieved an AUC score of 0.87 for the classification of low- and high-breast cancer recurrence risk categories on the internal test set. Additionally, a logistic regression model trained on clinicopathologic features performed notably, with an AUC of 0.83. The combined model, which integrates OncoDHNet's image-based approach with clinicopathologic insights, demonstrated superior performance with an AUC of 0.91. This highlights the advantage of a multi-modal analytic approach in predicting low- and high-risk categories for breast cancer recurrence.\n\nWithin the external UC test set, OncoDHNet and the logistic regression model achieved AUC scores of 0.83 and 0.79, respectively. The combined model again showed superior performance, with an AUC of 0.84. These results underscore the generalizability and effectiveness of our approach across different datasets.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we primarily focused on the Area Under the Curve (AUC) as the key performance metric for evaluating the effectiveness of our models in classifying breast cancer recurrence risk categories. The AUC is a widely recognized metric in the field of machine learning and medical diagnostics, as it provides a comprehensive measure of a model's ability to distinguish between different classes. Specifically, we used the AUC to assess how well our models could differentiate between lower (Oncotype DX score below 26) and higher (Oncotype DX score 26 or above) breast recurrence risk categories.\n\nTo ensure the robustness of our AUC estimates, we calculated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the bootstrap resampling technique with 10,000 iterations. This method helps to provide a range within which the true AUC value is likely to fall, giving us a better understanding of the model's performance variability.\n\nIn addition to the AUC, we also reported the R2 score for the initial phase of our model, where we trained it to predict the individual Oncotype DX breast recurrence score for each slide. The R2 score indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. An R2 score of 0.42 was achieved, which, while not exceptionally high, demonstrates a moderate level of predictive accuracy for the continuous score.\n\nThe choice of AUC as our primary metric is representative of current practices in the literature, where AUC is commonly used to evaluate the performance of classification models, particularly in medical diagnostics. This metric allows for a clear and concise comparison of our model's performance against other studies and benchmarks in the field. The inclusion of confidence intervals further enhances the transparency and reliability of our reported results, making them more comparable to other rigorous studies.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we compared the performance of our proposed methodology against simpler baselines to evaluate its effectiveness. Specifically, we assessed the performance of a logistic regression model trained on clinicopathologic features. This model served as a baseline to highlight the additional value provided by our more complex approach.\n\nThe logistic regression model was trained on seven key clinicopathologic features, including tumor grade, PR status, tumor size, patient age, and histologic types. These features were selected based on their established clinical significance in predicting breast cancer recurrence risk. The model's performance was evaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric, which measures its ability to distinguish between lower and higher breast recurrence risk categories.\n\nIn addition to the logistic regression model, we also developed OncoDHNet, a transformer-based architecture designed to analyze whole-slide images (WSIs). OncoDHNet combines convolutional neural network (CNN) techniques with vision transformers to capture both detailed and broader features within WSIs. This model was trained to reconstruct obscured or incomplete image areas, enabling it to identify important histomorphological characteristics for categorizing WSIs into low and high breast cancer recurrence risk groups.\n\nThe combined model, which integrates predictions from both OncoDHNet and the logistic regression model, demonstrated superior performance compared to either model alone. This multi-modal approach leverages the strengths of both image-based and clinicopathologic feature analysis, providing a more robust and nuanced prediction of breast cancer recurrence risk.\n\nOur evaluation included both an internal test set of 198 patients and an external UC dataset of 418 patients. The combined model achieved an AUC of 0.91 on the internal test set and 0.84 on the external UC test set, outperforming both the logistic regression model and OncoDHNet alone. These results highlight the advantage of a multi-modal analytic approach in predicting low- and high-risk categories for breast cancer recurrence.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our methodology included the calculation of 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the key performance metric, the Area Under the Curve (AUC). These CIs were determined using the bootstrap resampling technique with 10,000 iterations, providing a robust measure of the variability and reliability of our AUC scores.\n\nThe AUC score is crucial for assessing the model's ability to distinguish between lower and higher breast recurrence risk categories. A higher AUC value indicates better performance. The confidence intervals for the AUC scores were reported for both the internal and external test sets, ensuring that the performance metrics are statistically significant.\n\nFor the internal test set, the OncoDHNet model achieved an AUC of 0.87 with a 95% CI of 0.81\u20130.92, while the logistic regression model had an AUC of 0.83 with a 95% CI of 0.75\u20130.91. The combined model, integrating both approaches, demonstrated superior performance with an AUC of 0.91.\n\nIn the external UC test set, OncoDHNet and the logistic regression model achieved AUC scores of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.77\u20130.89) and 0.79 (95% CI: 0.73\u20130.85), respectively. Again, the combined model outperformed both individual models with an AUC of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.78\u20130.90).\n\nThese confidence intervals indicate that the results are statistically significant, supporting the claim that the combined model is superior to the individual models and baselines. The narrow ranges of the CIs further reinforce the reliability and generalizability of our findings.",
  "evaluation/availability": "The raw evaluation files, specifically the whole slide images (WSIs), are not publicly available in the external dataset used for evaluation. Instead, the external dataset, known as The University of Chicago (UC) dataset, includes only specific patches extracted from each WSI, along with their corresponding locations. These patches were used to evaluate the model's performance. The dataset does not contain the full WSIs, which would provide a more comprehensive view of the tissue samples. The use of patches limits the model to the information contained within those smaller extracted regions, potentially missing subtle indicators of cancer severity or small regions of aggressive disease that might fall outside the selected patches.
