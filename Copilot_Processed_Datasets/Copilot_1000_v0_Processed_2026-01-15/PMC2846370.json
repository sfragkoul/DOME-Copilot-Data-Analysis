  "dataset/provenance": "The datasets used in our study are primarily sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which is a well-known collection of databases for the machine learning community. These datasets are widely used for benchmarking and evaluating machine learning algorithms.\n\nThe number of data points varies across different datasets. For instance, the \"Primary-tumor\" dataset has 836 data points, while the \"Segment\" dataset contains 1183 data points. Other datasets, such as \"Soybean\" and \"Waveform-5000,\" have 1900 and 1203 data points, respectively. The specific number of data points for each dataset is provided in the tables within our publication.\n\nThese datasets have been utilized in previous research and by the community for various machine learning tasks. They serve as standard benchmarks for comparing the performance of different classifiers and algorithms. The datasets cover a wide range of domains, including medical diagnosis, image recognition, and text classification, among others. This diversity allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the classifiers' performance across different types of data.",
  "dataset/splits": "In our study, we utilized various datasets to evaluate the performance of different classifiers. Each dataset was divided into multiple splits to assess the classifiers' accuracy and robustness. The datasets included in our analysis encompassed a wide range of domains, such as medical, biological, and general classification tasks.\n\nFor each dataset, we typically employed three main splits: Primary-tumor, Segment, and Sick. These splits were used to train and test the classifiers under different conditions. The Primary-tumor split contained a substantial number of data points, with error sizes ranging from approximately 49.85 to 52.51. The Segment split had a smaller error size, around 10.91 to 11.86, and included a moderate number of data points. The Sick split had the fewest data points, with error sizes around 2.17 to 4.51.\n\nIn addition to these primary splits, we also considered other splits such as Sonar, Soybean, Splice, Vehicle, Vote, Vowel, Waveform-5000, and Zoo. These splits provided further insights into the classifiers' performance across different types of data. For instance, the Sonar split had a very low error size of around 0.48 to 0.96, indicating high accuracy. The Soybean and Splice splits had moderate error sizes, while the Vehicle and Vowel splits had higher error sizes, suggesting more challenging classification tasks.\n\nThe distribution of data points in each split varied significantly. Some splits, like the Primary-tumor and Vowel, had a large number of data points, while others, like the Sick and Vote, had fewer data points. This variation allowed us to evaluate the classifiers' performance under different data availability scenarios.\n\nOverall, the multiple splits and their varying sizes and error rates provided a comprehensive assessment of the classifiers' accuracy and robustness across different datasets and conditions.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm discussed in this publication is centered around the development and application of AVT-NBL, a novel machine-learning algorithm. AVT-NBL stands for Attribute Value Taxonomy-based Na\u00efve Bayes Learner. This algorithm is designed to learn classifiers from attribute value taxonomies (AVT) and data, where different instances may have attribute values specified at different levels of abstraction.\n\nAVT-NBL is indeed a new machine-learning algorithm. It represents a generalization of the standard algorithm for learning na\u00efve Bayes classifiers. The standard na\u00efve Bayes learner (NBL) can be viewed as a special case of AVT-NBL by collapsing a multilevel AVT associated with each attribute into a corresponding single-level AVT whose leaves correspond to the primitive values of the attribute.\n\nThe reason this algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is not explicitly stated. However, it is worth noting that the focus of this publication is on knowledge discovery and data mining, particularly in scientific applications. The algorithm's development and evaluation are presented within the context of these applications, which may explain its publication venue.\n\nAVT-NBL has shown promising results in experimental evaluations. It is able to learn substantially compact and more accurate classifiers on a broad range of data sets compared to those produced by standard NBL and Prop-NBL. Additionally, AVT-NBL is more efficient in its use of training data, producing classifiers that outperform those produced by NBL using substantially fewer training examples. This makes AVT-NBL an effective approach to learning compact, accurate classifiers from data, including data that are partially specified.",
  "optimization/meta": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, data encoding and preprocessing were crucial steps to facilitate the application of our machine-learning algorithms, particularly the AVT-NBL. For datasets containing numerical attributes, we discretized each attribute into a maximum of 10 bins. This discretization process transformed continuous numerical values into categorical intervals, making it easier to apply attribute value taxonomies (AVTs).\n\nFor datasets with nominal attributes, we utilized AVTs to structure the attribute values hierarchically. These taxonomies were either provided by domain experts or generated using a hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm called AVT-Learner. The AVTs helped in handling partially specified data by allowing attribute values to be specified at different levels of precision.\n\nThe preprocessing step involved propositionalizing the data using the AVTs. This process converted the hierarchical attribute values into a set of Boolean features. For example, if an attribute value fell within a certain interval or category in the AVT, the corresponding Boolean attribute was set to True; otherwise, it was set to False. This transformation increased the number of attributes in the dataset but enabled the exploitation of the hierarchical relationships within the data.\n\nIt is important to note that the Boolean features created through propositionalization are not independent given the class. This dependency arises because a Boolean attribute corresponding to a node in an AVT is correlated with its descendant and ancestor nodes. This correlation is leveraged to exploit the information provided by the AVTs in learning from partially specified data.\n\nHowever, this dependency can degrade the performance of classifiers that rely on the independence of attributes given the class, such as the na\u00efve Bayes classifier. To address this, we experimentally compared the performance of AVT-NBL with Prop-NBL and the standard na\u00efve Bayes algorithm (NBL). Our experiments were designed to explore the effectiveness of AVT-NBL in handling partially specified data and its robustness in learning accurate and comprehensible classifiers.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the number of parameters used in the model, denoted as size(h), corresponds to the total number of class conditional probabilities required to describe the na\u00efve Bayes classifier. This is because each attribute is assumed to be independent of the others given the class.\n\nThe selection of these parameters is efficiently handled by the algorithm designed to search for the AVT-based na\u00efve Bayes classifier. This algorithm optimizes the criterion independently for each attribute, resulting in a hypothesis that balances the complexity of the classifier (in terms of the number of parameters) against the accuracy of classification. The algorithm terminates when no candidate refinements of the classifier yield statistically significant improvement in the CMDL score. This process ensures that the model is both compact and accurate, trading off complexity against error effectively.",
  "optimization/features": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we addressed the challenge of fitting classifiers to data using the AVT-NBL algorithm, which is designed to handle attribute value taxonomies and partially specified data. The number of parameters in our model can indeed be larger than the number of training points, especially when dealing with complex datasets and attribute value taxonomies.\n\nTo mitigate overfitting, we employed several strategies. Firstly, the AVT-NBL algorithm inherently performs a form of regularization by exploiting the hierarchical structure of attribute value taxonomies. This allows for the automatic shrinkage of parameters, which helps in estimating relevant statistics with adequate confidence even from small samples. Secondly, we conducted extensive cross-validation experiments, including 10-fold cross-validation and multiple random partitions of data into training and test pools. This rigorous validation process ensured that our classifiers generalized well to unseen data, thereby minimizing overfitting.\n\nConversely, to avoid underfitting, we ensured that our model was sufficiently complex to capture the underlying patterns in the data. The AVT-NBL algorithm's ability to learn from partially specified data and its use of abstract attribute values allowed for the creation of more accurate and robust classifiers. Additionally, we compared the performance of AVT-NBL with other algorithms, such as NBL and Prop-NBL, on various benchmark datasets. The results consistently showed that AVT-NBL yielded lower error rates and more compact classifiers, indicating that it effectively balanced model complexity and generalization performance.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our work, we have addressed the issue of overfitting, which is a common challenge when learning from relatively small datasets. To mitigate this, we have incorporated a form of regularization into our learning algorithms. Specifically, our approach exploits attribute value taxonomies (AVT) to perform automatic shrinkage. This technique helps in estimating the relevant statistics with adequate confidence, thereby yielding robust classifiers. By leveraging AVT, our algorithms can automatically reduce the complexity of the model, which in turn minimizes overfitting. This method is particularly beneficial in scenarios where the data is partially specified or comes from semantically heterogeneous sources, ensuring that the classifiers remain accurate and generalizable.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations, optimization schedule, model files, and optimization parameters are not explicitly detailed in the provided information. However, the publication does include extensive results from various datasets, showcasing the performance of different classifiers. These results are presented in tables, which compare error rates and classifier sizes across multiple datasets using methods like NBL, Prop-NBL, and AVT-NBL. The error rates are estimated using 10-fold cross-validation, and confidence intervals are provided for the error rates.\n\nThe publication also discusses the calculation of the CMDL score for na\u00efve Bayes classifiers, which involves trade-offs between classifier complexity and classification accuracy. This suggests a structured approach to optimization, although specific details about the hyper-parameter configurations and optimization schedules are not outlined.\n\nFor those interested in replicating or building upon the work, the publication is available in PMC, indicating that it is accessible to the public. However, specific model files or detailed optimization parameters are not directly mentioned as being available for download or use under a particular license.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model presented in this publication, AVT-NBL, is designed to be highly interpretable and transparent, rather than a black-box model. This transparency is achieved through the use of attribute value taxonomies (AVTs), which allow the model to learn classification rules that are expressed in terms of abstract attribute values. These abstract values lead to simpler, more accurate, and easier-to-comprehend rules that are expressed using familiar, hierarchically related concepts.\n\nFor example, consider an AVT for student status, where \"Undergraduate\" is an abstract value that encompasses more specific values like \"Freshman,\" \"Sophomore,\" \"Junior,\" and \"Senior.\" The model can use these abstract values to create rules that are more general and intuitive, such as \"If student status is Undergraduate, then the likelihood of event X is high.\" This makes the model's decisions more understandable to humans, as they can trace the reasoning back to familiar concepts.\n\nAdditionally, the use of AVTs allows the model to handle partially specified data, where attribute values may be specified at different levels of precision. This flexibility further enhances the model's interpretability, as it can accommodate the nuances and uncertainties present in real-world data.\n\nIn summary, AVT-NBL is a transparent model that leverages AVTs to create interpretable classification rules. This transparency is a key advantage of the model, as it enables users to understand and trust the model's decisions.",
  "model/output": "The model discussed in this subsection is a classification model. Specifically, it involves the development and evaluation of na\u00efve Bayes classifiers, which are used for classification tasks. The output of these models is the error rate and the size of the classifiers generated by different methods, such as NBL, PROP-NBL, and AVT-NBL. These classifiers are evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation on various benchmark datasets, with the error rates presented along with their 90% confidence intervals. The size of the classifiers varies depending on the method used, with AVT-NBL showing an average size across the cross-validation experiments. The goal is to trade off the complexity of the classifier, in terms of the number of parameters, against the accuracy of classification. The algorithm terminates when no further statistically significant improvements in the CMDL score are achieved.",

  "evaluation/method": "In our evaluation, we employed several rigorous methods to assess the performance of the classifiers generated by AVT-NBL, NBL, and Prop-NBL. Primarily, we used 10-fold cross-validation to estimate error rates and classifier sizes. This approach involved dividing each dataset into 10 subsets, training the classifiers on 9 subsets, and testing on the remaining subset, repeating this process 10 times with different subsets as the test set.\n\nAdditionally, we calculated 90% confidence intervals for the error rates to provide a measure of the variability and reliability of our results. This statistical method ensures that the reported error rates are robust and not due to random chance.\n\nFor datasets with partially or totally missing values, we compared the error rates of the classifiers across different percentages of missing data (10%, 30%, and 50%). This allowed us to evaluate how well each method handles incomplete data, which is a common challenge in real-world applications.\n\nWe also conducted experiments to investigate the performance of the classifiers as a function of training-set size. We divided each dataset into a training pool and a test pool, then sampled training sets of varying sizes (from 10% to 100% of the training pool) to train the classifiers. The resulting classifiers were evaluated on the entire test pool, and this process was repeated multiple times to ensure the stability and generalizability of the results.\n\nFurthermore, we compared the total number of class conditional probabilities needed to specify the classifiers produced by each method. This comparison highlighted the compactness and efficiency of the AVT-NBL classifiers, which are crucial for practical applications where computational resources are limited.\n\nOverall, our evaluation methods were designed to provide a comprehensive and thorough assessment of the classifiers' performance, robustness, and efficiency.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our evaluation, we primarily focused on two key performance metrics to assess the effectiveness of our classifiers: error rates and classifier size. The error rates were estimated using 10-fold cross-validation, providing a robust measure of the classifiers' accuracy across different datasets. Additionally, we calculated 90% confidence intervals for these error rates to ensure the reliability of our results.\n\nThe size of the classifiers, measured by the number of class conditional probabilities, was also a crucial metric. This allowed us to compare the compactness of the classifiers generated by different methods. Our results showed that the AVT-NBL method consistently produced classifiers that were not only more accurate but also more compact than those generated by NBL and PROP-NBL.\n\nThese metrics are representative of standard practices in the literature, where error rates and model complexity are commonly used to evaluate classifier performance. By reporting both accuracy and size, we provide a comprehensive view of the trade-offs between performance and efficiency, which is essential for practical applications.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our evaluation, we conducted a comprehensive comparison of our proposed method, AVT-NBL, against two other methods: NBL and PROP-NBL. This comparison was performed on a diverse set of 37 UCI benchmark datasets, ensuring a robust assessment across various types of data. The error rates and classifier sizes were estimated using 10-fold cross-validation, providing a reliable measure of performance.\n\nFor the original, fully specified data, AVT-NBL demonstrated substantially lower error rates compared to both NBL and PROP-NBL. This indicates that AVT-NBL is more effective in handling the complexities of the data, leading to more accurate classifiers. Additionally, AVT-NBL produced classifiers that were significantly more compact than those generated by PROP-NBL and NBL, highlighting its efficiency in exploiting the information supplied by the AVT.\n\nWe also evaluated the performance of these methods on data with partially or totally missing values. AVT-NBL consistently yielded lower error rates than NBL and PROP-NBL, with the differences becoming more pronounced as the percentage of missing attribute values increased. This suggests that AVT-NBL is particularly robust in handling incomplete data, a common challenge in real-world applications.\n\nFurthermore, we investigated the performance of the classifiers as a function of training set size. AVT-NBL was found to be more efficient in its use of training data, producing more accurate classifiers for a given training set size compared to NBL and PROP-NBL. This efficiency was demonstrated across multiple benchmark datasets, including Audiology data.\n\nIn summary, our evaluation shows that AVT-NBL outperforms both NBL and PROP-NBL in terms of error rates, classifier compactness, and robustness to missing data. These results underscore the effectiveness of AVT-NBL as a superior method for generating accurate and efficient classifiers.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "In our evaluation, we employed 10-fold cross-validation to estimate the error rates and sizes of the classifiers generated by our methods. To ensure the reliability of our results, we calculated 90% confidence intervals for the error rates. This statistical measure provides a range within which the true error rate is expected to lie with 90% confidence, allowing us to assess the precision of our estimates.\n\nThe confidence intervals are reported alongside the error rates in our tables, enabling a clear understanding of the variability and reliability of the results. For instance, in Table 2, which compares the error rates and sizes of classifiers generated by NBL, PROP-NBL, and AVT-NBL on 37 UCI benchmark datasets, each error rate is accompanied by a confidence interval. This approach ensures that the differences in error rates between the methods are statistically significant and not merely due to random variation.\n\nFurthermore, we conducted additional experiments to investigate the performance of our classifiers as a function of the training-set size. These experiments involved sampling training sets of different sizes and evaluating the resulting classifiers on a test pool. The process was repeated multiple times to ensure robustness, and the accuracy of the classifiers was averaged across these runs. This comprehensive evaluation strategy reinforces the statistical significance of our findings, demonstrating that AVT-NBL consistently yields lower error rates and more compact classifiers compared to NBL and PROP-NBL.",
  "evaluation/availability": "The raw evaluation files are not publicly available. The evaluation results presented in the publication were derived from specific datasets and methodologies applied during the research process. These datasets include various benchmark data from the UCI repository, and the error rates and classifier sizes were estimated using 10-fold cross-validation. The results are reported in tables within the publication, but the raw data files used for these evaluations are not provided for public access. Therefore, readers interested in replicating or building upon these findings would need to refer to the described datasets and methods outlined in the study."
