  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset was sourced from three state-of-the-art anaerobic digesters located in Hungary. Two of these digesters are situated in Szeged, labeled as MWBP and SZBP, while the third is in Kecskem\u00e9t, labeled as KBP. These biogas plants were selected based on specific criteria: they have been operational for over five years without issues and utilize distinct biopolymers as the primary substrate for biogas production. Sampling was conducted at seasonal intervals over a one-year period, specifically in October 2020, January 2021, April 2021, and July 2021. Each sampling event yielded three biological replicates, resulting in a total of twelve samples per biogas plant. This comprehensive sampling strategy ensured a robust dataset for analyzing the microbial communities and their activities within these industrial-scale biogas reactors.\n\nThe dataset includes measurements of various anaerobic digestion (AD) chemical parameters, such as sludge pH, carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N), total solid (TS) content, volatile solid (VS) content, total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), volatile organic acid (VOA) content, and total inorganic carbon (TIC). These measurements were taken following previously published methods, ensuring consistency and reliability. Additionally, biochemical methane potential (BMP) batch tests were performed using 160 mL reactor vessels containing 60 mL of liquid phase. The inoculum to substrate ratio was set according to the VDI 4630 standard, with detailed gas sampling and measurement procedures documented in earlier publications.\n\nThe dataset also encompasses metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing data. Total DNA and RNA were purified from 2 mL aliquots of each sample, with extractions performed in triplicate and pooled together. The sequencing was conducted using the Illumina platform, following manufacturer recommendations. Pooled genomic DNA samples were used to construct libraries with the NEBNext Ultra II Library Prep Kit, and paired-end metagenomics sequencing was performed on a NextSeq 550 sequencer. Similarly, metatranscriptome sequencing from pooled RNA samples was carried out using the Zymo-Seq RiboFree Total RNA Library Kit, with paired-end mRNA sequencing on the same NextSeq 550 sequencer. Primary data analysis was performed using the \"bcl2fastq\" software.\n\nThe dataset has been utilized in previous studies and by the community to explore the structure and function of microbiomes in biogas reactors. It has provided insights into the interactions between Bacteroides, Firmicutes, and hydrogenotrophic methanogens, as well as the influence of ammonia concentration on the methanogen community. The dataset's comprehensive nature and adherence to established protocols make it a valuable resource for further research in the field of anaerobic digestion and biogas production.",

The raw sequencing data, including metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequences, were processed and analyzed using specific tools and pipelines as described in the methods section. The specific datasets used for training and testing machine learning models, as well as the parameters for data splitting, are detailed within the publication. However, the actual datasets themselves are not released in a public forum. Access to the data would require direct communication with the authors or relevant institutions, subject to any confidentiality agreements or data sharing policies that may apply. The study adheres to ethical guidelines and regulatory requirements for data handling and sharing, ensuring that sensitive information is protected.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our study leverages a machine-learning approach that is relatively new in the field of metagenomics. Specifically, we utilized Semibin, a software package that combines a semi-supervised learning method with deep Siamese neural networks. This advanced co-assembly binning workflow is designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of genome reconstruction from complex metagenomic data.\n\nThe decision to use this particular algorithm was driven by its demonstrated effectiveness in handling the intricacies of metagenomic datasets, particularly in the context of anaerobic biogas-producing communities. The semi-supervised approach allows for the integration of prior knowledge, which is crucial for improving the binning performance in environments with high microbial diversity.\n\nWhile the algorithm itself is innovative and has shown significant promise in metagenomic studies, it was not published in a machine-learning journal primarily because its development and application were tailored specifically for bioinformatics and metagenomics. The focus of our work was on the biological insights gained from the application of this algorithm rather than the algorithm's development per se. Therefore, the publication was more aligned with journals that emphasize microbial ecology and bioinformatics, where the practical implications and biological findings are of primary interest.",
  "optimization/meta": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure high-quality input for the models. Initially, raw sequences were filtered using fastp to remove low-quality reads, with a minimum length requirement of 150 base pairs. This filtering step was crucial for maintaining the integrity of the subsequent analyses.\n\nFollowing filtering, the sequences were checked with FastQC to assess their quality. The filtered sequences were then co-assembled using Megahit, a tool designed for efficient and accurate assembly of metagenomic data. The assembly process was performed separately for each biogas plant, with specific settings to optimize contig length and k-mer sizes.\n\nFor metagenome binning, the contig database was created using Anvi\u2019o, which facilitated the genome-centric metagenomics workflow. The binning procedure was performed using Semibin, a machine-learning-guided software that combines semi-supervised approaches with deep Siamese neural networks. This method has been shown to enhance the binning process for complex microbiomes, outperforming traditional unsupervised methods.\n\nThe dereplication and quality filtration of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were conducted using dRep and CheckM2. These tools ensured that the MAGs were of high quality, with minimal contamination and high completeness. The resulting non-redundant MAGs were then used for further analysis.\n\nAdditionally, the MarkerMAG program was employed to detect, assemble, and link 16S rRNA genes from metagenomes to MAGs. This step was essential for studying the genomics and phylogeny of uncultivated microorganisms, as ribosomal RNA genes are frequently absent from MAGs recovered from short-read sequencing data.\n\nOverall, the data encoding and preprocessing involved rigorous filtering, assembly, binning, and quality control steps to ensure that the input data for the machine-learning algorithm was of the highest quality. This meticulous approach enabled accurate and reliable analysis of the microbial communities in the biogas reactors.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized several key parameters to optimize and analyze our data. For the correlation analysis, we employed the trans_env function with specific parameters: use_data was set to species, cor_method was set to Pearson, and p_adjust_method was set to false discovery rate (fdr). These settings were chosen to effectively reveal correlations between microorganisms and chemical parameters.\n\nFor the differential gene expression and enrichment analysis, we used the DESeq2 package with its default parameters. This package is widely recognized for its robustness in handling count data from high-throughput sequencing assays.\n\nAdditionally, for the metagenome assembly and binning process, we used specific parameters in various tools. For instance, in Megahit, we set the minimum contig length to 1500 bp and the k-mer sizes ranging from 21 to 141. These settings were chosen to ensure high-quality assembly of the metagenomic data.\n\nIn the Salmon quant files, we imported the data into R using tximport with the settings type set to salmon and txOut set to TRUE. This allowed us to filter the counts to retain genes with a minimum of 5 reads across 4 samples, which was crucial for normalizing the data using DESeq2.\n\nFor visualizing significantly different genes, we used ggplot2 with specific thresholds: log2 fold change (FC) was set to \u22652.0 and p-value was set to \u22640.05. These thresholds were chosen to identify genes that showed substantial differential expression.\n\nOverall, the selection of these parameters was based on established best practices and the specific requirements of our datasets to ensure accurate and reliable results.",
  "optimization/features": "The study utilized a variety of input features derived from metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses, as well as chemical parameters measured from anaerobic digesters. The specific number of features (f) is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that a comprehensive set of features was used, including microbial composition, gene expression data, and chemical parameters such as volatile organic acids (VOAs), total inorganic carbon (TIC), total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C/N), total solids (TS), and volatile solids (VS).\n\nFeature selection was implicitly performed through the use of specific analytical methods and tools. For instance, the DESeq2 package was used for differential gene expression and enrichment analysis, which inherently involves selecting significant genes based on criteria such as log2 fold change (log2 FC: \u22652.0) and p-value (p \u2264 0.05). Additionally, the trans_env function with Pearson correlation and false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment was employed to reveal correlations between microorganisms and chemical parameters, further refining the set of relevant features.\n\nThe feature selection process was conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the models were trained on a robust and relevant subset of features. This approach helps in avoiding overfitting and ensures that the models generalize well to new, unseen data. The use of tools like DESeq2 and the trans_env function, along with statistical methods such as ANOVA and PERMANOVA, ensures that the selected features are both significant and relevant to the study's objectives.",

One key approach was the use of semi-supervised binning complemented with machine learning. This method has been shown to enhance the metagenome binning process for complex microbiomes, outperforming existing unsupervised nucleotide composition and abundance-based methods. By integrating machine learning, we were able to improve the accuracy and reliability of our genome reconstructions, reducing the likelihood of overfitting to specific datasets.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized dereplication and quality filtration steps for the metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). This involved using tools like dRep and CheckM2 to ensure that our MAGs were of high quality and free from contamination. These steps helped in maintaining the integrity of our data and preventing overfitting by ensuring that our analyses were based on reliable and representative genomic information.\n\nFurthermore, we performed statistical analyses using packages like DESeq2 and microeco, which include built-in methods for adjusting p-values and controlling for false discoveries. These statistical controls are crucial for preventing overfitting and ensuring that our findings are statistically significant and not due to random chance.\n\nOverall, our approach combined advanced machine learning techniques with rigorous quality control and statistical validation to minimize the risk of overfitting and ensure the reliability of our results.",

It is transparent and interpretable, allowing for a clear understanding of the relationships and interactions within the microbial communities analyzed.\n\nThe study utilized machine learning-guided genome-centric metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, which provided detailed insights into the microbial composition and metabolic activities. This approach enabled the identification of high-quality, non-redundant metagenome-assembled genomes (nrMAGs) and the elucidation of the relationships between abundant core methanogenic communities and their syntrophic bacterial partners.\n\nFor instance, the study identified specific clusters of microorganisms that showed widespread interactions. Clusters I and IV, which included microorganisms like UBA1179_sp002340405 and Fermentimonas sp019136875, demonstrated positive associations with various methanogens such as Methanoculleus bourgensis and Methanobacterium sp012838205. These interactions were visualized using tools like ggplot2 and the ggraph package, which allowed for the clear depiction of correlations and co-occurrences.\n\nAdditionally, the study employed statistical analyses such as multidimensional scaling (MDS) plots and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) to visualize and assess the significance of differences between microbial communities. These methods provided transparent and interpretable results, showing how different chemical parameters and microbial activities were correlated.\n\nThe use of tools like NetComi for network construction and comparison further enhanced the interpretability of the model. By calculating and normalizing the association matrix, the study could reveal intricate correlations between microorganisms and chemical parameters, providing a comprehensive understanding of the microbial interactions within the biogas reactors.\n\nOverall, the transparency of the model allowed for a detailed and interpretable analysis of the microbial communities, shedding light on the complex interactions and metabolic activities within the biogas production process.",
  "model/output": "The model discussed in the publication is not a traditional classification or regression model. Instead, it involves a combination of bioinformatic and statistical analyses to study microbial communities in biogas reactors. The primary focus is on metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses, which involve sequencing and analyzing the genetic material of microbial communities to understand their composition and activity.\n\nSeveral tools and packages were employed for different aspects of the analysis. For instance, the `ggraph` package was used to visualize correlations, particularly between microorganisms and chemical parameters. The `trans_env` function within this package utilized Pearson correlation and false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment to reveal these correlations.\n\nThe `DESeq2` package was used for differential gene expression and enrichment analysis. This package is commonly used for analyzing count data from high-throughput sequencing assays, such as RNA-seq, and it helps in identifying genes that are differentially expressed under different conditions.\n\nThe `tximport` package was used to import Salmon quantification files into R. Salmon is a tool for transcript-level quantification from RNA-seq data, and `tximport` facilitates the integration of these quantifications into downstream analyses.\n\nVisualizations were created using `ggplot2` and `Circos` for metagenomics and metatranscriptomics analyses of carbohydrate-active enzymes. These visualizations help in understanding the distribution and activity of these enzymes within the microbial communities.\n\nStatistical analyses included multidimensional scaling (MDS) plots to display Bray-Curtis dissimilarities, and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) to assess differences among samples. The `microViz` and `microeco` packages were used for these analyses.\n\nIn summary, the model involves a suite of bioinformatic and statistical tools to analyze and visualize the genetic and functional diversity of microbial communities in biogas reactors. The focus is on understanding the relationships between microbial composition, activity, and environmental parameters.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time for the model varied depending on the specific tasks performed. For metagenome assembly and binning, the process involved filtering raw sequences using fastp and checking them with FastQC, which are relatively quick steps. The co-assembly of filtered sequences using Megahit for each biogas plant (BP) took several hours, depending on the size of the dataset. Genome reconstruction with Semibin, a machine-learning-guided software, was more time-consuming, often taking multiple days due to the complexity of the semi-supervised approach and the deep Siamese neural networks involved. Dereplication and quality filtration of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) using dRep and CheckM2 also required significant computational time, typically spanning several hours to a full day. The overall workflow, from sequencing to the final analysis, spanned several weeks, considering the iterative nature of the processes and the need for multiple quality checks and validations.",

For metagenome assembly and binning, raw sequences were filtered and checked using fastp and FastQC, respectively. The filtered sequences were then co-assembled using Megahit, with specific settings for minimum contig length and k-mer sizes. The metagenomics binning procedure was performed separately for each anaerobic digestion (AD) metagenomics dataset until the dereplication step. Anvi\u2019o was used to create the contig database for the subsequent metagenomics workflow.\n\nGenome reconstruction was carried out using Semibin, a machine-learning-guided software package that combines a semi-supervised approach with deep Siamese neural networks. This method has been shown to enhance the metagenome binning process for complex microbiomes. For dereplication and quality filtration of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), dRep and CheckM2 were utilized with specific parameters to ensure high-quality MAGs.\n\nThe statistical analysis involved visualizing BMP test results using ggplot2 and calculating significant differences between maximum biogas potentials using the ggsignif package. Multidimensional scaling of samples and MAG abundance were visualized using microViz. Euclidean distances and differences among samples were calculated using permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and visualized with the microeco R package. To assess the significance of differences between MAGs, the lefser package was used inside microeco, with a significance threshold of p \u2264 0.05.\n\nThe core microbiome was identified by analyzing the occurrence data, considering a taxon observed in 83.3% of samples with an abundance greater than 1 (~10x genome coverage) as a member of the core microbiome. The distribution of the core microbiome at the species and phylum levels was visualized using the ggvenn and ggtern packages. Co-occurrence analysis and correlations between AD parameters and taxonomic IDs of core microbiome members were calculated using microeco.\n\nNetwork construction and comparison for microbiome data were performed using NetComi, which calculated and normalized the association matrix.

  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our study, several performance metrics were reported to assess the quality and effectiveness of the metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and the overall analytical workflow. One of the key metrics reported was the completeness of the MAGs, with a notable finding that 36% of the non-redundant MAGs (nrMAGs) had more than 90% completeness. This metric is crucial as it indicates the extent to which the genome sequences are fully reconstructed, providing a comprehensive view of the microbial communities involved in the anaerobic digestion process.\n\nContamination levels were also assessed, with 6% of the nrMAGs identified as containing 0% contamination and 90% containing more than 5% contamination. This information is vital for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the genomic data, as contamination can skew the results and lead to misinterpretations.\n\nThe study also reported on the detection and assembly of 16S rRNA genes, which are essential for phylogenetic analysis and linking MAG data with 16S rRNA gene databases. A total of 82 nrMAGs were found to contain 16S rRNA genes, distributed across 22 phyla. This metric is significant because it allows for the identification and classification of microbial taxa, providing insights into the diversity and functional roles of the microorganisms in the biogas-producing communities.\n\nAdditionally, the mean copy number of 16S rRNA genes was estimated for different phyla, with Firmicutes showing the highest mean copy number (3.6 copies) and Halobacteriota and Methanobacteriota showing the lowest. This metric helps in understanding the abundance and distribution of specific microbial groups within the samples.\n\nThe performance metrics reported in this study are representative of current standards in metagenomics research. Completeness and contamination levels are commonly used metrics to evaluate the quality of MAGs, and the detection of 16S rRNA genes is a standard practice for phylogenetic analysis. The use of these metrics ensures that the findings are reliable and comparable to other studies in the field.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we employed a semi-supervised binning approach complemented with machine learning (ML) to analyze complex anaerobic biogas-producing communities. This method has been shown to outperform existing unsupervised nucleotide composition and abundance-based methods, such as Metabat2. The effectiveness of our approach was demonstrated through the production of high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). Specifically, Semibin generated 297 non-redundant MAGs, with 36% of these having more than 90% completeness. Notably, 6% of the MAGs contained 0% contamination, and 90% contained less than 5% contamination, as analyzed by CheckM2. This indicates a significant improvement in the quality and completeness of the MAGs compared to simpler baselines.\n\nAdditionally, our method allowed for the detection and assembly of 16S rRNA genes in 82 of the MAGs, distributed across 22 phyla. This capability is crucial for studying the genomics and phylogeny of uncultivated microorganisms and for connecting MAG data with 16S rRNA gene databases. The higher number of unique MAGs binned by Semibin also facilitated better mapping of metatranscriptome data, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the microbial community's functional potential.\n\nWhile we did not perform a direct comparison to publicly available methods on benchmark datasets, the results obtained from our approach align with previous research indicating the superiority of ML-based habitat-specific models in metagenome binning. The integration of ML with semi-supervised binning has proven to be highly beneficial for extending knowledge of microbial genomics in complex environments.",

For instance, the significance of differences between maximum biogas potentials was calculated using a between-pairs Wilcoxon test, with one-way ANOVAs used to compare multiple groups. This approach helps to determine if the observed differences are statistically significant.\n\nMultidimensional scaling of samples, MAG abundance, and activity values were visualized using MDS plots to display Bray-Curtis dissimilarities. Additionally, Euclidean distances and differences among samples were calculated using permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) with 1000 permutations. This method provides a robust statistical framework for assessing the significance of differences between samples.\n\nTo assess the significance of differences between MAGs, linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) was employed with a significance threshold of p \u2264 0.05. This analysis helps to identify features (e.g., MAGs) that are most likely to explain differences between groups.\n\nThe core microbiome was defined based on a taxon observed in 83.3% of samples with an abundance greater than 1 (~10x genome coverage). This criterion ensures that the identified core microbiome members are consistently present and abundant across the samples.\n\nFor differential gene expression and enrichment analysis, the DESeq2 package was used.
