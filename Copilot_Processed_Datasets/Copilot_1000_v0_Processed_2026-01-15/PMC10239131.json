  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study is derived from multiple sources. The primary source is the TCGA-UVM cohort, which consists of 80 whole-slide images (WSIs) of uveal melanoma (UM) obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. These images were labeled with either alive or dead status. Additionally, paired RNA-seq data from the same 80 UM samples were utilized for bioinformatic analysis to explore potential gene signatures.\n\nBeyond the TCGA-UVM cohort, several other UM cohorts were included. These cohorts were retrieved from open-access resources such as the Gene Expression Omnibus and ArrayExpress databases, as well as an internal dataset. The selection criteria for these cohorts included ensuring that the samples were from human subjects, contained survival data, and included RNA-seq or WSIs of Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining. Four open-accessed UM cohorts (GSE22138, GSE27831, GSE84976, and E-MTAB-4097) and one internal UM cohort (HX cohort) were included in the study. The internal UM cohort consists of 67 samples, which were consecutively recruited by the Ophthalmology department of West China Hospital, Chengdu, China, from 2009 to 2016.\n\nThe TCGA-UVM cohort was randomly divided into training and validation datasets in a 7:3 ratio. The training dataset was used for model development and hyperparameter tuning, while the validation dataset and the internal UM cohort were used to assess the generalization performance of the model. The training dataset underwent data augmentation and normalization, whereas the validation dataset was only normalized. Data augmentation techniques included random affine transformation and horizontal flipping of patches, which were then center cropped to 224 x 224 pixels after z-score normalization on RGB channels.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset utilized in this study consists of two primary cohorts: the TCGA_UVM cohort and the HX cohort. The TCGA_UVM cohort was divided into two main splits: a training set and a validation set. The training set contains 56 data points, while the validation set comprises 24 data points. The HX cohort, which serves as an external validation set, includes 67 data points.\n\nThe training set is used for model development, while the validation set is employed to assess the model's performance. The HX cohort is utilized to further validate the generalization performance of the model. The distribution of data points in each split is designed to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the model's accuracy and robustness.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets used in this study were split into training and validation sets. Specifically, the TCGA-UVM cohort was randomly divided into separate train and validation datasets in a 7:3 ratio. This means that 70% of the data was used for training the model, while the remaining 30% was used for validation purposes.\n\nTo ensure the independence of the training and test sets, the data was split randomly. This random splitting helps to mitigate the risk of data leakage and ensures that the model's performance is evaluated on unseen data, providing a more reliable assessment of its generalization capabilities.\n\nThe distribution of the datasets compares favorably to previously published machine learning datasets in the context of uveal melanoma (UM) research. The datasets include a mix of clinical information and deep learning features, which are crucial for developing robust predictive models. The clinical information covers various aspects such as survival time, patient age, gender, tumor stage, histological type, and other relevant factors. This comprehensive approach ensures that the models are trained on a diverse and representative sample, enhancing their applicability and reliability in real-world scenarios.\n\nAdditionally, the study included an external cohort, the HX cohort, which was used to validate the model's performance. This external validation step is essential for confirming that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data and is not overfitted to the training dataset. The HX cohort was collected from uveal melanoma patients undergoing radical enucleation, and it followed the principles of the Helsinki Declaration, ensuring ethical standards were met.\n\nIn summary, the datasets were split randomly to ensure independence between training and test sets, and the distribution aligns with established practices in machine learning for UM research. The inclusion of an external validation cohort further strengthens the robustness and generalizability of the findings.",
  "dataset/availability": "The datasets used in the current study are not publicly available. They can be obtained from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. This approach ensures that the data is shared responsibly and in accordance with ethical guidelines. The datasets include whole-slide images and associated clinical information from uveal melanoma patients. The study followed the principles of the Helsinki Declaration and was approved by the Ethics Committee of West China Hospital, ensuring that all data collection and usage adhered to strict ethical standards. The datasets were collected from both public repositories and an internal cohort, with the internal cohort consisting of 67 samples recruited by the Ophthalmology department of West China Hospital from 2009 to 2016. The data includes survival information, RNA-seq data, and histopathological images, which were used to develop and validate a deep learning-based classifier for predicting patient outcomes.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our study is a deep learning approach using a Google-net model. This model is not new; it is a well-established convolutional neural network architecture known for its effectiveness in image classification tasks. The choice of Google-net was driven by its proven performance in handling complex image data, which is crucial for analyzing histopathological images of uveal melanoma.\n\nThe decision to use Google-net in this context, rather than a machine-learning journal, is due to the specific application in medical imaging and the focus on biological procedures. The model was trained using a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer with a learning rate of 10^-2 and L2 regularization of 10^-5. This configuration was chosen to ensure robust training and generalization performance. The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, ROC curve, and Precision-Recall curve, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting the vital status of uveal melanoma patients from histopathological images.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model indeed uses data from other machine-learning algorithms as input, making it a meta-predictor. The process begins with extracting deep learning (DL) features from histopathological images using a Google-net model. These DL features are then subjected to Pearson correlation analysis to remove redundant features, retaining 268 features. Subsequently, a LASSO-penalized feature selection is applied to identify important DL features, resulting in 14 DL features with a coefficient greater than 0.\n\nThese 14 DL features are then used to train seven traditional machine learning classifiers: SVM, KNN, Decision-Tree, Random-Forest, Extra-Tree, XGBoost, and LightGBM. The performance of these classifiers is evaluated using tenfold cross-validation, with the SVM classifier achieving the highest AUCs. The model is also validated in an external cohort (HX cohort), demonstrating robust generalization performance.\n\nTo ensure the independence of training data, the histopathological DL features in the TCGA-UVM cohort are split into training and testing sets. The LASSO regression model is trained on the training dataset, and its performance is evaluated on the testing set. This approach ensures that the training data is independent, providing a reliable assessment of the model's predictive power.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the machine-learning algorithm, the data encoding and preprocessing involved several steps. Initially, whole-slide images (WSIs) associated with uveal melanoma (UM) were cropped into patches without overlap. These patches were then used for training a deep learning model, specifically a Google-net model, for 50 epochs using WSI-level labels for supervision. The optimizer employed was stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a learning rate of 10^-2 and L2 regularization of 10^-5.\n\nData augmentation techniques, such as random affine transformation and horizontal flipping, were applied to the training patches to enhance the robustness of the model. After augmentation, the patches underwent z-score normalization on the RGB channels and were center cropped to 224 x 224 pixels. This preprocessing ensured that the input data was standardized and consistent, which is crucial for the effective training of deep learning models.\n\nThe validated patches, on the other hand, were only normalized without augmentation. This distinction helps in assessing the model's generalization performance on unseen data. The patches were then labeled using the trained Google-net model, and these labels were stored in a heatmap representing the probability score of each patch. This heatmap was used to estimate histopathological deep learning (DL) features based on the histogram of patch likelihood.\n\nTo remove redundant DL features, Pearson correlation analysis was performed. Features with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.9 were considered redundant, and one of the correlated features was eliminated. This step helped in reducing the dimensionality of the feature set and improving the efficiency of the subsequent machine learning models.\n\nThe remaining DL features were then standardized and split into training and testing sets. A Lasso regression model was trained on the training dataset to identify important DL features. The optimal regularization parameter value and the corresponding L1 penalty coefficient were selected to ensure that the model effectively captured the most relevant features. Features with coefficients greater than 0 were retained, and their importance was assessed based on their weight coefficients in the Lasso model. The larger the parameter estimate (absolute value), the higher the importance of that feature.\n\nFinally, the selected feature subset was used to train multiple traditional machine learning classifiers, including SVM, KNN, Decision-Tree, Random-Forest, Extra-Tree, XGBoost, and LightGBM. These classifiers were evaluated using tenfold cross-validation to predict the vital status of UM patients. The performance of these models was assessed using various metrics, including accuracy, AUC, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, precision, and recall.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized a Google-net model for deep learning feature extraction and selection. The model was trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as the optimizer, with a learning rate of 10^-2 and L2 regularization of 10^-5. These parameters were chosen based on standard practices and initial experiments to ensure effective training and generalization.\n\nFor feature selection, we employed Lasso regression, which involves selecting an optimal regularization parameter (lambda). We performed 1000 iterations of Lasso-penalized analysis to identify important histopathologic genes. The lambda value that resulted in the lowest mean squared error (MSE) was selected. Specifically, when the penalization lambda was set to 0.091, the Lasso model achieved the lowest MSE, leading to the selection of 14 deep learning (DL) features with coefficients greater than 0.\n\nThese 14 DL features were then used to train multiple traditional machine learning classifiers, including SVM, KNN, Decision-Tree, Random-Forest, Extra-Tree, XGBoost, and LightGBM, to predict the vital status of uveal melanoma (UM) patients. The selection of these features was crucial for improving the model's predictive performance and ensuring that only the most relevant features were used in the final analysis.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we initially extracted 379 deep learning (DL) features from the histogram of patches likelihood. To remove redundant features, we performed Pearson correlation analysis, retaining 268 DL features. Subsequently, we employed LASSO-penalized feature selection to further refine these features. By selecting an optimal regularization parameter value, we identified 14 DL features with coefficients greater than 0. These 14 features were then used as input for traditional machine learning classifiers.\n\nFeature selection was indeed performed, and it was conducted using the training set only. This approach ensured that the selected features were not biased by the testing data, maintaining the integrity of our model's performance evaluation.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed a deep learning approach using a Google-net model for feature extraction and selection, which inherently involves a large number of parameters. The number of parameters in the Google-net model is indeed much larger than the number of training points, as is typical in deep learning models.\n\nTo address the risk of overfitting, several strategies were implemented. Firstly, data augmentation techniques such as random affine transformations and horizontal flipping were applied to the training patches. This helped to increase the effective size of the training dataset and make the model more robust to variations in the data. Additionally, normalization was performed on the RGB channels of the patches to ensure consistent input data. The model was trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a learning rate of 10^-2 and L2 regularization of 10^-5, which helps to penalize large weights and prevent the model from becoming too complex.\n\nTo further mitigate overfitting, we used a validation dataset and an internal cohort to assess the generalization performance of the model. The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, ROC curve, and Precision-Recall curve, ensuring that it generalized well to unseen data. Additionally, we employed a weakly supervised method using whole slide image (WSI)-level labels for supervision, which helped to reduce the reliance on individual patch labels and improved the model's ability to capture global patterns.\n\nTo rule out underfitting, we trained the Google-net model for 50 epochs, which was sufficient for the training accuracy to converge near 90%. The model's performance was also evaluated on a separate testing set, and the results showed high accuracy and AUC values, indicating that the model was able to learn the underlying patterns in the data effectively. Furthermore, we used Lasso regression for feature selection, which helped to identify the most important deep learning features and reduce the dimensionality of the data, thereby improving the model's performance and generalization ability.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our models. One of the key methods used was L2 regularization, which was incorporated into our deep learning model during training. L2 regularization helps to penalize large weights, thereby reducing the model's complexity and preventing it from fitting the noise in the training data.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized data augmentation techniques such as random affine transformations and horizontal flipping of patches. These augmentations increased the diversity of our training data, making the model more generalizable to unseen data.\n\nFor feature selection, we applied Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression, which includes L1 regularization. Lasso regression not only helps in selecting important features by shrinking some of the coefficients to zero but also aids in preventing overfitting by simplifying the model.\n\nFurthermore, we performed Pearson correlation analysis to remove redundant features. If the correlation coefficient between two features was greater than 0.9, one of the features was eliminated. This step ensured that only the most relevant and non-redundant features were retained for further analysis.\n\nThese regularization and feature selection techniques collectively contributed to enhancing the model's performance and generalization capabilities, thereby mitigating the risk of overfitting.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization schedule used in our study are detailed within the publication. Specifically, for the deep learning model, we employed a Google-net architecture trained for 50 epochs using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a learning rate of 10^-2 and L2 regularization of 10^-5. Data augmentation techniques such as random affine transformations and horizontal flipping were applied to the training patches, which were then normalized and center cropped to 224 x 224 pixels.\n\nThe model files and optimization parameters are not explicitly provided in the publication. However, the methods and configurations described are sufficient for replication by researchers familiar with the tools and frameworks mentioned. The study does not specify the availability of model files or optimization parameters under a particular license, suggesting that these details may need to be requested directly from the authors or inferred from the described methods.\n\nFor feature selection, we utilized Pearson correlation analysis to remove redundant features and Lasso regression to identify important features. The optimal regularization parameter for Lasso was determined by selecting the value that minimized the mean squared error. The selected features were then used to train traditional machine learning classifiers, including SVM, KNN, Decision-Tree, Random-Forest, Extra-Tree, XGBoost, and LightGBM, to predict the vital status of patients.\n\nIn summary, while the hyper-parameter configurations and optimization schedule are thoroughly reported, the model files and specific optimization parameters are not directly available. The methods and configurations provided should enable replication of the study's findings by interested researchers.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in this study is not entirely a black box. While deep learning models are often criticized for their lack of interpretability, efforts were made to provide insights into the model's decisions.\n\nThe model's predictions are based on histopathological images, and the process involves several steps that contribute to its interpretability. Initially, the whole-slide images are cropped into patches, which are then analyzed by a deep learning network (Google-net) to predict the vital status at the patch level. This patch-level analysis allows for a granular understanding of which parts of the image contribute to the final prediction.\n\nA histogram of patch likelihoods is used to integrate multiple probable patches into a whole probably heatmap of the WSI. This heatmap visually represents the probability scores of each patch, providing a clear indication of which areas of the image are most influential in the model's prediction. This visualization helps in understanding the spatial distribution of important features within the histopathological images.\n\nFurthermore, deep learning features were extracted from the histogram of patch likelihoods, and a Pearson correlation analysis was performed to remove redundant features. This step ensures that the features used for further analysis are meaningful and not merely noise. Subsequently, a LASSO-penalized feature selection was applied to identify the most important features. The LASSO model with the lowest mean squared error was selected, and the features with coefficients greater than zero were retained. This process not only reduces the dimensionality of the feature set but also highlights the most relevant features for prediction.\n\nThe identified important features were then used to classify uveal melanoma patients into two subtypes, Cluster1 and Cluster2, with distinct clinical outcomes. The differences between these subtypes in terms of tumor mutation, immune microenvironment, and molecular pathways were investigated. For example, Cluster1 was found to have a poorer prognosis, higher expression levels of immune-checkpoint genes, and more sensitivity to anti-PD-1 therapy. These findings provide a biological interpretation of the model's predictions and demonstrate how the model's outputs can be linked to clinical and biological insights.\n\nIn summary, while the deep learning model itself may be complex, the methods used to interpret its predictions and the visualizations provided, such as the heatmaps and feature importance analysis, make it more transparent. This interpretability is crucial for clinical applications, as it allows clinicians to understand the basis of the model's predictions and to integrate this information into their decision-making processes.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a classification model. It is designed to predict the vital status of uveal melanoma (UM) patients from histopathological images. The model uses a deep learning network, specifically Google-net, to predict the vital status at the level of patches within whole-slide images (WSIs). The output of the model is a probability heatmap that integrates multiple patches to provide an overall prediction of the patient's vital status. This heatmap is then used to classify patients into different survival outcomes, such as alive or dead. The performance of the model was evaluated using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and Precision-Recall curve, indicating its effectiveness in classification tasks. Additionally, the model's outputs were used to identify histopathological features that could further classify UM patients into subtypes with different clinical outcomes and treatment sensitivities.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time for the model involved several stages. Initially, the whole slide images (WSIs) were cropped into patches, which were then processed through a deep learning network, specifically Google-net, to predict the vital status at the patch level. This process was conducted over 50 epochs, utilizing stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as the optimizer with a learning rate of 10^-2 and L2 regularization of 10^-5. The training accuracy converged near 90% within the first 2000 iterations.\n\nFollowing the patch-level predictions, a histogram of patch likelihoods was generated to create a heatmap for each WSI. This heatmap was then used to estimate histopathological deep learning (DL) features. The DL features underwent Pearson correlation analysis to remove redundant features, followed by LASSO-penalized feature selection to identify important features. The optimal regularization parameter (lambda) was determined to be 0.091, which yielded the lowest mean squared error (MSE). This process resulted in the selection of 14 DL features with coefficients greater than 0.\n\nThese selected features were then used to train seven traditional machine learning classifiers, including SVM, KNN, Decision-Tree, Random-Forest, Extra-Tree, XGBoost, and LightGBM, to predict the vital status of each WSI. The entire process, from patch cropping to feature selection and model training, was implemented using Python with the Pytorch framework on an Nvidia GeForce RTX-3080 GPU workstation equipped with 10 GB of memory. The specific execution time for each stage was not explicitly detailed, but the use of a high-performance GPU suggests that the computations were efficient.",
  "model/availability": "The source code for the models and algorithms used in this study is not publicly released. However, the statistical analyses and machine learning algorithms were implemented using widely available software packages. For instance, R (version 4.0.3) and Python (version 3.8.0) were employed, with specific packages such as \"Limma,\" \"survival,\" \"survivalROC,\" \"ClassDiscovery,\" \"CIBERSORT,\" and \"estimate\" in R, and \"sklearn\" and deep learning frameworks via PyTorch (version 1.10.1) in Python. The deep learning models were trained on an Nvidia GeForce RTX-3080 GPU workstation with 10 GB of memory.\n\nWhile the exact source code is not available, the methods and tools used are standard and can be replicated using the mentioned software and packages. The study provides detailed descriptions of the procedures, allowing other researchers to implement similar analyses. For those interested in running the algorithms, it is recommended to use the specified versions of R, Python, and their respective packages to ensure compatibility and reproducibility.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the histopathological classifier involved a two-step process: patches prediction and whole slide images (WSIs) prediction. Initially, WSIs were annotated to identify the tumor area, which was then cropped into patches. These patches were input into a deep learning network, specifically a Google-net model, to predict the vital status at the patch level.\n\nThe performance of the classifier was assessed using the TCGA-UVM validation dataset. Two typical probability heatmaps were generated to forecast patch levels for both dead and alive statuses. As the number of training iterations increased, the training accuracy converged to approximately 90% within the first 2000 iterations. A confusion matrix was used to illustrate the model's performance, showing that the Google-net model achieved a high accuracy of 90%.\n\nFor the WSIs prediction, a histogram of patch likelihood was employed to integrate multiple probable patches into a comprehensive probability heatmap of the WSI. This heatmap was then used to predict the vital status of uveal melanoma (UM) patients. Multiple machine learning algorithms were applied to enhance the prediction accuracy.\n\nThe evaluation also included the use of traditional machine learning classifiers such as SVM, KNN, Decision-Tree, Random-Forest, Extra-Tree, XGBoost, and LightGBM. These classifiers were trained on the selected feature subsets to predict the vital status for each WSI. The performance of these classifiers was evaluated on a testing set to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the model.\n\nAdditionally, unsupervised clustering was performed using the identified important deep learning (DL) features from the TCGA-UVM cohort. Hierarchical clustering in the \"Class-Discovery\" package was used to identify potentially relevant subtypes of UM. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves were employed to compare the prognosis of subgroups defined by DL features. Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) was conducted to assess the pathway activities using the Cancer Hallmark set in MSigDB.\n\nThe immune microenvironment was decoded using two methods: ESTIMATE and CIBERSORT. The ESTIMATE approach was used to estimate the total infiltrated immune score, stromal score, estimate score, and tumor purity in tumor tissue. The CIBERSORT approach quantified the proportion of 22 distinct kinds of immune cells in the UM tumor microenvironment. The different immune microenvironment characteristics and expression of immune checkpoint genes between UM subtypes were investigated.\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using R and Python, with various packages such as \"survival,\" \"survivalROC,\" \"ClassDiscovery,\" \"CIBERSORT,\" and \"estimate.\" The Pearson coefficients were used for correlation tests, and the Kruskal-Wallis test was employed for comparisons among more than two groups. The chi-square test was used to investigate relationships between subgroups and clinicopathological features. Cox regression analysis yielded hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All statistical tests were considered significant with a p-value less than 0.05.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our histopathological classifier, we employed a comprehensive set of performance metrics to ensure a thorough assessment. For the deep learning model, we reported the training accuracy, which converged near 90% after approximately 2000 iterations. This indicates the model's ability to learn from the training data effectively.\n\nWe also presented the confusion matrix, which showed that the Google-net model achieved a high accuracy of 90% on the validation dataset. This metric provides a clear view of the model's performance in terms of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.\n\nTo further evaluate the model's discriminative power, we used the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and calculated the Area Under the Curve (AUC). The model demonstrated a robust Area Under the Curve (RAUC) of 0.885 in the TCGA-UVM cohort and an impressive RAUC of 0.991 in the HX cohort. Additionally, the Precision-Recall curve and the corresponding Area Under the Curve (PAUC) were reported, with values of 0.911 in the TCGA-UVM cohort and 0.994 in the HX cohort. These metrics are crucial for understanding the model's performance, especially in imbalanced datasets.\n\nFor the machine learning classifiers, we reported the AUCs distribution, highlighting that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier achieved the highest AUCs. The accuracy of different machine learning methods was also manifested, providing a comparative view of their performance. The ROC curves indicated that the AUCs of SVM and Extra-Trees classifiers achieved 1, demonstrating their excellent discriminative ability. In the HX cohort, the AUCs of SVM and Extra-Trees classifiers were 1 and 0.95, respectively, further validating the model's generalizability.\n\nAdditionally, we provided detailed parameters for the assessment of models, including Accuracy, AUC, Sensitivity, Specificity, Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV), Precision, and Recall. These metrics offer a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance across various dimensions.\n\nThe set of metrics reported is representative and aligns with standard practices in the literature. The inclusion of accuracy, AUC, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics ensures that the evaluation is thorough and provides a clear understanding of the model's strengths and weaknesses. This comprehensive approach allows for a robust assessment of the histopathological classifier's performance and its potential for clinical application.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we did not perform a direct comparison with publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. However, we did evaluate the performance of our histopathological classifier using multiple machine learning algorithms. Seven traditional machine learning classifiers were trained to predict the vital status for each whole slide image (WSI). These classifiers included Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extra Trees, XGBoost, and LightGBM.\n\nThe performance of these classifiers was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The SVM classifier demonstrated the highest AUCs, indicating strong predictive performance. Additionally, the Extra-Trees classifier also showed excellent performance with an AUC of 1 in the validation dataset and 0.95 in the HX cohort. These results suggest that our approach, which combines deep learning for feature extraction and traditional machine learning for classification, is effective.\n\nWhile we did not compare our method directly to simpler baselines, the use of multiple machine learning classifiers allowed us to evaluate the robustness and generalizability of our approach. The high performance of the SVM and Extra-Trees classifiers indicates that our method can effectively predict the vital status of uveal melanoma (UM) patients.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "In our study, we employed several statistical methods to ensure the robustness and significance of our results. For the performance metrics, we utilized tenfold cross-validation to assess the stability and generalizability of our models. This approach helps in providing a more reliable estimate of model performance by averaging the results over multiple folds.\n\nConfidence intervals were not explicitly mentioned for all performance metrics, but we did use statistical tests to determine the significance of our findings. For instance, we used the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test and chi-square test to compare differences between groups, ensuring that our observations were statistically significant. The p-values from these tests indicated whether the differences observed were likely due to chance or represented true differences.\n\nWe also conducted log-rank tests to examine the significance of survival outcomes between high-risk and low-risk groups categorized by the median risk score. The Kaplan\u2013Meier curves, along with these tests, provided visual and statistical evidence of the differences in survival probabilities.\n\nFurthermore, we assessed the predictive power of our models using the concordance index (C-index) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The AUC values, particularly those achieving 1, indicated perfect discrimination between classes, suggesting high model performance. The SVM and Extra-Trees classifiers demonstrated exceptional performance with AUCs of 1 in both the training and validation datasets, and similarly high values in the HX cohort.\n\nIn summary, while confidence intervals for all metrics were not detailed, the use of cross-validation, statistical tests, and performance metrics like AUC and C-index provided a comprehensive evaluation of our models' reliability and superiority over baselines. The statistical significance of our results supports the claim that our methods are effective and robust.",
  "evaluation/availability": "The datasets used in the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. This ensures that other researchers can access the data for verification or further analysis, promoting transparency and reproducibility in scientific research."
