  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset utilized in this study was derived from bone marrow samples obtained from multiple myeloma (MM) patients at the Royal Melbourne Hospital and Monash Health, both located in Melbourne, Australia. The study was approved by the relevant Human Research Ethics Committees and Institutional Review Boards.\n\nThe bone marrow samples were processed to isolate fresh bone marrow mononuclear cells using Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. Approximately 500,000 cells were isolated and stained with specific antibodies to identify myeloma cells, which were characterized as CD45\u2212CD38+CD138+/\u2212. The samples were then treated with either 100 nM S63845, 100 nM dexamethasone, or a combination of both. Cell viability was assessed using PI/Annexin V staining after 24 hours.\n\nThe data generated from these experiments were analyzed using mass cytometry, which allowed for the quantification of major BCL-2 family members at the single-cell level. The mean expression values for all proteins were calculated and asinh transformed for further analysis. Heatmaps and FLOW-MAPs were generated to visualize the data, and random forest modeling was employed to identify determinants of cell survival.\n\nThe dataset includes a substantial number of data points, encompassing the expression levels of various proteins across different treatment conditions and time points. The specific number of data points is not explicitly stated, but the study involved multiple replicates and treatments, ensuring a robust dataset for analysis.\n\nThis dataset has not been previously published or used by the community, as it is part of the current study's original research. The methods and code used for data generation and analysis have been made available on GitHub, facilitating reproducibility and potential future use by the scientific community.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was split into a training dataset and test datasets. The training dataset consisted of 80% of the data from one of the three treatment replicates, specifically Run 3. This means that the training dataset contained a substantial portion of the available data, ensuring robust model training.\n\nThe test datasets included the remaining 20% of Run 3 data and two complete, independent technical replicates (Runs 1 and 2). This approach allowed for thorough validation of the models across multiple experiments, ensuring their robustness and generalizability. The distribution of data points in each split was designed to provide a comprehensive evaluation, with the training dataset being the largest to facilitate effective model development, and the test datasets being diverse to assess performance across different conditions.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "Not enough information is available.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data used in this study is not publicly available. However, the code used to generate heatmaps and FLOW-MAPs is available on GitHub at https://github.com/mesako/BCL2-Publication. Additionally, the code for random forest modeling is also available on the same GitHub repository. The supplementary methods provide further details on the data analysis processes.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used is the random forest model (RFM). This approach utilizes an ensemble of decision trees, where each tree makes decisions based on the expression levels of single markers from CyTOF data. The RFM classifies cells into \"viable\" or \"apoptotic\" categories by aggregating the decisions from multiple trees, essentially taking a popular vote across the ensemble.\n\nThe RFM is not a new algorithm; it is a well-established machine-learning technique known for its robustness and ability to handle high-dimensional data. The decision to use this algorithm in this context is driven by its suitability for high-throughput, high-parameter resolution at the single-cell level. The RFM's ability to identify key features that distinguish viable from apoptotic cells makes it an effective tool for analyzing complex biological data.\n\nThe focus of this study is on the biological insights gained from applying the RFM to understand cell survival and apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells treated with cytotoxic drugs. The algorithm's performance and the biological significance of the results are the primary areas of interest, rather than the novelty of the machine-learning technique itself. Therefore, the RFM was not published in a machine-learning journal because the innovation lies in its application to biological data and the resulting biological discoveries.",
  "optimization/meta": "The models developed in this study are random forest models (RFMs), which are an ensemble learning method. They do not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, they utilize an ensemble of decision trees, where each tree makes decisions based on the expression levels of single markers from CyTOF data. The final classification of a cell as \"viable\" or \"apoptotic\" is determined by a popular vote across many decision trees.\n\nThe RFMs were trained using a \"training dataset\" that consisted of 80% of the data from one of three treatment replicates. This dataset was used to develop models that could accurately classify cells into \"viable\" or \"apoptotic\" categories based on marker expression levels. The models were then tested against independent datasets to ensure their robustness and accuracy.\n\nThe training data for the RFMs is independent, as it was derived from a subset of the available data (80% of Run 3 data). The models were validated using separate datasets, including 20% of Run 3 data and two complete, independent technical replicates (Runs 1 and 2). This approach ensures that the models are not overfitted to the training data and can generalize well to new, unseen data. The performance of the models was evaluated using receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curves, which demonstrated high accuracy across all datasets.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps. Initially, mean expression values for all proteins were calculated using Cytobank and then exported into R for further analysis. These values underwent an asinh transformation to stabilize variance and normalize the data. This transformed data was then used to generate heatmaps in R, providing a visual summary of relative protein expression levels over time with different treatments.\n\nFor the random forest modeling, the randomForest package in R was utilized. The data was split into a training dataset, consisting of 80% of the data from one of the treatment replicates, and a test dataset. The training dataset was used to develop single-cell classification random forest models (RFMs) to distinguish viable from apoptotic cells following drug treatment. The models were trained to classify cells into two outcomes: \"viable\" (aCASP3neg) or \"apoptotic\" (aCASP3pos) based on the expression levels of various markers from the CyTOF data, excluding definitive apoptosis markers like aCASP3 or cPARP.\n\nThe RFMs utilized an ensemble of decision trees, where each tree made decisions based on the expression levels of a single marker. The models were evaluated using tenfold cross-validation on the training dataset to select the best model. The relative effectiveness of each marker in separating the two classes was ranked according to the mean decrease in the Gini impurity index across all trees in the ensemble. This index reflects the accuracy of the groupings, indicating how pure the \"apoptotic\" group is in terms of containing viable cells.\n\nThe performance of the models was assessed using receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) values, which indicated high sensitivity, specificity, and robustness despite experimental variations. The models were tested against independent technical replicates to ensure their robustness across multiple experiments.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized two distinct models to classify cells as either viable or apoptotic based on their protein expression profiles. The first model, termed the \"BCL-2 family\" model, focused exclusively on six key BCL-2 family proteins: MCL-1, BCL-2, BCL-XL, BIM, BAX, and aBAK. This model used sequential cut-offs of these proteins to make classification decisions.\n\nThe second model, referred to as the \"most features\" model, expanded on the first by incorporating additional markers: pAKT, p53, pSTAT5, MYC, I\u03baB\u03b1, pS6, pCREB, p-p38, and pERK, alongside the BCL-2 family proteins. This model aimed to capture a broader range of cellular states and responses to treatment.\n\nThe selection of parameters for these models was driven by the goal of identifying the most informative features for distinguishing between viable and apoptotic cells. For the \"BCL-2 family\" model, the parameters were chosen based on their established roles in regulating cell survival and apoptosis. The \"most features\" model included additional markers that were known to be involved in various signaling pathways relevant to cell fate decisions.\n\nThe effectiveness of each marker in separating the two classes was ranked according to the mean decrease in the Gini impurity index across all trees in the ensemble. This index reflects the accuracy of the groupings, indicating how well the model can distinguish between apoptotic and viable cells. The parameters that provided the greatest reduction in impurity index were considered the most discriminating.\n\nIn summary, the \"BCL-2 family\" model used six parameters, while the \"most features\" model used sixteen parameters. The selection of these parameters was based on their biological relevance and their ability to accurately classify cells into viable or apoptotic categories.",
  "optimization/features": "In the optimization process, two distinct models were developed to classify cells as either viable or apoptotic based on their response to drug treatments. The first model, termed the \"BCL-2 family\" model, utilized a set of six features: MCL-1, BCL-2, BCL-XL, BIM, BAX, and aBAK. These features were selected based on their known roles in apoptotic pathways.\n\nThe second model, referred to as the \"most features\" model, expanded the feature set to include additional markers: pAKT, p53, pSTAT5, MYC, I\u03baB\u03b1, pS6, pCREB, p-p38, and pERK, alongside the BCL-2 family proteins. This model aimed to incorporate a broader range of cellular signals and states to improve classification accuracy.\n\nFeature selection was performed using the training dataset, which consisted of 80% of the data from one of the treatment replicates. The relative importance of each feature in distinguishing between viable and apoptotic cells was ranked according to the mean decrease in the Gini impurity index across all decision trees in the ensemble. This index reflects the accuracy of the groupings and the extent to which the apoptotic group might contain impurities (viable cells). The most discriminating features provided the greatest reduction in the impurity index.\n\nThe models were trained using an ensemble of decision trees, where each tree made decisions based on the expression levels of a single marker. The final classification was determined by a popular vote across many decision trees. The best model was selected through tenfold cross-validation on the training dataset, ensuring robustness and generalizability. The performance of the models was evaluated using receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) values, which indicated high sensitivity, specificity, and robustness despite experimental variations.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study utilized random forest models (RFMs) to classify cells as either viable or apoptotic based on CyTOF data. The training dataset consisted of 80% of the data from one of three treatment replicates, ensuring a robust sample size for model training.\n\nThe number of parameters, which include the expression levels of various markers, is indeed larger than the number of training points. To address potential overfitting, we implemented tenfold cross-validation on the training dataset. This technique helps to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data by validating its performance across multiple subsets of the training data. Additionally, the models demonstrated high area under the curve (AUC) values exceeding 96%, indicating strong sensitivity, specificity, and robustness despite experimental variations.\n\nTo mitigate underfitting, we utilized an ensemble of decision trees within the RFM. Each tree makes decisions based on the expression levels of single markers, analogous to hierarchical-gating steps. The final classification is determined by a popular vote across many decision trees, which helps to capture complex relationships in the data. The relative effectiveness of each marker in separating the two classes was ranked according to the mean decrease in the Gini impurity index, ensuring that the most discriminating features were prioritized.\n\nThe performance of the models was comparable between bortezomib- and dexamethasone-treatment datasets, further validating the robustness of the fitting method. The \"BCL-2 family\" model, which used only six BCL-2 family proteins, was only marginally less accurate than the \"most features\" model, indicating that the key determinants of cell survival were effectively captured.",
  "optimization/regularization": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations, optimization schedule, and model files are available. The code for generating heatmaps and FLOW-MAPs, as well as the random forest modeling, has been made publicly accessible. This includes details on the random forest model (RFM) and the parameters used in the analysis. The code can be found on GitHub at the repository https://github.com/mesako/BCL2-Publication. This repository likely contains the necessary scripts and configurations used for the optimization and analysis processes described in the study. The availability of this code ensures reproducibility and allows other researchers to utilize or build upon the methods and findings presented.",
  "model/interpretability": "The models developed in this study are not black-box but rather transparent, as they utilize random forest modeling, which is an interpretable machine-learning approach. The random forest model (RFM) employs an ensemble of decision trees, where each tree makes decisions based on the expression levels of single markers from the CyTOF data. This process is analogous to hierarchical gating steps in flow cytometry, making it easier to understand and interpret.\n\nIn the \"BCL-2 family\" model, decisions are based on sequential cut-offs of MCL-1, BCL-2, BCL-XL, BIM, BAX, and activated BAK levels per cell. This model focuses solely on the BCL-2 family proteins, providing a clear and specific set of features that influence cell viability and apoptosis. The \"most features\" model expands on this by including additional markers such as pAKT, p53, pSTAT5, MYC, I\u03baB\u03b1, pS6, pCREB, p-p38, and pERK, along with the BCL-2 family proteins. This model offers a more comprehensive view of the cellular processes involved in drug response.\n\nThe interpretability of these models is further enhanced by the ranking of markers according to their importance in distinguishing between viable and apoptotic cells. For instance, in the \"most features\" RFMs, pCREB and MCL-1 were identified as the most informative markers for distinguishing apoptotic from viable myeloma cells following exposure to either bortezomib or dexamethasone. Additionally, drug-specific features were highlighted, such as p-p38, BIM, and p53 for bortezomib-treated cells, and I\u03baB\u03b1, pS6, and BIM for dexamethasone-treated cells. This detailed ranking allows for a clear understanding of which markers are most critical in predicting cell fate.\n\nThe models' transparency is also demonstrated through their robustness and accuracy across multiple experiments. The RFMs were tested against independent technical replicates, and their predictions were compared with actual cell states based on aCASP3 levels. The high area under the curve (AUC) values in the receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curves indicate that the models are not only accurate but also reliable in identifying key features that predict apoptosis. This transparency ensures that the models can be trusted and their results can be confidently interpreted in the context of myeloma cell response to drug treatments.",
  "model/output": "The model developed is a classification model. Specifically, it is a random forest model (RFM) designed to classify cells as either \"viable\" or \"apoptotic\" based on their marker expression levels. The model utilizes an ensemble of decision trees, where each tree makes decisions based on the expression levels of single markers from CyTOF data. The final classification is determined by a popular vote across many decision trees. The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curves, which indicated high sensitivity, specificity, and robustness across different datasets and experimental conditions. The model was trained on a dataset consisting of 80% of the data from one treatment replicate and tested on independent technical replicates, demonstrating its ability to accurately predict cell outcomes following drug treatment.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "The source code for generating heatmaps and FLOW-MAPs is publicly available on GitHub. The repository can be accessed at https://github.com/mesako/BCL2-Publication. Additionally, the code for random forest modeling is also available in the same repository. The specific package used for random forest modeling is the randomForest package in R. The details of the methodology and the code are provided in the Supplementary Methods. The code and methods are made available to facilitate reproducibility and further research.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the method involved several rigorous steps to ensure its robustness and accuracy. Initially, random forest models (RFMs) were developed using a \"training dataset\" that consisted of 80% of the data from one of the treatment replicates. These models classified cells into \"viable\" or \"apoptotic\" categories based on the expression levels of various markers, excluding definitive apoptosis markers like activated Caspase-3 (aCASP3) or cleaved PARP (cPARP).\n\nTo select the best model, tenfold cross-validation was performed on the training dataset. This process helped in ranking the relative effectiveness of each marker in distinguishing between the two classes, using the mean decrease in the Gini impurity index across all trees in the ensemble. The parameter that provided the greatest reduction in impurity index was considered the most discriminating between \"apoptotic\" and \"viable\" cells.\n\nThe robustness of the models was further tested against \"test datasets,\" which included 20% of the data from the training replicate and two complete, independent technical replicates. The model predictions were compared with the actual states of the cells based on aCASP3 levels. The performance of the models was evaluated using receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curves, which showed high area under the curve (AUC) values, indicating that the models were highly accurate and robust. The \"BCL-2 family\" model, which utilized only the six BCL-2 family proteins, performed almost as well as the \"most features\" model, which included additional markers. This suggests that the BCL-2 family proteins are highly predictive of apoptosis in myeloma cells treated with cytotoxic drugs.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our evaluation, we primarily focused on the Area Under the Curve (AUC) values to assess the performance of our models. The AUC values exceeded 96% for all models, indicating that they are highly sensitive, specific, and robust. This metric is widely used in the literature for evaluating the performance of classification models, particularly in the context of binary outcomes such as viable versus apoptotic cells.\n\nThe AUC provides a comprehensive measure of a model's ability to distinguish between the two classes across all possible classification thresholds. An AUC of 96% or higher suggests that our models are highly effective in accurately classifying cells as either viable or apoptotic, regardless of experimental variations.\n\nAdditionally, we employed the Gini impurity index to rank the relative effectiveness of each marker in separating the two classes. This index reflects how accurately the groupings are, assessed by the activated Caspase-3 (aCASP3) status. The parameter that provides the greatest reduction in the impurity index is considered the most discriminating between apoptotic and viable cells.\n\nWe also utilized Receiving Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves to further validate the models' performance. The ROC curves had area under the curve values that confirmed the robustness of our models across multiple experiments. This approach is standard in the field and ensures that our models are not only accurate but also reliable across different datasets.\n\nOverall, the set of metrics we reported is representative of the literature and provides a thorough evaluation of our models' performance. The high AUC values and the use of the Gini impurity index and ROC curves ensure that our findings are both robust and comparable to other studies in the field.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "Not applicable.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The performance metrics for the models developed in this study were evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) values, which exceeded 96% for all models. This high AUC indicates that the models are highly sensitive, specific, and robust, despite any experimental variations. The performance was comparable between the bortezomib- and dexamethasone-treatment models.\n\nTo ensure the reliability of the models, tenfold cross-validation was performed on the training dataset. This method helps in assessing the model's ability to generalize to an independent dataset. The relative effectiveness of each marker in separating the two classes (viable vs. apoptotic cells) was ranked according to the mean decrease in the Gini impurity index across all trees in the ensemble. This index reflects how accurate the groupings are, assessed by the activated caspase-3 (aCASP3) status.\n\nThe models were further tested against \"test datasets\" which included 20% of one run and two complete, independent technical replicates. The model predictions of each cell being apoptotic or viable were compared with its actual state based on the levels of aCASP3. The receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curves had area under the curve (AUC) values exceeding 96%, confirming the models' robustness and reliability across multiple experiments. These results suggest that the models are statistically significant and superior in distinguishing between viable and apoptotic cells following drug treatment.",
