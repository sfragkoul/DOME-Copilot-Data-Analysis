  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from elderly patients who were surgically treated for hip fractures at Dongying People\u2019s Hospital between April 2018 and April 2022. The study included a total of 532 patients, which exceeds the theoretically required sample size for statistical power and reliability.\n\nThe patients selected for the study met specific criteria: they were aged 65 years or older and had a first diagnosis of either a femoral neck fracture or an intertrochanteric fracture. The surgical procedures performed included artificial femoral head replacement, total hip replacement, or closed or open reduction and internal fixation. Patients with pathological fractures, open fractures, multiple injuries, a clear tumor history, or those who did not undergo surgical treatment were excluded from the study. Additionally, patients lost to follow-up or with incomplete information were not included.\n\nThis dataset has not been used in previous papers or by the community, as this study represents novel research in the field. The focus is on systematically screening independent risk factors for postoperative delirium (POD) in elderly patients with hip fractures and developing a nomogram prediction model using multiple machine learning methods. The dataset's large sample size and comprehensive inclusion of preoperative and intraoperative factors provide a robust foundation for the study's findings and the development of the prediction model.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into two main splits: a training group and a validation group. The training group contained approximately 70% of the total sample, which amounts to 372 data points. The validation group included the remaining 30%, totaling 160 data points. These splits were created following the principle of random allocation to ensure a balanced and representative distribution of data for both developing and validating the prediction model.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset consisted of 532 patients who were randomly allocated into two groups: a training group and a validation group. The training group comprised approximately 70% of the total sample, with 372 patients, while the validation group included the remaining 30%, totaling 160 patients. This split was designed to ensure that the training group was used for developing and validating the prediction model, while the validation group was used to assess the model's prediction performance and stability.\n\nThe random allocation process ensured that the training and validation sets were independent. This independence was crucial for evaluating the model's generalizability and performance on unseen data. The distribution of baseline features and preoperative and intraoperative indicators between the training and validation groups was compared, revealing no significant inter-group differences. This indicated that the random allocation effectively maintained the representativeness of the data in both groups.\n\nThe dataset's distribution compares favorably with previously published machine learning datasets in the medical field. The large sample size of 532 patients exceeded the theoretically required sample size for both extremes of delirium incidence rates, ensuring sufficient statistical power. This approach not only improved the reliability and applicability of the results but also provided a robust foundation for developing a high-precision prediction model. The use of multiple machine learning methods, including Lasso regression, support vector machine (SVM), and random forest, further enhanced the model's accuracy and comprehensiveness.",
  "dataset/availability": "Not applicable",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in this study leverages machine learning techniques to systematically identify and analyze risk factors associated with postoperative delirium (POD) in elderly patients with hip fractures. The machine-learning algorithms used belong to the class of supervised learning methods, specifically designed for feature selection and predictive modeling.\n\nThe algorithms utilized include Lasso regression, support vector machine (SVM), and random forest. These methods are well-established in the field of machine learning and are commonly used for handling medical data with multiple variables and nonlinear relationships. They are particularly effective in screening out key features that influence disease occurrence and developing high-precision prediction models.\n\nThe novelty of this study lies in the combination of these multiple machine learning methods to systematically screen out independent risk factors of POD in elderly patients with hip fractures. This approach has not been previously published in a machine-learning journal because the primary focus of this research is on its application in the medical field, specifically in the context of postoperative delirium prediction. The study aims to provide clinicians with a practical tool for early identification of high-risk patients, thereby improving prevention and management strategies.\n\nThe integration of these machine learning techniques allows for a comprehensive assessment of various preoperative and intraoperative factors, leading to the development of a more accurate risk prediction model. This model has been validated through internal and external assessments, demonstrating its reliability and applicability in clinical settings. The use of these established algorithms ensures that the findings are robust and can be replicated in different clinical environments.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model developed in this study is not a meta-predictor. It does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it employs multiple machine learning methods to systematically screen out the independent risk factors of postoperative delirium (POD) in elderly patients with hip fractures (HF). The methods used include Lasso regression, support vector machine (SVM), and random forest. These methods were applied to identify key features affecting the occurrence of delirium. The common features screened out by these methods were then used to develop a predictive model.\n\nThe training data for the model was collected from elderly patients with HF who were surgically treated at Dongying People\u2019s Hospital from April 2018 to April 2022. The sample size exceeded the theoretically required sample size, ensuring sufficient statistical power and improving the reliability and applicability of the results. The model was validated both internally and externally, demonstrating excellent discriminatory capacity and clinical benefits within specific risk threshold ranges. The use of multiple machine learning techniques provided a comprehensive assessment of the model\u2019s performance, ensuring that the results are robust and reliable.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure the data was suitable for analysis. Initially, the dataset included various clinical and perioperative variables. These variables were selected based on their potential relevance to the occurrence of postoperative delirium (POD) in elderly patients with hip fractures.\n\nCategorical variables, such as the mode of anesthesia and the presence of postoperative ICU care, were encoded using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding to convert them into a numerical format that the machine-learning algorithms could process. Continuous variables, such as age, preoperative RBC count, preoperative albumin levels, and intraoperative blood loss, were standardized or normalized to ensure they were on a similar scale, which is crucial for algorithms like support vector machines (SVM) and random forests.\n\nMissing values were handled through imputation methods, where appropriate, to maintain the integrity of the dataset. This involved filling in missing data points with the mean, median, or mode of the respective variable, depending on the distribution of the data.\n\nFeature scaling was applied to normalize the range of continuous variables, which helps in improving the performance and convergence of the machine-learning models. This step is particularly important for algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of the input features, such as SVM and Lasso regression.\n\nThe dataset was then split into training and validation sets to evaluate the performance of the models. The training set was used to develop the models, while the validation set was used to assess their predictive accuracy and generalizability. This split ensured that the models were tested on unseen data, providing a more reliable estimate of their performance in real-world scenarios.\n\nIn summary, the data encoding and preprocessing involved converting categorical variables into numerical formats, handling missing values, scaling continuous variables, and splitting the dataset into training and validation sets. These steps were essential to prepare the data for effective analysis using machine-learning algorithms.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized six key parameters to construct our risk prediction model for postoperative delirium (POD) in elderly patients with hip fractures. These parameters were selected through a systematic process involving multiple machine learning techniques.\n\nInitially, we employed Lasso regression, support vector machine (SVM), and random forest methods to screen potential risk factors. Lasso regression identified several features, including age, cognitive impairment history, walking ability before injury, and various preoperative and intraoperative factors. The SVM method highlighted age, preoperative albumin, platelet count, red blood cell count, hemoglobin, intraoperative blood loss, and cognitive impairment history as significant. The random forest method screened out a broader set of features, including age, body mass index, gender, cognitive impairment history, and several preoperative and intraoperative factors.\n\nTo determine the most relevant parameters, we performed a Venn diagram analysis, which revealed seven common features across the three methods: age, cognitive impairment history, preoperative red blood cell count, preoperative albumin, preoperative hemoglobin, preoperative platelet count, and intraoperative blood loss.\n\nSubsequently, we conducted a risk factor analysis on these seven characteristic factors. Univariate analysis identified age, preoperative red blood cell count, preoperative albumin, preoperative hemoglobin, preoperative platelet count, and intraoperative blood loss as risk factors for POD. Multivariate analysis further confirmed these six factors as independent risk factors affecting POD.\n\nTherefore, the final model was developed using these six parameters: age, preoperative red blood cell count, preoperative albumin, preoperative hemoglobin, preoperative platelet count, and intraoperative blood loss. This selection process ensured that our model incorporated the most relevant and significant factors for predicting POD in elderly patients with hip fractures.",
  "optimization/features": "In the optimization process, seven features were used as input. Feature selection was indeed performed to identify the most relevant predictors. This selection process was conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the validation set remained independent for unbiased evaluation. Three different methods\u2014Lasso regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and random forest\u2014were employed to screen and identify the key features. The common features identified by all three methods were then used to develop the predictive model. These features include age, cognitive impairment history, preoperative red blood cell count, preoperative albumin, preoperative hemoglobin, preoperative platelet count, and intraoperative blood loss. This rigorous feature selection process helped in enhancing the model's predictive accuracy and reliability.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study utilized multiple machine learning techniques to systematically screen out independent risk factors for postoperative delirium (POD) in elderly patients with hip fractures. The methods included Lasso regression, support vector machine (SVM), and random forest, which are well-suited for handling medical data with multiple variables and nonlinear relationships.\n\nThe number of parameters considered in the model was indeed larger than the number of training points, which could potentially lead to overfitting. To mitigate this risk, several strategies were implemented. First, the use of Lasso regression inherently performs feature selection by penalizing the absolute size of the regression coefficients, which helps in reducing the complexity of the model and preventing overfitting. Second, the model's performance was validated through both internal and external validation processes. The area under the curve (AUC) values for the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were 0.833 in the training group and 0.850 in the validation group, indicating strong discriminatory capacity. Additionally, precision-recall curves and calibration curves were used to assess the model's precision and the agreement between predicted probabilities and actual incidence rates, respectively. Decision curve analysis (DCA) further confirmed the clinical benefits of the model within specified risk threshold ranges.\n\nTo ensure that the model was not underfitting, the study included a comprehensive set of features that were identified through multiple machine learning methods. The Venn diagram analysis helped in identifying seven common features that were significant across all methods: age, cognitive impairment history, preoperative red blood cell (RBC) count, preoperative albumin (ALB), preoperative hemoglobin (Hb), preoperative platelet (PLT) count, and intraoperative blood loss (IBL). These features were then subjected to univariate and multivariate analyses to confirm their significance as risk factors for POD. The final model incorporated these six characteristic factors, providing a robust and accurate prediction of POD risk. The risk score calculation formula was derived from these factors, ensuring that the model captured the essential variables influencing POD occurrence.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed Lasso regression as a regularization method to prevent overfitting. This technique is particularly useful in scenarios with a large number of variables, as it helps in feature selection by shrinking the coefficients of less important features to zero. By doing so, Lasso regression not only simplifies the model but also enhances its generalization capability, making it more robust and less prone to overfitting. This approach was crucial in identifying the key features that significantly influence the occurrence of postoperative delirium in elderly patients with hip fractures.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in this study is not a blackbox but rather a transparent and interpretable nomogram prediction model. This model was constructed based on six independent risk factors: age, preoperative red blood cell (RBC) count, preoperative albumin (ALB), preoperative hemoglobin (Hb), preoperative platelet (PLT) count, and intraoperative blood loss (IBL). Each of these factors contributes to the overall risk score, which can be easily calculated using the provided formula.\n\nThe risk score calculation formula is as follows: 5.461 + age \u00d7 0.126 + preoperative RBC count \u00d7 -1.101 + preoperative ALB \u00d7 -0.218 + preoperative Hb \u00d7 -0.035 + preoperative PLT \u00d7 -0.014 + IBL 200 \u00d7 0.582 + IBL 300 \u00d7 0.891 + IBL 400 \u00d7 1.494. This formula allows clinicians to understand how each factor influences the risk of postoperative delirium (POD). For example, an increase in age or intraoperative blood loss increases the risk score, while higher preoperative RBC count, albumin, hemoglobin, and platelet count decrease the risk score.\n\nThe nomogram visually represents these factors and their respective contributions to the risk of POD. This visual representation makes it easy for clinicians to assess the risk for individual patients by simply locating the value for each factor on the corresponding axis and summing the points to obtain a total risk score. The total risk score can then be used to estimate the probability of POD occurrence.\n\nFurthermore, the model's performance was validated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, precision-recall curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.833 in the training group and 0.850 in the validation group indicate the model's excellent discriminatory capacity. The calibration curves showed a good agreement between predicted and actual probabilities, and the DCA confirmed clinical net benefits within specific risk thresholds.\n\nIn summary, the nomogram prediction model is transparent and interpretable, providing clear insights into the factors influencing POD risk. This transparency allows clinicians to make informed decisions and take appropriate intervention measures to improve patients' postoperative prognosis and reduce the incidence of delirium.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a classification model. It is designed to predict the occurrence of postoperative delirium (POD) in elderly patients with hip fractures. The model uses a nomogram based on six characteristic factors: age, preoperative red blood cell count, preoperative albumin, preoperative hemoglobin, preoperative platelet count, and intraoperative blood loss. These factors were identified through multivariate analysis as independent risk factors affecting POD. The model's performance was evaluated using various metrics, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), which was 0.833 in the training group and 0.850 in the validation group. These values indicate that the model has excellent discriminatory capacity and is effective in classifying patients into high-risk and low-risk categories for POD. The precision-recall curves and calibration curves further support the model's precision and consistency in predicting POD. Additionally, the decision curve analysis showed that the model has clinical benefits within specific risk threshold ranges, demonstrating its practical utility in clinical settings.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method employed for the risk model involved both internal and external validation processes. Initially, the model was validated within the training group, where it demonstrated excellent discriminatory capacity with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.833. This was further supported by the precision-recall curve, which showed the model's precision at various true positive rates, maintaining high precision even at higher recall rates. The calibration curve indicated a strong agreement between the predicted probabilities and the actual incidence rates. Additionally, the decision curve analysis (DCA) revealed clinical benefits within a risk threshold range of 0%-30%.\n\nSubsequently, the model was validated in an independent validation group. Here, the AUC of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.850, confirming the model's robust discriminatory ability. The precision-recall curve in this group also showed stable precision at higher recall rates. The calibration curve again demonstrated good agreement between predicted and actual outcomes. The DCA for the validation group indicated clinical benefits within a slightly broader risk threshold range of 0%-36%.\n\nThese validation steps ensured that the model's performance was consistent and reliable across different datasets, providing a strong foundation for its clinical applicability.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our predictive model for postoperative delirium (POD), several key performance metrics were reported to assess its effectiveness and reliability.\n\nThe primary metric used was the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The AUC values were 0.833 for the training group and 0.850 for the validation group, indicating strong discriminatory capacity. These values are comparable to those reported in similar studies, such as the model by Zhang et al., which had AUCs of 0.836 and 0.817 for the training and validation sets, respectively. While the model by Chen et al. achieved a higher AUC of 0.94 using machine learning methods, our model demonstrates competitive performance.\n\nAdditionally, precision-recall curves were utilized to evaluate the model's precision at different recall rates. The curves showed that the model maintained high precision, especially at higher recall rates, in both the training and validation groups. This metric is crucial for understanding the model's performance in clinical settings where the cost of false positives and false negatives can vary significantly.\n\nCalibration curves were also presented to assess the agreement between the predicted probabilities and the actual incidence rates. The curves indicated a favorable consistency, suggesting that the model's predictions are reliable and well-calibrated.\n\nDecision Curve Analysis (DCA) was employed to evaluate the clinical benefit of the model. The DCA curves showed that the model provides clinical benefits within specific risk threshold ranges\u20140% to 30% for the training group and 0% to 36% for the validation group. This analysis is essential for determining the practical utility of the model in real-world clinical scenarios.\n\nOverall, the reported metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance, covering aspects such as discriminatory ability, precision, calibration, and clinical utility. These metrics are representative of those commonly used in the literature for evaluating predictive models in healthcare, ensuring that our findings are comparable and relevant to existing research.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In the evaluation of our study, we conducted a comprehensive comparison of baseline features and preoperative and intraoperative indicators between the training and validation groups. This comparison was crucial for assessing the robustness and generalizability of our findings. The training group consisted of 372 patients, while the validation group included 160 patients, both allocated randomly.\n\nThe comparison revealed no significant inter-group differences in most factors, including delirium status, gender, fracture type, cognitive impairment history, smoking history, preoperative comorbidities, number of comorbidities, hypertension, diabetes, COPD, walking ability before injury, ASA grading, anesthesia mode, RBC transfusion of \u2265 2 units, postoperative ICU care, age, BMI, preoperative RBC count, preoperative WBC, preoperative ALB, preoperative SCr, preoperative Hb, preoperative PLT, time from admission to surgery, OT, and IBL. These results indicate that the baseline characteristics and preoperative and intraoperative indicators were well-balanced between the two groups, ensuring that any observed differences in outcomes could be attributed to the variables under study rather than to differences in patient characteristics.\n\nWe also validated our risk model using various metrics, including the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, precision-recall curve, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis. The ROC curve demonstrated the model's discriminatory capacity, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.833 in the training group and 0.850 in the validation group. The precision-recall curve showed the model's precision at different precision-recall rates, while the calibration curve illustrated the relationship between the predicted probability and the actual incidence rate. The decision curve analysis indicated that the model has clinical benefits within specific risk threshold ranges, further validating its practical utility.\n\nWhile we did not perform a direct comparison to publicly available methods on benchmark datasets, the internal validation and the comprehensive comparison between the training and validation groups provide strong evidence of the model's reliability and applicability. The absence of significant inter-group differences in baseline characteristics and preoperative and intraoperative indicators supports the conclusion that our model is robust and generalizable.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The performance metrics of the risk model developed in this study include confidence intervals, providing a measure of the uncertainty around the estimates. The area under the curve (AUC) for the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve in the training group is 0.833 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.774-0.888, indicating excellent discriminatory capacity. Similarly, the AUC in the validation group is 0.850 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.718-0.982, demonstrating good discriminatory ability.\n\nThe precision-recall curves further exhibit the model's precision at different true positive rates, maintaining relatively high precision at higher recall rates in both the training and validation groups. The calibration curves reveal a favorable consistency between the predicted probability and the actual incidence rate, suggesting that the model's predictions are reliable.\n\nThe decision curve analysis (DCA) curves indicate clinical benefits within specific risk threshold ranges. In the training group, the model shows clinical benefits within a risk threshold range of 0%-30%, while in the validation group, the benefits extend to a range of 0%-36%. These results suggest that the model has practical value in clinical settings.\n\nStatistical significance is demonstrated in various comparisons. For instance, significant differences were found in age, number of comorbidities, and ASA grading between the delirium and non-delirium groups. Additionally, preoperative red blood cell (RBC) count, albumin (ALB), hemoglobin (Hb), platelet (PLT) count, intraoperative blood loss (IBL), RBC transfusion of \u2265 2 units, and postoperative ICU care were statistically different between the groups.\n\nThe risk factors identified through univariate and multivariate analyses are statistically significant. Age, preoperative RBC count, ALB, Hb, PLT, and IBL were found to be independent risk factors affecting postoperative delirium (POD) in patients. The odds ratios and p-values for these factors indicate their significance in predicting POD.\n\nOverall, the performance metrics and statistical analyses provide strong evidence of the model's effectiveness and reliability in predicting POD. The inclusion of confidence intervals and the demonstration of statistical significance enhance the confidence in the model's superiority over other methods and baselines.",
