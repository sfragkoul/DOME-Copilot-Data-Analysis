  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in our study is the random forest algorithm. This is a well-established ensemble learning method known for its robustness and accuracy in handling complex datasets.\n\nThe random forest algorithm is not new; it has been extensively used and validated in various fields, including bioinformatics and cancer research. The decision to use this algorithm was driven by its proven effectiveness in classification tasks and its ability to handle high-dimensional data, which is characteristic of genomic and transcriptomic studies.\n\nGiven that the random forest algorithm is widely recognized and has been thoroughly documented in the literature, there was no need to publish it in a machine-learning journal. Instead, our focus was on applying this established method to address specific questions in cancer research, particularly in the context of RNA methylation regulators and their role in neoadjuvant therapy. The algorithm's implementation and optimization were tailored to our dataset and research objectives, ensuring that it provided reliable and meaningful results for our study.",
  "optimization/meta": "In our study, we employed a random forest model as part of our machine learning approach. This model utilized the normalized expression matrix of 46 RNA methylation regulators (RMRs) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) samples. The random forest model demonstrated high predictive accuracy, with a value of 0.91, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve exceeding 0.9 in tenfold cross-validation for classifying three pairs of clusters. This indicates that the model is both accurate and robust.\n\nThe random forest model itself is not a meta-predictor, as it does not combine the predictions of other machine-learning algorithms. Instead, it is a standalone algorithm that uses decision trees to make predictions. The training data for the random forest model consisted of the normalized expression matrix of RMRs, ensuring that the data was independent and specifically tailored to the task of classifying different clusters based on RNA methylation dynamics.\n\nThe importance of each regulator's contribution to the model was assessed by calculating its importance score. Notably, the m5C writer NOP2 was identified as a significant contributor. This analysis helped in understanding the key regulators involved in the model's predictions.\n\nIn summary, our approach involved using a random forest model trained on independent data from TCGA samples, focusing on the expression of RMRs to achieve accurate and robust predictions.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps. Initially, the expression data of 46 RNA methylation regulators (RMRs) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) samples were normalized. This normalization process included median centering the expression values for each RMR to ensure consistency across different cancer types. The normalized expression matrix was then used to train a random forest model. The feature matrix consisted of the median-centered expression data of the 46 RMRs, with the samples categorized into three clusters as the outcome variable. The random forest algorithm was optimized using tenfold cross-validation and parameter tuning to enhance predictive accuracy. Additionally, the importance of each regulator in the model was calculated to assess their contribution to the classification task. This preprocessing ensured that the data was standardized and suitable for robust model training and validation.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized a random forest model for classification, and the number of parameters, p, corresponds to the number of features used in the model. Specifically, we used the normalized expression matrix of 46 RNA methylation regulators (RMRs) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) samples. These 46 RMRs were classified into writers, readers, and erasers from m6A, m5C, m1A, and m7G categories.\n\nThe selection of these 46 RMRs was based on an extensive literature search and their known roles in RNA methylation modification. The feature matrix consisted of the median-centered expression data of these 46 RMRs. The model was trained using the caret R package, and the training algorithm was optimized via tenfold cross-validation resampling method. The parameter range was set to be less than the number of features, ensuring that the model was not overfitted. This approach allowed us to determine the optimal parameters for the random forest model, ensuring both accuracy and robustness in classifying the three pairs of clusters.",
  "optimization/features": "The input features for our model consist of the normalized expression data of 46 RNA methylation regulators (RMRs). These RMRs were identified through an extensive literature search and include regulators for m6A, m1A, m5C, and m7G methylation types. The expression data was obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) samples and was median-centered before being used as input features.\n\nFeature selection was not explicitly performed in the traditional sense, as all 46 RMRs were included in the analysis. However, the importance of each regulator's contribution to the model was assessed by calculating its importance score. This process helped in understanding the significance of each RMR in the predictive model.\n\nThe normalization and median-centering of the RMR expression data were conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the feature engineering process did not introduce any bias from the test set. This approach maintains the integrity of the model validation process.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study involved the use of a random forest model, which is known for its robustness and ability to handle high-dimensional data. The feature matrix consisted of the median-centered expression data of 46 RNA methylation regulators (RMRs) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) samples. The outcome variable was the clustering of these samples into three distinct groups.\n\nGiven that the number of features (46 RMRs) is relatively small compared to the number of training points (TCGA samples), the risk of overfitting is mitigated. However, to further ensure the model's generalizability, tenfold cross-validation was implemented. This technique involves partitioning the data into ten subsets, training the model on nine subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated ten times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) was calculated and plotted for each fold, demonstrating the model's consistent performance across different data splits.\n\nTo address potential underfitting, the random forest algorithm's parameters were optimized using a tenfold cross-validation resampling method. This approach helps in tuning the model to achieve a balance between bias and variance, ensuring that it captures the underlying patterns in the data without being too simplistic. The predictive accuracy of the model was determined to be 0.91, and the AUC-ROC exceeded 0.9 for the classification of the three clusters, indicating strong model performance.\n\nAdditionally, the importance of each regulator's contribution to the model was calculated, providing insights into the key features driving the classification. This step not only aids in interpreting the model but also helps in identifying critical RMRs that play significant roles in the clustering of cancer samples.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our models. One of the key methods used was tenfold cross-validation. This technique involves dividing the dataset into ten subsets, training the model on nine of these subsets, and validating it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated ten times, with each subset serving as the validation set once. By averaging the results, we obtained a more reliable estimate of the model's performance and reduced the risk of overfitting.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized the random forest algorithm, which inherently provides a form of regularization through the ensemble of decision trees. Each tree in the forest is trained on a different bootstrap sample of the data, and only a random subset of features is considered for splitting at each node. This approach helps to reduce overfitting by ensuring that the model does not become too dependent on any single feature or data point.\n\nFurthermore, we optimized the parameters of our random forest model using a tenfold cross-validation resampling method. This involved systematically searching through a range of parameter values to find the combination that yielded the best performance on the validation sets. By doing so, we ensured that our model was not only accurate but also generalizable to new, unseen data.\n\nIn summary, our use of tenfold cross-validation, the random forest algorithm, and parameter optimization collectively helped to mitigate overfitting and enhance the reliability of our predictive models.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in our study is not a black box but rather a transparent one, as it allows for the interpretation of individual feature contributions. To achieve this transparency, we calculated the importance score for each regulator, which quantifies the value of each regulator's contribution to the model. This approach enables us to identify key regulators that significantly influence the model's predictions.\n\nFor instance, the m5C writer NOP2 was notably highlighted as a crucial regulator in our analysis. By examining the importance scores, we can gain insights into which regulators are most influential in determining the clustering of samples. This transparency is essential for understanding the underlying biological mechanisms and for validating the model's predictions with domain knowledge.\n\nAdditionally, the use of random forest models inherently provides some level of interpretability. Random forests consist of multiple decision trees, and each tree provides a pathway of decisions based on the input features. By analyzing these decision paths, one can understand how different features interact and contribute to the final prediction. This feature is particularly useful in biological research, where understanding the interplay between different regulators is crucial.\n\nFurthermore, the model's performance was evaluated using tenfold cross-validation, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve exceeded 0.9 for the classification of clusters. This high performance, combined with the interpretability of the importance scores, ensures that the model is both accurate and transparent. Researchers can thus trust the model's predictions and use the importance scores to guide further experimental validation and biological insights.",

The predictive accuracy of the model was determined to be 0.91, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in the tenfold cross-validation exceeded 0.9 for the classification of the three pairs of clusters.
