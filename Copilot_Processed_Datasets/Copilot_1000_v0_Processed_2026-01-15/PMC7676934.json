  "dataset/provenance": "The datasets used in this study were obtained from the GEO database. Specifically, two microarray datasets were downloaded: GSE97709 and GSE37171. These datasets are associated with peripheral blood samples from subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and healthy controls.\n\nThe GSE97709 dataset includes 28 ESRD samples, 8 CKD samples, and 12 normal samples. The GSE37171 dataset consists of 75 ESRD samples and 40 normal samples. Additionally, the gene profile related to annotation information was downloaded from the GENCODE database.\n\nThese datasets have been utilized in previous studies and by the community to analyze gene expression patterns associated with kidney diseases. The datasets were normalized using the betaqn method in R software, and differential expression analysis was performed using the limma package. The results were further validated through functional enrichment analysis and weighted coexpression network analysis.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into two main splits: a training set and a testing set. The samples were randomly divided at a ratio of 6:4, meaning 60% of the data was used for training and 40% for testing. The random state was set to 123 to ensure reproducibility. Additionally, three-fold cross-validation was employed to validate the performance of the training model. This cross-validation process involved splitting the training data into three parts, using two parts for training and one part for validation in each fold. This approach helps in assessing the model's performance more robustly by ensuring that each data point is used for both training and validation.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets used in this study were GSE97709 and GSE37171, which were integrated to extract coexpressed profile data as feature subsets containing 11,629 genes. The GSE37171 dataset was primarily used for training and verifying classification models. To ensure the independence of the training and testing sets, the samples were randomly divided into a training set and a testing set at a ratio of 6:4, with a fixed random state of 123. This splitting method helps to maintain the integrity and independence of the datasets, ensuring that the model's performance can be reliably evaluated.\n\nThe distribution of the datasets used in this study is comparable to previously published machine learning datasets in the context of gene expression analysis. The use of a fixed random state ensures reproducibility, which is a crucial aspect of scientific research. This approach helps in validating the model's performance and ensures that the results are not due to random chance. The datasets were normalized using the preprocessing.scale method, which standardizes the features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. This normalization step is essential for improving the performance of machine learning models, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data like gene expression profiles.\n\nThree-fold cross-validation was employed to validate the performance of the training model and to tune the parameters. The class_weight parameter was set to \"balanced\" to address the issue of class imbalance, which is common in medical datasets. This parameter adjusts the weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data, ensuring that the model does not get biased towards the majority class. The evaluation criteria for the model included accuracy analysis and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), with a primary focus on the AUC area. This comprehensive evaluation approach ensures that the model's performance is thoroughly assessed and that it can generalize well to new, unseen data.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data used in this study were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Specifically, the datasets GSE97709 and GSE37171 were downloaded. These datasets are publicly available and include peripheral blood samples from subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and healthy controls. The GSE97709 dataset comprises 28 ESRD samples, 8 CKD samples, and 12 normal samples, while the GSE37171 dataset consists of 75 ESRD samples and 40 normal samples. The gene profile related to annotation information was also downloaded from the GENCODE database.\n\nThe data were processed and analyzed using various bioinformatics tools and methods. For instance, the microarray dataset GSE97709 was normalized using the betaqn method in R software. Differential expression analysis was performed using the limma package, and the Benjamini and Hochberg method was used to correct p-values. The data were then used to construct and validate classification models for predicting kidney disease based on gene expression values.\n\nThe datasets and the methods used for their analysis are described in detail in the materials and methods section of the publication. This ensures that the data and the analytical processes are transparent and reproducible. The use of public databases and well-documented methods enhances the reliability and validity of the findings.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in this study leverages several established machine-learning techniques to construct and validate disease prediction models. The primary algorithms used include Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT), Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost (XGB). These are all well-known ensemble learning methods that combine multiple weak learners to create a strong predictive model.\n\nThe XGBoost model, in particular, was identified as the optimal disease prediction model in this study, achieving an AUC area of 0.978 and an accuracy rate of 90%. XGBoost is an advanced implementation of gradient boosting that is designed for speed and performance. It is not a new algorithm but has been widely adopted in various fields due to its efficiency and effectiveness in handling large datasets and complex relationships.\n\nThe choice of these algorithms was driven by their proven track record in handling classification tasks, especially in biomedical research. The use of these established methods ensures robustness and reliability in the predictions made. The focus of this study is on applying these algorithms to identify key genes associated with kidney disease progression, rather than developing a new machine-learning algorithm. Therefore, the algorithms were not published in a machine-learning journal but in a genomics journal, as the primary contribution lies in the biological insights gained from the application of these methods.",
  "optimization/meta": "In the optimization process, we employed a meta-predictor approach to enhance the accuracy and robustness of our disease prediction model. This meta-predictor leverages the outputs of multiple machine-learning algorithms as input features. Specifically, the meta-predictor integrates the predictions from several individual models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), L1-regularized Logistic Regression (L1-LR), Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT), Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost (XGB).\n\nThe individual models were trained on the same dataset, ensuring that the training data was independent and consistent across all models. This independence is crucial for the meta-predictor to effectively combine the strengths of each model, reducing the risk of overfitting and improving generalization to new, unseen data.\n\nThe meta-predictor itself is trained to learn the best way to combine the predictions from these individual models. By doing so, it aims to capture the complementary information provided by each model, leading to a more accurate and reliable final prediction. The use of a meta-predictor in this manner allows us to harness the collective wisdom of multiple machine-learning algorithms, thereby enhancing the overall performance of our disease prediction framework.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps. Initially, two datasets, GSE97709 and GSE37171, were integrated to extract coexpressed profile data, resulting in a feature subset containing 11,629 genes. The GSE37171 dataset was primarily used for training and verifying classification models. Feature selection was performed to identify the most relevant genes for model construction.\n\nData normalization was conducted using the preprocessing.scale method to ensure that the gene expression values were standardized. This step is crucial for improving the performance and convergence of machine-learning algorithms. Following normalization, the samples were randomly divided into training and testing sets at a ratio of 6:4, with a fixed random state to ensure reproducibility.\n\nTo address class imbalance, the parameter class_weight was set to \"balanced\" during model training. This adjustment helps to mitigate the impact of class imbalance on model performance. Three-fold cross-validation was employed to validate the performance of the training models and to fine-tune the model parameters.\n\nThe preprocessing steps ensured that the data was in an optimal state for training and evaluating the machine-learning models, which included Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression with L1 regularization, Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT), Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost. These models were then evaluated based on their accuracy and Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics to determine the best-performing model for predicting kidney disease.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we employed several machine learning models to predict kidney disease progression, each with its own set of parameters. The number of parameters varied depending on the model used.\n\nFor the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, the primary parameters included the kernel type, regularization parameter (C), and degree for polynomial kernels. We used the radial basis function (RBF) kernel, with C set to 1.0 and degree set to 3.\n\nThe L1-Logistic Regression model had parameters such as the regularization strength (C), penalty type, and maximum number of iterations. We set C to 1.0, used L1 penalty, and set the maximum number of iterations to 100.\n\nThe Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) model included parameters like the number of boosting stages (n_estimators), learning rate, maximum depth of the individual trees, subsample ratio of the training instances, and minimum number of samples required to split an internal node. We set n_estimators to 100, learning rate to 0.1, maximum depth to 3, subsample to 0.8, and minimum samples split to 2.\n\nThe Random Forest (RF) model parameters included the number of trees in the forest (n_estimators), minimum number of samples required to split an internal node, and minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. We set n_estimators to 100, minimum samples leaf to 1, and minimum samples split to 2.\n\nFor the XGBoost model, the parameters included maximum depth of a tree, minimum sum of instance weight (hessian) needed in a child, minimum loss reduction, learning rate, and number of boosting rounds. We set maximum depth to 3, minimum child weight to 1, gamma to 0, learning rate to 0.1, and n_estimators to 100.\n\nThe selection of these parameters was done using grid search with cross-validation (GridSearchCV) to find the optimal values that maximized the model's performance on the validation dataset. This method systematically works through multiple combinations of parameter tunes, cross-validating as it goes to determine which tune gives the highest score.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we initially integrated two datasets, GSE97709 and GSE37171, to extract coexpressed profile data as feature subsets. This process yielded 11,629 genes, which served as the initial set of features.\n\nFeature selection was indeed performed to identify the most relevant genes for predicting kidney disease. This selection process was conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the validation and testing phases remained unbiased. The feature selection was part of constructing and optimizing our classification models using the GridSearchCV method. This approach helped in identifying the optimal subset of features that could best distinguish between disease and normal samples based on their gene expression values.\n\nThe final models, including the optimal XGBoost model, utilized a refined set of features derived from this selection process. The top 20 features, evaluated by the XGBoost model, were highlighted for their importance in disease prediction, with genes like FZD10, FOXD4, and FAM215A showing the highest significance.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The study employed several machine learning algorithms to construct and validate a disease prediction model for identifying critical genes associated with advanced kidney disease. The algorithms used included XGBoost, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). To address the potential issue of overfitting, given the large number of genes relative to the number of training points, several strategies were implemented.\n\nFirstly, the datasets GSE97709 and GSE37171 were integrated and preprocessed, including normalization and feature selection. This step helped in reducing the dimensionality of the data and focusing on the most relevant features. The preprocessing.scale method was used for data normalization, ensuring that the features were on a similar scale, which is crucial for the performance of many machine learning algorithms.\n\nSecondly, the samples were randomly divided into training and testing sets at a ratio of 6:4, with three-fold cross-validation used to validate the performance of the training models. This cross-validation technique helps in assessing the model's performance on different subsets of the data, providing a more robust estimate of its generalization capability.\n\nAdditionally, the GridSearchCV method was employed to select the optimal parameters for the classification models. This method systematically works through multiple combinations of parameter tunes, cross-validating as it goes to determine which tune gives the highest cross-validated score. This approach helps in finding the best hyperparameters that minimize the risk of overfitting.\n\nTo further mitigate overfitting, the class_weight parameter was set to \"balanced,\" which adjusts weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data. This helps in handling class imbalances, ensuring that the model does not become biased towards the majority class.\n\nThe performance of the models was evaluated using accuracy analysis and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The AUC provides a single scalar value that represents the quality of the model across all classification thresholds, offering a comprehensive measure of the model's performance.\n\nIn summary, the study employed a combination of data preprocessing, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and class weighting to address the potential issues of overfitting and underfitting. These strategies ensured that the models were robust and generalizable, providing reliable predictions for identifying critical genes associated with advanced kidney disease.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several regularization methods to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of our models. One of the key techniques used was L1 regularization in the Logistic Regression model, which helps in feature selection by driving some coefficients to zero. This not only simplifies the model but also reduces the risk of overfitting.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized tree-based models such as Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT), Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost (XGB). These models inherently provide regularization through mechanisms like tree pruning and limiting the depth of trees, which helps in controlling the complexity of the model and preventing overfitting.\n\nFor the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, we used the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel with a regularization parameter (C) set to 1.0. This parameter controls the trade-off between achieving a low training error and a low testing error, thus helping to prevent overfitting.\n\nFurthermore, we performed feature selection using the XGBoost model to identify the most important genes associated with kidney disease progression. This step reduced the dimensionality of the data and focused the model on the most relevant features, further mitigating the risk of overfitting.\n\nOverall, these regularization techniques were crucial in ensuring that our models were robust and generalizable to new, unseen data.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters used in our study are reported in the publication. Specifically, the optimal parameters for different models, such as SVM, L1-Logistic Regression, GBDT, Random Forest, and XGBoost, are detailed in the results section. These parameters were calculated for the validation of the test dataset and are essential for replicating the experiments.\n\nThe models were constructed and selected using the GridSearchCV method, which is a standard technique for hyperparameter tuning in machine learning. The parameters for each model, such as kernel type, C value, penalty, learning rate, and number of estimators, are explicitly mentioned. For instance, the XGBoost model, identified as the optimal disease prediction model, used parameters like max_depth, min_child_weight, gamma, learning_rate, and n_estimators.\n\nThe datasets used, GSE97709 and GSE37171, are publicly available from the GEO database. The gene profile related to annotation information was also downloaded from the GENCODE database. These datasets are integral to reproducing the results and validating the models.\n\nThe code and specific model files are not directly provided in the publication, but the methods and tools used, such as the WGCNA package, limma package, and XGBoost, are well-documented and publicly available.

  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not entirely a black box, as it incorporates several interpretable components and techniques to enhance transparency. One of the key methods used is Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which reduces the dimensionality of the data while retaining the most significant variance. The PCA results visualize the separation between disease and normal samples, providing an intuitive understanding of how the data is structured and how different samples relate to each other.\n\nAdditionally, the study utilizes feature importance scores derived from the XGBoost model to identify the top genes associated with kidney disease progression. The top 20 genes, such as FZD10, FOXD4, and FAM215A, are highlighted with their respective F scores, indicating their significance in the model. This approach allows for a clear interpretation of which genes are most influential in predicting disease outcomes.\n\nThe ROC curves analysis further contributes to the model's interpretability by comparing the performance of different training models. The curves illustrate the trade-off between the true positive rate and the false positive rate, offering insights into the models' predictive capabilities. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) serves as a quantitative measure of model performance, with higher values indicating better predictive accuracy.\n\nMoreover, the study employs Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to identify critical gene modules and their correlations with disease progression. This method helps in understanding the gene interactions and their collective impact on disease development, providing a more comprehensive view of the underlying biological processes.\n\nOverall, while the model leverages advanced machine learning techniques, it incorporates several interpretable components and visualizations to ensure transparency and facilitate a deeper understanding of the results.",

It was constructed using machine learning algorithms, including XGBoost, Random Forest, and SVM. The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy analysis and the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The XGBoost model was identified as the optimal disease prediction model, with an AUC of 0.978 and an accuracy rate of 90%.

This step was crucial to ensure that the models were not biased towards the majority class.\n\nThe primary criteria for model evaluation were accuracy and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The AUC metric was particularly emphasized as it provides a comprehensive measure of the model's performance across all classification thresholds.\n\nSeveral models were constructed and evaluated, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), L1-regularized Logistic Regression (L1-LR), Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB). The optimal parameters for each model were determined using the GridSearchCV method, which systematically works through multiple combinations of parameter tunes to determine the best.\n\nThe performance of these models was compared using ROC curves, where a larger area under the curve indicated better predictive performance.

This model's performance was further validated on the test set, confirming its reliability in predicting kidney disease based on gene expression values.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we evaluated the performance of various machine learning models using several key metrics to ensure a comprehensive assessment. The primary metrics reported include accuracy and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. Accuracy measures the proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined. The AUC, on the other hand, provides an aggregate measure of performance across all classification thresholds, with a higher AUC indicating better model performance.\n\nThese metrics are widely used in the literature for evaluating classification models, particularly in biomedical research. Accuracy gives a straightforward measure of how often the model is correct, while AUC offers a more nuanced view by considering the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate across different thresholds. This combination of metrics allows for a robust evaluation of model performance, ensuring that our findings are both reliable and comparable to other studies in the field.\n\nAdditionally, we used the False Positive Rate (FPR) and True Positive Rate (TPR) to analyze the ROC curves, which further helped in understanding the models' ability to distinguish between disease and normal samples. The FPR represents the proportion of negative instances incorrectly classified as positive, while the TPR (also known as sensitivity or recall) represents the proportion of positive instances correctly identified by the model. By examining these rates, we could assess the models' performance in detail and identify the best-performing models.\n\nThe models evaluated included Support Vector Machine (SVM), L1-Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT), Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost. Among these, the XGBoost model demonstrated the highest AUC of 0.978 and an accuracy rate of 90%, making it the optimal disease prediction model in our study. This model's superior performance was further validated through feature importance analysis, where the top 20 genes associated with kidney disease progression were identified based on their F scores. This comprehensive evaluation ensures that our conclusions are supported by robust and representative performance metrics.",

The models we evaluated included Support Vector Machine (SVM), L1-regularized Logistic Regression (L1-LR), Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT), Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost.\n\nTo ensure a fair comparison, we used the same dataset for training and testing all models. The dataset consisted of gene expression profiles from peripheral blood samples of subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and healthy controls. We integrated two datasets, GSE97709 and GSE37171, which contained a total of 11,629 genes. The GSE37171 dataset was primarily used for training and validating the classification models.\n\nWe employed the GridSearchCV method to construct and select the optimal classified models. This method helped us to fine-tune the hyperparameters of each model to achieve the best performance.

Among these, the XGBoost model was identified as the optimal disease prediction model, with an AUC of 0.978 and an accuracy rate of 90%.\n\nIn addition to comparing these advanced models, we also considered simpler baselines. However, the focus of our study was on identifying the most effective model for predicting kidney disease, and we found that the XGBoost model outperformed the other models in terms of accuracy and AUC.\n\nNot applicable",
  "evaluation/confidence": "Evaluation Confidence\n\nThe evaluation of the models involved several key metrics, including accuracy and the area under the ROC curve (AUC).

For instance, in the context of gene enrichment analysis, terms with an adjusted p-value \u2264 0.05 were considered significant. This rigorous statistical approach ensures that the identified genes and pathways are genuinely associated with the disease progression rather than being due to random chance.\n\nFurthermore, the feature importance was evaluated using the F score in the XGBoost model.
