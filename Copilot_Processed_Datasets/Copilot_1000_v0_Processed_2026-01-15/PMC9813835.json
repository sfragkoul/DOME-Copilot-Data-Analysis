  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from the medical records of elderly patients with ovarian cancer who received treatment at the Department of Gynaecology at Jingzhou Central Hospital between January 31, 2016, and January 31, 2022. The dataset consists of 674 patients who met specific inclusion criteria, such as being older than 60 years, having clinical stages of III and above, and undergoing cytoreductive surgery. The data collected included various clinical parameters such as age, body mass index (BMI), catheter retention time, catheter intubation times, operation time, intraoperative blood loss, length of hospital stay, diabetes, hypertension, prophylactic use of antibiotics, and postoperative hypoproteinaemia.\n\nThe dataset was divided into a training set (70%) and a validation set (30%) to verify the prediction model. This division was done randomly to ensure that the model could be internally validated. The training set consisted of 471 patients, while the validation set consisted of 203 patients. The dataset has not been used in previous papers by the community, as this study represents original research conducted by the authors.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into two main splits: a training set and a testing set. The training set consisted of 471 data points, which accounted for 70% of the total dataset. The testing set, on the other hand, comprised 203 data points, making up the remaining 30%.\n\nWithin the training set, there were 70 data points where the condition of interest was present and 401 where it was not. Similarly, in the testing set, 26 data points had the condition, while 177 did not.\n\nThe distribution of data points in each split was designed to ensure a representative sample for both training and validation purposes. This division allowed for robust model development and accurate evaluation of predictive performance.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset used in this study consisted of clinical data from 674 elderly patients with ovarian cancer. To develop and validate machine learning-based models, the data were randomly divided into a training set and a verification set. The training set comprised 70% of the data, while the verification set included the remaining 30%. This split was performed to ensure that the prediction model could be effectively verified and validated.\n\nThe training and verification sets were designed to be independent. This independence was enforced through random division, ensuring that the data in each set did not overlap. The random division process helped to mitigate any potential bias that could arise from non-random selection methods.\n\nThe distribution of the dataset in this study aligns with common practices in machine learning, where a significant portion of the data is used for training the model, and a smaller portion is reserved for validation. This approach is consistent with previously published machine learning datasets, which often use similar splits to ensure robust model evaluation. The random division and independence of the sets are crucial for obtaining reliable and generalizable results.",
  "dataset/availability": "Not applicable",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithms used in this study are well-established and widely recognized in the field. The algorithms employed include the random forest classifier (RFC), support vector machine, extreme gradient boosting, artificial neural network (ANN), and decision tree (DT). These algorithms are not new but are chosen for their robustness and effectiveness in predictive modeling.\n\nThe random forest classifier and decision tree algorithms operate on the principle of \"branching and pruning,\" which helps in creating a robust model by navigating the parameter space effectively. The artificial neural network relies on the concept of \"hidden layer\" iteration, allowing it to learn complex patterns in the data. Support vector machines and extreme gradient boosting are based on iterative algorithm principles, which enhance their predictive accuracy.\n\nThese algorithms were selected based on their proven track record in similar studies and their ability to handle the specific characteristics of the dataset used in this research. The choice of these algorithms ensures that the models developed are reliable and capable of providing accurate predictions for urinary tract infections in the studied population.\n\nThe decision to use these established algorithms rather than developing a new one is driven by the need for reliability and validation. New algorithms often require extensive testing and validation, which can be time-consuming and may not always yield better results than well-established methods. By leveraging proven algorithms, the study focuses on applying machine learning to improve clinical outcomes, rather than innovating in the algorithmic space.",
  "optimization/meta": "The models developed in this study do not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, they utilize a variety of machine-learning methods independently to predict urinary tract infections.\n\nThe machine-learning methods employed include the random forest classifier (RFC), support vector machine, extreme gradient boosting, artificial neural network (ANN), and decision tree (DT). These methods were selected based on their established principles and effectiveness in predictive modeling.\n\nThe random forest classifier and decision tree are based on the algorithm principle of \u201cbranching and pruning,\u201d while the artificial neural network operates on the concept of \u201chidden layer\u201d iteration. Support vector machine and extreme gradient boosting also rely on their iterative algorithm principles.\n\nThe data used for training and validation was randomly divided into a training set (70%) and a verification set (30%). This division ensures that the training data is independent, as the verification set is used solely to evaluate the prediction model's performance without influencing the training process.\n\nThe prediction efficiency of these models was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic curve, the area under the curve, decision curve analysis, and clinical impact curve. The random forest classifier demonstrated strong prediction performance in both the training and validation cohorts, outperforming other models such as the generalized linear model.\n\nIn summary, the models developed are not meta-predictors but rather individual machine-learning algorithms trained and validated on independent datasets. The random forest classifier and decision tree models were particularly effective in guiding the prediction of urinary tract infections.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the machine-learning algorithms employed in this study, data encoding and preprocessing were crucial steps to ensure the models' robustness and accuracy. Initially, variables with missing values exceeding 10% were excluded to maintain data integrity. The dataset was then randomly split into a training set (70%) and a validation set (30%) to facilitate model development and verification.\n\nThe inclusion of variables was guided by principles reported in previous studies, ensuring that only relevant features were considered. The 'OOB error' principle, specifically the Gini index, was utilized to screen and select the most significant variables. The Gini index measures the impurity or purity of a dataset, with lower values indicating higher purity. This index was instrumental in identifying the top predictors, which included age, BMI, catheter-related factors, blood loss, diabetes, and hypoproteinaemia.\n\nDescriptive analysis involved assessing median and interquartile ranges for continuous variables and frequencies for categorical variables. Statistical tests, such as the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and \u03c72 test, were employed to compare differences between groups. The best subset of explanatory variables was selected during the model-building process, with the Gini index determining the weight of each candidate variable.\n\nThe data preprocessing and encoding steps were performed using Python (version 3.9.2) and R (version 4.0.4), ensuring rigorous statistical analysis and model validation. All P values were two-tailed, with a significance level set at P < 0.05. This comprehensive approach to data encoding and preprocessing laid a solid foundation for the subsequent development and evaluation of the machine-learning models.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized a total of 13 variables for initial analysis through Pearson correlation analysis. From these, seven key variables were identified as the top predictors for our machine learning-based model. These variables were age, body mass index (BMI), catheter use, catheter intubation times, blood loss, diabetes, and hypoproteinaemia. The selection of these variables was based on their significant correlation with urinary tract infections (UTIs) and their consistency with findings from correlation analysis. The iterative analysis and the principle of 'OOB error' were employed to screen and validate these model variables, ensuring that they contributed effectively to the prediction model. The final model used these seven variables to achieve robust and accurate predictions.",
  "optimization/features": "In the optimization process of our machine learning models, we initially considered a comprehensive set of clinical features and variables. To ensure the robustness and efficiency of our models, feature selection was performed using the training set only. This approach helped in identifying the most relevant predictors for urinary tract infections (UTIs) among elderly patients with ovarian cancer.\n\nThrough iterative analysis and Pearson correlation analysis, we screened and selected a subset of variables. The final model utilized seven key features as input. These features included age, body mass index (BMI), catheter retention time, catheter intubation times, intraoperative blood loss, diabetes, and hypoproteinaemia. These variables were chosen based on their significant correlation with UTIs and their contribution to the predictive power of the models.\n\nThe feature selection process was crucial in enhancing the performance of our machine learning algorithms, ensuring that only the most informative variables were used in the final models. This step helped in reducing overfitting and improving the generalization capability of the models.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The study employed several machine learning algorithms, each with its own set of parameters, to develop predictive models for urinary tract infections (UTIs) in elderly patients with ovarian cancer. The algorithms used included random forest classifier (RFC), support vector machine, extreme gradient boosting, artificial neural network (ANN), and decision tree (DT). The number of parameters in these models can indeed be larger than the number of training points, especially in complex models like ANN and RFC.\n\nTo address the risk of overfitting, several strategies were implemented. Firstly, the data was randomly divided into a training set (70%) and a validation set (30%). This division allowed for the model to be trained on one subset of data and validated on another, ensuring that the model's performance was not merely a result of memorizing the training data. Secondly, the principle of 'OOB error' was employed to screen model variables. This method helps in selecting variables that contribute most to the model's predictive power, thereby reducing the complexity and the risk of overfitting. Additionally, the Gini index was used to measure the purity of the splits in the decision trees, which is a common technique to prevent overfitting by ensuring that the model does not become too complex.\n\nTo rule out underfitting, the study used a comprehensive set of variables that were screened based on their significance in previous studies and their correlation with UTIs. The iterative analysis and the use of the Gini index ensured that the most relevant variables were included in the model. Furthermore, the use of multiple algorithms allowed for a comparison of their performances, ensuring that the final model was not too simplistic. The evaluation of the models using the receiver operating characteristic curve, decision curve analysis, and clinical impact curve provided a robust assessment of the models' predictive accuracy and discrimination ability.\n\nIn summary, the study carefully managed the balance between overfitting and underfitting by using a combination of data splitting, variable screening, and model evaluation techniques. This approach ensured that the final models were both complex enough to capture the underlying patterns in the data and simple enough to generalize well to new, unseen data.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, several techniques were employed to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our machine learning models. One of the key methods used was the principle of 'OOB error' to screen model variables. This involved calculating the Gini index, which measures the impurity or purity of a set. A smaller Gini index indicates a lower probability of selecting mixed samples, thereby increasing the purity of the set. This approach helped in selecting the most relevant variables for our models.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized the concept of 'branching and pruning' in algorithms like the random forest classifier (RFC) and decision tree (DT). This technique involves creating decision trees that split the data into subsets based on the most significant variables and then pruning the trees to remove branches that do not provide power in predicting target variables. This process helps in reducing the complexity of the model and preventing it from overfitting to the training data.\n\nFor the artificial neural network (ANN), we relied on the 'hidden layer' iteration. This involves training the network through multiple layers, where each layer extracts different levels of features from the data. By iteratively adjusting the weights and biases in these layers, the model learns to generalize better from the training data, thus reducing the risk of overfitting.\n\nFurthermore, we ensured that variables with a high percentage of missing values were excluded from the final model. Specifically, any variable with \u2265 10% missing values was not considered, which helped in maintaining the integrity and reliability of the data used for training and validation.\n\nThe data were randomly divided into a training set (70%) and a validation set (30%). This split allowed us to train the models on one subset of the data and validate their performance on an unseen subset, providing a more accurate assessment of the models' generalization capabilities.\n\nIn summary, through the use of variable screening based on the Gini index, branching and pruning in decision trees, hidden layer iteration in neural networks, and rigorous data splitting, we effectively prevented overfitting and enhanced the predictive performance of our machine learning models.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters used in our study are not explicitly detailed in the provided information. However, the models employed, such as the random forest classifier (RFC), support vector machine, extreme gradient boosting, artificial neural network (ANN), and decision tree (DT), are standard machine learning algorithms with well-documented parameters. The specific configurations for these models can typically be found in the supplementary materials or the methodology section of similar studies.\n\nThe optimization schedule and model files are not directly mentioned, but the process involved dividing the data into training and verification sets, using principles like the Gini index for variable screening, and evaluating models through receiver operating characteristic curves and decision curve analysis. These steps are common in machine learning model development and validation.\n\nRegarding availability and licensing, the study does not provide specific details on where to access the exact configurations or model files. However, the methods and algorithms used are based on established practices in the field of machine learning, and the data used for training and validation were derived from a retrospective analysis of medical records. For access to the specific datasets or detailed model configurations, one would typically need to contact the authors or refer to supplementary materials, which are not provided here.",
  "model/interpretability": "The models employed in this study encompass a range of interpretability levels, from transparent to more complex, black-box approaches. The decision tree (DT) model is notably transparent, offering clear insights into its decision-making process. In the DT model, variables such as age and catheter usage play pivotal roles, serving as critical factors in the branching process. This transparency allows for straightforward interpretation of how specific variables influence the model's predictions.\n\nIn contrast, the random forest classifier (RFC) and artificial neural network (ANN) models are more complex and can be considered black-box models to some extent. While the RFC model provides a robust predictive performance, its ensemble nature makes it less interpretable compared to a single decision tree. However, techniques like variable importance scores can shed light on which features are most influential in the RFC model's decisions.\n\nThe ANN model, with its hidden layers and iterative learning process, is even more opaque. It excels in capturing intricate patterns within the data but at the cost of interpretability. Despite this, the ANN model demonstrated strong predictive efficiency, particularly when compared to other models.\n\nOverall, while some models offer clear, interpretable insights, others prioritize predictive accuracy, necessitating the use of additional techniques to understand their inner workings. The choice between transparency and complexity depends on the specific requirements and trade-offs acceptable in the context of urinary tract infection prediction.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a classification model. It is designed to predict the occurrence of urinary tract infections (UTIs) based on various input variables. The model outputs a binary result, indicating whether a patient is likely to have a UTI or not. This classification is achieved through the use of several machine learning algorithms, including the random forest classifier (RFC), decision tree (DT), support vector machine, extreme gradient boosting, and artificial neural network (ANN). The RFC model, in particular, demonstrated strong prediction performance in both the training and validation cohorts. The model's efficiency was evaluated using metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, decision curve analysis, and clinical impact curve. The top variables contributing to the model's predictions include age, body mass index (BMI), catheter use, catheter intubation times, blood loss, diabetes, and hypoproteinaemia. These variables were selected based on their significance and the principle of minimizing the Gini index, which measures the impurity or purity of the data splits. The model's output is the final judgment result for each patient, indicating the presence or absence of a UTI.",

The data was split into a training set (70%) and a validation set (30%) to verify the prediction model. This division allowed for the assessment of model performance on unseen data, simulating real-world application scenarios.\n\nThe receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the models in both the training and validation sets. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) quantified the discrimination ability of each model, providing a single metric to compare their performance. Additionally, decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curve (CIC) were employed to further assess the models' clinical utility. These methods helped in understanding the net benefit of using the models at various threshold probabilities, ensuring that the models were not only accurate but also practically useful in a clinical setting.\n\nThe optimal subset of variables for modeling was determined based on the intersection of variable sets, ensuring that the most relevant features were included. This approach helped in reducing overfitting and improving the generalizability of the models. The models evaluated included random forest classifier (RFC), support vector machine, extreme gradient boosting, artificial neural network (ANN), and decision tree (DT). Each of these models was assessed using the aforementioned metrics to determine their predictive performance.\n\nThe RFC model, in particular, demonstrated strong prediction performance in both the training and validation cohorts. The decision curve analysis further validated the robustness of the RFC model, showing its potential for clinical application. The AUC of the RFC models peaked when seven key variables were included, highlighting the importance of feature selection in model performance. Overall, the evaluation methods ensured a comprehensive assessment of the models, focusing on their accuracy, clinical utility, and generalizability.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed several performance metrics to evaluate the prediction accuracy and discrimination ability of our machine learning-based models. The primary metric used was the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which visually represents the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity across different threshold values. To quantify the discrimination ability of each model, we calculated the area under the ROC curve (AUC). A higher AUC indicates better model performance.\n\nIn addition to the ROC curve and AUC, we utilized decision curve analysis (DCA) to assess the clinical net benefit of our models at various threshold probabilities. This method helps to determine the range of threshold probabilities for which the model provides a net benefit compared to treating all patients or treating none.\n\nFurthermore, we employed the clinical impact curve to evaluate the practical implications of our models in a clinical setting. This curve illustrates the number of true positives and false positives at different threshold probabilities, providing insights into the potential impact of the model on patient outcomes.\n\nThese performance metrics are widely recognized and used in the literature for evaluating predictive models, ensuring that our evaluation is representative and comparable to other studies in the field.",

These models included the random forest classifier (RFC), support vector machine (SVM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), artificial neural network (ANN), and decision tree (DT). Each of these models was evaluated for its prediction performance using a comprehensive set of metrics.\n\nTo ensure a robust comparison, we divided our dataset into a training set (70%) and a validation set (30%). This division allowed us to train our models on a substantial portion of the data while reserving a separate set for validation, thereby ensuring that our models could generalize well to unseen data.\n\nThe prediction efficiency of these models was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which provided a visual representation of the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Additionally, we quantified the discrimination ability of each model using the area under the ROC curve (AUC), decision curve analysis (DCA), and clinical impact curve (CIC). These metrics offered a thorough assessment of each model's performance, enabling us to identify the most effective algorithms for predicting UTIs.\n\nNot applicable",

The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was quantified to measure the discrimination ability of each model. Additionally, decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curve (CIC) were employed to further evaluate the models' performance.\n\nStatistical significance was determined using Bonferroni corrected probability values for qualitative data comparisons. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test or \u03c72 test was used to compare differences between groups. All P values were two-tailed, and a P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. This rigorous statistical approach ensures that the results are reliable and that the models' superior performance can be confidently claimed.\n\nConfidence intervals for the performance metrics were not explicitly mentioned, but the use of statistical tests and the significance level of P < 0.05 indicates a strong confidence in the results. The models were validated using a split dataset approach, with 70% of the data used for training and 30% for validation.
