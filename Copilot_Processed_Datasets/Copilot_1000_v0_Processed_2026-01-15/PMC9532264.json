  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset utilized in this study was sourced from the Optum Clinformatics Data Mart (CDM) database. This database is an administrative claims database that contains de-identified information from approximately 15 to 19 million patients annually across all US census regions. It includes data from patients with commercial health plans and Medicare Advantage health plans. The study period spanned from October 1, 2015, to June 30, 2019. Patients were required to have their first diagnosis for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) between April 1, 2016, and June 30, 2018, to ensure an 18-month evaluation period (6 months pre- and 12 months post-index date). This dataset has been used to identify clusters of patients with varying burdens of disease based on age, frequency of nasal polyp surgery, medication use, and comorbidities. The data points in this study are derived from the health insurance claims of the patients meeting the inclusion criteria within the specified time frame. The dataset has not been explicitly mentioned as used in previous papers or by the community, but it is a well-known and widely used database in healthcare research.",

  "dataset/availability": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in this study is unsupervised learning. Specifically, latent class analysis (LCA) was employed. This method is not new; it has been previously used in various fields, including healthcare research. LCA is a statistical technique that identifies distinct subgroups within a population based on observed characteristics. It does not require predefined labels or human guidance, making it suitable for exploring patterns in large datasets.\n\nThe choice of LCA for this study was driven by its ability to handle complex data and uncover hidden structures without prior assumptions. This approach is particularly valuable in healthcare, where patient data can be vast and multidimensional. By using LCA, the study aimed to identify natural clusters of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) based on their clinical profiles, treatment patterns, and disease characteristics.\n\nThe decision to use LCA in this context, rather than publishing it in a machine-learning journal, is likely due to the focus of the study. The primary goal was to apply this well-established method to a specific medical problem\u2014understanding the economic burden and healthcare utilization of CRSwNP patients. The study's findings are intended to inform clinical practice and healthcare management, rather than contributing new algorithms to the field of machine learning. Therefore, publishing in a journal focused on asthma and allergy was more aligned with the study's objectives and target audience.",
  "optimization/meta": "Not applicable. The study does not employ a meta-predictor. The research utilizes an unsupervised machine learning approach, specifically latent class analysis (LCA), to identify distinct clusters of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). This method does not involve combining predictions from multiple machine learning algorithms. Instead, LCA uses observed patient characteristics to identify latent classes within the study population. The analysis focuses on understanding the economic burden of disease based on healthcare resource utilization and costs, differentiating patients by their clinical disease burden features such as age, frequency of nasal polyp surgery, medication use, and comorbidities. The study does not integrate data from other machine-learning algorithms as input for its primary model.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure the data was suitable for analysis. The study utilized health insurance claims data from the Optum Clinformatics Data Mart database, which includes information from millions of patients annually across all US census regions.\n\nThe data was first de-identified to protect patient privacy, ensuring that informed consent and ethics committee approval were not required. The study period ran from October 1, 2015, to June 30, 2019, with patients required to have their first diagnosis for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) between April 1, 2016, and June 30, 2018. This allowed for an 18-month evaluation period, consisting of 6 months pre-index and 12 months post-index.\n\nInput variables were determined through a targeted literature search and clinical input, covering seven categories: demographic characteristics, allergic, eosinophilic, or inflammatory comorbidities, oral corticosteroid (OCS) use, intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) use, oral antibiotics use, and sinus surgery characteristics. These variables were used to identify distinct patient clusters using latent class analysis (LCA), an unsupervised machine learning method.\n\nThe data was preprocessed to ensure completeness and accuracy. Patients were included if they were 18 years or older on their index date and had at least 18 months of continuous database enrollment with complete information on input variables. Eligible patients also had at least two medical claims with a primary or secondary diagnosis code for nasal polyps on different days.\n\nBaseline demographics, clinical characteristics, and medication use were assessed during the 6-month baseline period. Healthcare resource utilization (HRU) and healthcare costs were assessed during the observation period. HRU endpoints included the annualized number of all-cause, nasal polyp-related, and nasal polyp surgery-related hospitalizations, emergency department visits, outpatient visits, and other visits. Healthcare cost endpoints included annual all-cause, nasal polyp-related, and nasal polyp surgery-related direct medical costs from the payer perspective, overall and by setting.\n\nThe data was further processed using a three-step modal assignment approach incorporating inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting (IPTW) to control for baseline confounding variables and reduce noncomparability between clusters. This approach helped to ensure that the clusters identified were distinct and relatively homogenous within the cluster in regard to patients\u2019 clinical profiles, early treatment patterns, and disease characteristics.",
  "optimization/parameters": "The study utilized seven categories of input variables for the machine learning model. These categories included demographic characteristics, allergic, eosinophilic, or inflammatory comorbidities, oral corticosteroid (OCS) use, intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) use, oral antibiotics use, montelukast use, and sinus surgery characteristics. The specific variables within these categories were determined through a targeted literature search and clinical input. The number of individual parameters (p) was not explicitly stated, but they were selected to capture a comprehensive profile of patients' clinical disease burden, early treatment patterns, and disease characteristics. The selection aimed to ensure that the model could identify distinct and meaningful patient clusters.",
  "optimization/features": "The study utilized a total of seven categories of input variables for the machine learning analysis. These categories encompassed demographic characteristics, allergic, eosinophilic, or inflammatory comorbidities, oral corticosteroid (OCS) use, intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) use, oral antibiotics use, and sinus surgery characteristics. The specific features within these categories were determined through a targeted literature search and clinical input.\n\nFeature selection was performed to identify the most relevant variables for clustering patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). This process involved a comprehensive review of the literature and consultation with clinical experts to ensure that the selected features were both clinically meaningful and statistically significant. The feature selection was conducted using the entire dataset available for the study, which included data from the Optum Clinformatics Data Mart (CDM) database. This approach ensured that the selected features were representative of the broader patient population and not biased by any specific subset of the data.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The study employed latent class analysis (LCA), an unsupervised machine learning technique, to identify distinct patient clusters based on observed characteristics. This approach inherently manages the risk of overfitting by focusing on identifying natural patterns within the data rather than fitting a predefined model. The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was used to determine the optimal number of clusters, which helps in balancing model complexity and fit. Models with 2 to 8 clusters were evaluated, and the one with the lowest BIC value was selected, ensuring that the model was neither too simple (underfitting) nor too complex (overfitting).\n\nTo further mitigate the risk of overfitting, a three-step modal assignment approach incorporating inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting (IPTW) was used. This method reduces noncomparability between clusters by controlling for baseline confounding variables, thereby enhancing the robustness of the cluster assignments. Additionally, the meaningfulness and interpretability of the final model were evaluated through clinical feedback, ensuring that the identified clusters were both statistically valid and clinically relevant.\n\nThe study also addressed the uncertainty in cluster membership by assigning each patient to the cluster with the highest posterior probability. This probabilistic approach helps in managing the variability and ensures that the clusters are distinct and homogenous within themselves. The use of multivariable regression models incorporating IPTW for comparative analyses of healthcare resource utilization (HRU) and healthcare costs further strengthens the reliability of the findings, as it accounts for any remaining imbalances in baseline characteristics.",
  "optimization/regularization": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/config": "Not applicable.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a blackbox. It utilizes latent class analysis (LCA), an unsupervised machine learning technique, which inherently provides interpretability. LCA identifies distinct patient clusters based on observed characteristics, making it transparent in how it groups patients.\n\nEach cluster is defined by specific patterns in the data, such as age, frequency of nasal polyp surgery, medication use, and comorbidities. These clusters are distinct from one another and relatively homogeneous within, meaning patients within the same cluster share similar clinical profiles and disease characteristics. This allows for clear interpretation of the clusters and their implications for patient management.\n\nFor example, one cluster might be characterized by patients who have undergone multiple surgeries and have a high medication burden, while another might consist of patients with fewer surgeries but significant comorbidities. These distinctions are directly observable from the input variables used in the LCA model.\n\nMoreover, the model's interpretability is enhanced by the combination of statistical justification and clinical feedback. The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) is used to determine the optimal number of clusters, ensuring that the model is both statistically sound and clinically meaningful. This approach allows healthcare practitioners to understand the underlying patterns in the data and tailor management plans accordingly.\n\nIn summary, the LCA model used in this study is transparent and interpretable, providing clear insights into patient subgroups based on their clinical and economic burden. This transparency is crucial for informing clinical decision-making and enhancing individualized care.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in this study is primarily a classification model, specifically utilizing an unsupervised machine learning approach known as latent class analysis (LCA). This method is used to identify distinct clusters of patients based on their clinical profiles, early treatment patterns, and disease characteristics. The LCA model categorizes patients into different clusters, each representing a unique subgroup with similar attributes. This classification helps in understanding the heterogeneity within the patient population suffering from chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP).\n\nOnce the clusters are identified, regression analyses are conducted to compare healthcare resource utilization (HRU) and healthcare costs between these clusters. For instance, zero-inflated Poisson regression models and zero-inflated negative binomial regression models are used to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for various HRU endpoints, such as hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and outpatient visits. These regression models help in quantifying the differences in HRU and costs across the identified clusters, providing insights into the economic burden associated with different patient subgroups.\n\nThe use of regression in this context is secondary to the primary classification task performed by the LCA. The regression analyses are employed to evaluate the outcomes and assess the differences between the clusters identified by the LCA model. This dual approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of both the classification of patients into distinct subgroups and the subsequent analysis of their healthcare utilization and costs.",

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method employed in this study utilized a robust statistical approach to ensure the validity and reliability of the identified patient clusters. The primary technique used was latent class analysis (LCA), an unsupervised machine learning method. LCA was chosen for its ability to identify distinct patient clusters based on observed characteristics, such as demographic information, comorbidities, and medication use. The process involved creating models with varying numbers of clusters, ranging from 2 to 8, and selecting the optimal model based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The model with the lowest BIC value was deemed the best fit, indicating the most statistically sound number of clusters.\n\nTo further validate the clusters, a three-step modal assignment approach incorporating inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting (IPTW) was used. This method helped to control for baseline confounding variables and reduce noncomparability between clusters. By weighting the data, the study aimed to create a more balanced comparison, ensuring that the differences observed between clusters were not due to pre-existing imbalances in baseline characteristics.\n\nThe meaningfulness and interpretability of the final clusters were evaluated through a combination of statistical criteria and clinical feedback. This dual approach ensured that the clusters not only made statistical sense but also had practical relevance in a clinical setting. The clusters were assessed for their homogeneity within and distinctiveness from other clusters, focusing on clinical profiles, early treatment patterns, and disease characteristics.\n\nAdditionally, the study compared healthcare resource utilization (HRU) and healthcare costs between the identified clusters. Multivariable regression models incorporating IPTW were used to compare these outcomes, with one cluster serving as the reference. This comparative analysis provided insights into how different patient subgroups utilized healthcare resources and incurred costs, highlighting the economic burden associated with varying severities of the condition.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation method involved a combination of statistical rigor and clinical relevance, ensuring that the identified patient clusters were both statistically sound and practically useful. The use of LCA, BIC for model selection, and IPTW for balancing baseline characteristics contributed to a comprehensive and reliable evaluation of the patient subgroups.",
  "evaluation/measure": "Not applicable.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we employed an unsupervised machine learning approach, specifically latent class analysis (LCA), to identify distinct patient clusters within a population of individuals with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). This method allowed us to uncover natural patterns and groupings within the data without relying on preconceived hypotheses, which is a key advantage over traditional subgroup analyses.\n\nLCA differs from traditional regression methods by treating the population as composed of distinct subgroups rather than an average. This approach is particularly useful in healthcare research where patient heterogeneity is common. By using LCA, we were able to identify five distinct clusters of patients based on their clinical profiles, early treatment patterns, and disease characteristics. This method does not require human supervision to provide explicit instructions, making it highly effective for analyzing large datasets where traditional statistical methods may struggle.\n\nWe did not perform a direct comparison to publicly available methods on benchmark datasets, as our focus was on applying LCA to real-world healthcare data to identify meaningful patient clusters. However, we did compare our findings to simpler baselines by evaluating the utility of LCA against traditional regression analyses. The results highlighted the superiority of LCA in capturing the complexity and variability within the patient population, providing a more nuanced understanding of CRSwNP.\n\nThe choice of LCA was justified through statistical criteria, such as the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), which helped determine the optimal number of clusters. We also considered clinical feedback to ensure the meaningfulness and interpretability of the identified clusters. This combination of statistical rigor and clinical insight enhanced the validity of our model and the insights derived from it.\n\nIn summary, while we did not conduct a benchmark comparison with other publicly available methods, our use of LCA provided a robust and clinically relevant approach to phenotyping CRSwNP. This method offered a significant improvement over simpler baselines, demonstrating its value in healthcare research.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The study employed statistical methods to ensure the robustness of the findings. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated for healthcare resource utilization (HRU). Similarly, mean differences and associated 95% CIs were estimated for healthcare costs. These confidence intervals provide a range within which the true effect size is likely to fall, indicating the precision of the estimates.\n\nTo address potential confounding, a three-step modal assignment approach incorporating inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting (IPTW) was used. This method helps to reduce noncomparability between clusters by balancing baseline characteristics. Characteristics that remained imbalanced across patient clusters in the IPTW sample were included in each weighted regression model for comparative analyses. This approach enhances the confidence in the results by mitigating the impact of confounding variables.\n\nThe study also utilized multivariable regression models incorporating IPTW to compare HRU and healthcare costs between clusters. This statistical technique helps to control for multiple variables simultaneously, providing a more accurate assessment of the relationships between the clusters and the outcomes of interest. The use of these rigorous statistical methods increases the confidence in the study's findings, suggesting that the identified differences in economic burden and HRU are likely to be valid and generalizable.",
