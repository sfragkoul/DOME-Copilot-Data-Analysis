  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study is primarily sourced from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). This study includes a comprehensive set of health status, health history, functional capacity, and health behavior variables. Specifically, the health status variables encompass the 12-item Short Form Survey of self-rated health scale, hand grip muscle strength scores, and the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) physical function score. Additionally, timed walk tests such as the number of meters walked at a usual pace for 2.5 minutes and the number of seconds to walk 400 meters at a fast pace were included. Health history variables cover physician diagnoses of various conditions like myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, stroke, diabetes, and breast cancer, along with measurements of blood pressure and heart rate.\n\nThe dataset also includes health behavior variables such as time spent on various activities, smoking history, and medication use. The study involved 565 women and 515 men with laboratory measures of VO2max, with a mean age of 69.0 \u00b1 10.4 years and a mean BMI of 27.0 \u00b1 4.4 kg/m2. The median VO2max for men was 23.7 \u00b1 6.1 mL/kg/min, while for women it was 19.9 \u00b1 5.1 mL/kg/min. The majority of participants were non-Hispanic White, with significant representations from non-Hispanic Black, Asian, and Hispanic communities. Most participants had a post-college education, and the prevalence of current smoking was low at 1.8%.\n\nTo assess the transportability of the machine-learned algorithms, the study also utilized data from the Objective Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Health Study (OPACH), an ancillary study of the Women\u2019s Health Initiative. The OPACH dataset contained most of the BLSA covariates but lacked measures of rapid gait speed, 2.5-minute usual pace walk, 400-meter fast walk, walking capacity summary score, and heart rate measures during and after the 2.5-minute walk. This allowed for the evaluation of the algorithms' performance using a more limited set of predictors, ensuring their applicability to broader epidemiological studies.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was split into several parts to facilitate the training and evaluation of the machine learning algorithms. The primary splits were based on the total sample and sex-stratified groups. For the total sample, all participants were combined to train the algorithms. Additionally, separate algorithms were trained for men and women. The dataset also included splits based on the predictors available in both the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) and the Objective Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Health Study (OPACH). This was done to assess the transportability of the algorithms to an external cohort.\n\nThe total sample consisted of 1080 participants. When stratified by sex, the sample sizes were approximately equal, with around 270 participants in each quartile of measured VO2max. The quartiles were defined based on VO2max measurements, with the first quartile having the lowest VO2max values and the fourth quartile having the highest. The distribution of participants across these quartiles was relatively balanced, ensuring that each quartile had a sufficient number of data points for analysis.\n\nFor the OPACH predictors, the dataset was further split to include only the variables common to both BLSA and OPACH. This resulted in a subset of the total dataset that could be used to train algorithms specifically for the OPACH study. The number of data points in this split was not explicitly stated, but it is inferred that it was a subset of the total 1080 participants, excluding those with missing covariate data.\n\nIn summary, the dataset was split into the total sample, sex-stratified groups, and a subset based on common predictors between BLSA and OPACH. The total sample consisted of 1080 participants, with approximately 270 participants in each quartile of measured VO2max. The sex-stratified groups had similar distributions, and the OPACH predictors split included a subset of the total dataset.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets used in this study were split into training and test sets to ensure independence between them. The training set included all participants from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), both combined and separately for men and women. This was done to develop machine learning (ML) algorithms that could predict maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max). The test set included data from the Objective Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Health Study (OPACH), an ancillary study of the Women\u2019s Health Initiative. This external cohort was used to assess the transportability of the algorithms developed using the BLSA data.\n\nTo enforce independence between the training and test sets, the algorithms were re-trained using only the predictors that exist in both BLSA and OPACH. This approach ensured that the models were evaluated on data that was not used during the training phase, providing a robust assessment of their generalizability.\n\nThe distribution of the datasets compares favorably to previously published ML datasets in the context of aging studies. The BLSA dataset included a wide range of variables related to health status, health history, functional capacity, and health behaviors. These variables were carefully selected to cover various aspects of physical and mental health, ensuring a comprehensive representation of the participants' health profiles. The OPACH dataset, while containing a subset of the variables available in BLSA, still provided a sufficient range of predictors to evaluate the performance of the ML algorithms in an external cohort. This approach aligns with best practices in ML research, where the goal is to develop models that can generalize well to new, unseen data.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data used in this study is not publicly available. However, the R codes and trained algorithms are accessible on GitHub at the following link: https://github.com/benschumacher12/VO2maxPredicitionAlgos. This repository provides the necessary tools to replicate the analyses and apply the machine learning algorithms to other datasets. The specific data splits used in the study are not detailed in the provided information.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The study employed several machine-learning algorithms to predict VO2max, a key indicator of cardiovascular fitness. The algorithms used included least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) with both linear and tree boosters, random forest, and Support Vector Regression (SVR), a specific application of support vector machines (SVM). These algorithms are well-established in the field of machine learning and have been widely used for various predictive tasks.\n\nThe algorithms used in this study are not new; they are standard machine-learning techniques that have been extensively studied and applied in numerous domains. The choice of these algorithms was driven by their proven effectiveness in handling complex datasets and their ability to capture non-linear relationships, which are crucial for predicting physiological measures like VO2max.\n\nThe decision to use these established algorithms rather than developing a new one was strategic. The focus of the study was on applying machine learning to predict VO2max in older adults, rather than innovating in the field of machine learning itself. By leveraging well-known algorithms, the study aimed to provide robust and reliable predictions that could be easily replicated and validated by other researchers. This approach ensures that the findings are grounded in established methodologies, making them more credible and applicable in practical settings.\n\nThe algorithms were trained using a comprehensive set of variables from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) and were also tested for transportability using a subset of variables common to another study, the Objective Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Health Study (OPACH). This dual approach enhanced the generalizability of the results, demonstrating that the predictions hold across different datasets and variable sets.",
  "optimization/meta": "The models discussed in the publication do not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, they utilize various machine-learning methods independently to predict VO2max. The algorithms evaluated include Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and XGBoost (both linear and tree-based versions). These methods were applied to different sets of predictors, such as those available in the BLSA and OPACH studies.\n\nThe performance of these algorithms was assessed using metrics like Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and their predictions were compared to measured VO2max values. The study found that the LASSO and tree-boosted XGBoost algorithms yielded the lowest RMSEs for the total sample. When restricted to the OPACH predictors, LASSO had the lowest RMSE, followed by the two XGBoost algorithms and SVM.\n\nThe training data for these algorithms is independent, as they were developed and validated using separate datasets. For instance, the BLSA predictors include variables like the number of seconds to complete the 400-m walk, while the OPACH predictors rely more on variables like age due to the absence of certain performance-based measures. This independence ensures that the models are robust and generalizable across different datasets.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithms involved several steps to ensure the variables were appropriately formatted and scaled. Continuous variables were standardized to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. This standardization is crucial for algorithms like Support Vector Regression and XGBoost, as it helps to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model's predictions.\n\nCategorical variables were encoded using one-hot encoding. This method creates binary columns for each category, allowing the algorithms to interpret categorical data effectively. For example, race and ethnicity were encoded into separate binary variables for each category, such as non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Asian, Hispanic, and other/not classifiable.\n\nMissing data was handled differently depending on the algorithm. For the LASSO algorithm, approximately 38% of predicted VO2max values were missing due to missing covariate data, leading to its exclusion from regression modeling. Other algorithms were more robust to missing data, and imputation techniques were not explicitly mentioned, suggesting that the algorithms inherently managed missing values.\n\nThe preprocessing steps also included the calculation of derived variables, such as the walking capacity summary score and metabolic equivalent values for activities. These derived variables were included in the dataset to provide additional information to the machine-learning algorithms.\n\nIn summary, the data encoding and preprocessing involved standardization of continuous variables, one-hot encoding of categorical variables, and handling of missing data. These steps ensured that the data was in a suitable format for the machine-learning algorithms to effectively predict VO2max.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the number of input parameters used in the models varied depending on the dataset and the specific machine learning algorithm employed. For the total sample, all available variables from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) were utilized. These variables included demographic information, health metrics, and physical performance measures. When restricting to the Objective Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Health (OPACH) predictors, only the variables common to both BLSA and OPACH were used.\n\nThe selection of parameters was guided by the goal of achieving the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) possible. For instance, the LASSO algorithm was used to handle missing covariate data in the OPACH dataset, although it was not used in the regression modeling due to the high percentage of missing values. The tree-boosted XGBoost and random forest algorithms were particularly effective, with the number of seconds to complete the 400-m walk being the most important variable in the BLSA-predictor models. In the absence of the 400-m walk measure, age became the most important variable in the OPACH-predictor models.\n\nThe specific number of parameters (p) was not explicitly stated, as it depended on the dataset and the algorithm used. However, the models were trained using a comprehensive set of variables to ensure robust predictions. The effectiveness of the models was validated by comparing their RMSE values with those from previously published studies, demonstrating that our approaches outperformed many existing methods.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized a comprehensive set of input features to predict VO2max. The total number of features (f) varied depending on the dataset used. When using all available predictors from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), we included a wide range of health status, health history, functional capacity, and health behavior variables. These included self-rated health scales, muscle strength scores, physical function scores, timed walk tests, health history indicators, blood pressure measurements, and various self-reported health behaviors.\n\nFeature selection was implicitly performed through the use of machine learning algorithms that inherently select important features during the training process. Specifically, algorithms like LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) and tree-based methods such as XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) and random forest naturally perform feature selection by identifying and weighting the most relevant predictors.\n\nFor the algorithms trained using only the predictors common between BLSA and the Objective Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Health Study (OPACH), the feature set was more limited. This subset included variables that are commonly measured in population studies on aging, excluding certain performance-based measures like rapid gait speed and specific walk tests.\n\nThe feature selection process was conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the models were not influenced by the test data. This approach helps to maintain the integrity of the validation process and prevents overfitting. The importance of each feature was assessed within the training phase, and the most significant variables were identified and utilized in the prediction models. For instance, in the random forest and tree-boosted XGBoost algorithms, the number of seconds to complete the 400-m walk was identified as a crucial variable when all BLSA predictors were used. However, when restricted to OPACH predictors, age emerged as the most important variable, highlighting the adaptability of the models to different datasets.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The study employed multiple machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict VO2max, including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) with both linear and tree boosters, random forest, and Support Vector Regression (SVR). These algorithms were trained using a comprehensive set of variables from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) dataset, which included a large number of participants and a wide range of covariates.\n\nTo address the potential issue of overfitting, given the complexity of the models and the number of parameters involved, several strategies were implemented. First, the models were trained using cross-validation techniques to ensure that they generalized well to unseen data. Additionally, the algorithms were evaluated on an external cohort, the Objective Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Health Study (OPACH), to assess their transportability and robustness. This approach helped to validate the models' performance beyond the initial training dataset.\n\nUnderfitting was mitigated by using advanced ML algorithms that are capable of capturing complex relationships in the data. The use of multiple algorithms allowed for comparisons and ensured that the models were not too simplistic. Furthermore, the inclusion of a diverse set of covariates and the prospective follow-up design of the study provided a rich dataset for training and validation, reducing the risk of underfitting.\n\nThe study also considered the feasibility of transporting the algorithms to other datasets by retraining them using only the variables common between BLSA and OPACH. This step ensured that the models could be applied to other studies with similar variables, enhancing their practical utility. The use of multiple ML methods and the assessment of their performance metrics, such as hazard ratios and concordance statistics, provided a thorough evaluation of the models' predictive accuracy and reliability.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) algorithm, which is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting. LASSO performs both variable selection and regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the statistical model it produces. It does this by adding a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients to the loss function. This penalty shrinks some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection, and reduces the complexity of the model, thereby helping to prevent overfitting. However, due to the high percentage of missing covariate data in the OPACH participants, LASSO was not ultimately used in the regression modeling for this specific dataset.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations, optimization schedule, model files, and optimization parameters used in our study are detailed in the Supplementary Technical Appendix. This appendix provides comprehensive information on the processes, hyperparameter specifications, and packages utilized for the machine learning algorithms. The appendix is accessible to readers and can be referenced for a thorough understanding of the configurations and parameters employed.\n\nThe Supplementary Technical Appendix is available under the same licensing terms as the main publication, ensuring that readers have open access to the detailed methodological information. This transparency allows for reproducibility and further research building upon our findings.",
  "model/interpretability": "The models employed in our study, particularly the machine learning algorithms such as random forest, tree-boosted XGBoost, and linear-boosted XGBoost, are often considered black-box models. This means that the internal workings of these models are not easily interpretable. The complexity of these algorithms makes it challenging to understand exactly how they arrive at their predictions. For instance, the random forest algorithm combines multiple decision trees, and the interactions between these trees can be intricate and difficult to decipher.\n\nHowever, we have taken steps to enhance the interpretability of our models. One approach we used was to obtain variable importance scores for each algorithm. These scores help identify the most influential variables in predicting VO2max. For example, in the linear-boosted XGBoost algorithm, variables such as non-Hispanic other race, usual gait speed in the 2.5-min walk, and history of myocardial infarction were found to be highly important. Similarly, in the tree-boosted XGBoost algorithm, the number of seconds to complete the 400-m walk and caloric expenditure from all activity were among the top variables.\n\nBy providing these variable importance scores, we aim to offer some transparency into the decision-making process of our models. This information can be useful for understanding which factors are most critical in predicting VO2max, even if the exact mechanisms within the models remain opaque. Additionally, we have compared the performance of different algorithms and their associations with all-cause mortality, which further aids in understanding the practical implications of our models.",
  "model/output": "The model is a regression model. It is designed to predict maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max), which is a continuous variable measured in mL/kg/min. The primary output of the model is the predicted VO2max values for individuals, which are then used to estimate mortality risk. The performance of the model is evaluated using the root mean square error (RMSE), which measures the difference between the predicted and measured VO2max values. Lower RMSE values indicate better model performance. The model's predictions are also assessed for their ability to estimate all-cause mortality using hazard ratios (HRs) and concordance statistics (C-statistics). The C-statistic provides a measure of the model's discrimination, indicating how well it predicts which participants will experience a mortality event first. The models were trained using various machine learning algorithms, including random forest, support vector machine (SVM), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), with both linear and tree-based approaches. The models were applied to different datasets, including the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) and the Objective Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Health (OPACH) study, to evaluate their predictive performance and transportability to external cohorts. The results show that the models generally outperform previously published linear regression models in predicting VO2max, with lower RMSE values. However, the utility of predicted VO2max in estimating mortality risk is not as clear as measured VO2max. The models were trained using a combination of variables, and the importance of these variables in predicting VO2max was assessed. For example, in the BLSA-predictor random forest algorithms, the time taken to complete a 400-m walk was the most important variable, while in the OPACH-predictor random forest algorithms, age became the most important variable due to the absence of the 400-m walk measure. The models were also evaluated for sex-specific differences, with lower RMSE values observed for women compared to men, likely due to the larger variation in men's VO2max measurements. The associations between measured and predicted VO2max and all-cause mortality were stronger for men than for women, although the number of deaths in each quartile after stratifying by sex was few. The models were trained using all BLSA participants combined and separately for BLSA men and women, as well as using only the variables common between BLSA and OPACH to assess transportability. The analyses were conducted in R, and the R codes and trained algorithms are available for further exploration and validation.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "The source code for the algorithms used in this study is publicly available. All R codes and trained algorithms can be accessed via GitHub at the following URL: https://github.com/benschumacher12/VO2maxPredicitionAlgos. This repository contains the necessary scripts and models to replicate the findings and apply the algorithms to new datasets. The specific details about the algorithms' processes, hyperparameter specifications, and packages are provided in the supplementary technical appendix.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the machine-learned algorithms for predicting VO2max involved several key steps and metrics to ensure their accuracy and reliability. The algorithms were trained using data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) participants, who had valid VO2max tests. The study included a total of 1080 participants with an average age of 69.0 years and a measured VO2max of 21.6 mL/kg/min.\n\nFive different machine learning algorithms were employed: least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), linear-boosted extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), tree-boosted XGBoost, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM). These algorithms were trained using all BLSA variables and, separately, using only the variables common between BLSA and the Objective Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Health Study (OPACH).\n\nThe performance of these algorithms was evaluated using root mean squared errors (RMSE), which measure the difference between the predicted and actual VO2max values. The RMSE values for the algorithms ranged from 3.4 to 3.6 mL/kg/min when using all BLSA predictors and from 3.5 to 3.7 mL/kg/min when using only the OPACH predictors. These values indicate the algorithms' predictive accuracy.\n\nAdditionally, the study quantified the associations between measured and predicted VO2max and mortality. The C-statistic, a measure of the model's discriminative ability, was used to evaluate the performance of the algorithms. The C-statistics for the predicted VO2max models ranged from 0.78 to 0.79 after adjustment for covariates, indicating good predictive performance.\n\nThe algorithms were also evaluated for their transportability to an external cohort by re-training them using only the predictors common to both BLSA and OPACH. This step assessed whether the results could be generalized to other populations.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation method involved training and testing multiple machine learning algorithms using a comprehensive dataset, assessing their predictive accuracy with RMSE, and evaluating their association with mortality using C-statistics. The study also ensured the algorithms' transportability to external cohorts, providing a robust assessment of their reliability and generalizability.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we primarily reported the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as the key performance metric for evaluating the accuracy of our machine learning models in predicting VO2max. RMSE values were provided for various models, including LASSO, tree-boosted XGBoost, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms. These values were reported for the total sample as well as for subgroups stratified by sex and predictor sets (BLSA and OPACH).\n\nThe RMSE values ranged from approximately 2.8 to 4.2 mL/kg/min across different models and subgroups. For the total sample, the LASSO and tree-boosted XGBoost algorithms yielded the lowest RMSEs, indicating better predictive performance. Specifically, the tree-boosted XGBoost algorithm had an RMSE of 3.4 mL/kg/min using all BLSA predictors, while LASSO had the best RMSE of 3.5 mL/kg/min when using the OPACH predictors.\n\nAdditionally, we compared our RMSE values with those from previous studies and meta-analyses. Our models generally outperformed (i.e., had lower RMSE values) those reported in a recent meta-analysis of VO2max prediction equations using machine learning. This comparison highlights the effectiveness of our approaches in predicting VO2max, especially in older adults.\n\nFurthermore, we noted that RMSE values were consistently lower for women than for men across all algorithms. This observation is likely due to the larger variation in men's VO2max measurements compared to women's. Despite this, the associations between predicted VO2max and all-cause mortality were stronger for men than for women, although the number of deaths in each quartile after stratifying by sex was relatively small.\n\nIn summary, our performance metrics, particularly RMSE, are representative of the current literature and demonstrate the robustness of our machine learning models in predicting VO2max in older adults. The consistent performance across different algorithms and subgroups underscores the reliability of our findings.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our evaluation, we compared our machine learning (ML) algorithms to previously published linear regression models. Specifically, we assessed the performance of these models when used to predict VO2max in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). The root mean square errors (RMSEs) for these ordinary least squares (OLS) models ranged from 5.1 to 20.4 mL/kg/min. After recalibrating these formulas to measured VO2max in the BLSA, the RMSE values decreased significantly, ranging from 3.8 to 4.2 mL/kg/min. This recalibration involved obtaining new regression weights derived from the distribution of covariates in the BLSA.\n\nAdditionally, we compared our algorithms to a recent meta-analysis of 16 VO2max prediction equations using ML. Most of these equations were trained on younger populations and did not use non-exercise predictors. The RMSEs reported in this meta-analysis varied widely, with values such as 2.90 for Support Vector Machine (SVM), 3.14 for multilayer perceptron neural network, and up to 4.78 for multiple input single output models. Notably, the meta-analysis also observed sex differences in RMSEs, similar to those seen in our study.\n\nOur algorithms generally outperformed those in the meta-analysis, with lower RMSE values. For instance, the LASSO and tree-boosted XGBoost algorithms yielded the lowest RMSEs in our study. When restricted to the Objective Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Health Study (OPACH) predictors, LASSO had the lowest RMSE, followed closely by the XGBoost algorithms and SVM. Across all algorithms, the RMSE values for women were lower than for men, likely due to the larger variation in men\u2019s VO2max measurements.\n\nWe also compared the performance of our algorithms using BLSA predictors versus OPACH predictors. Minimal differences in RMSEs were observed, indicating that the variables not measured in OPACH are not critical for accurate VO2max prediction. For example, in the BLSA-predictor random forest algorithms, the 400-m walk time was the most important variable. However, in the OPACH-predictor random forest algorithms, age became the most important variable due to the absence of the 400-m walk measure in OPACH. Despite this, the effectiveness of the OPACH-predictor model was nearly identical, suggesting that age can serve as a proxy for physical performance.\n\nIn summary, our ML algorithms demonstrated superior performance compared to both previously published linear regression models and other ML models from the meta-analysis. The comparison highlights the robustness and accuracy of our approaches in predicting VO2max, especially when considering the differences in predictor availability between the BLSA and OPACH datasets.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our models includes several performance metrics, and we have taken steps to ensure that the results are statistically significant and reliable. The root mean square error (RMSE) is one of the primary metrics used to assess the prediction accuracy of our models. For the total sample, the LASSO and tree-boosted XGBoost algorithms yielded the lowest RMSEs, indicating superior performance. When restricting to the OPACH predictors, LASSO had the lowest RMSE, followed closely by the XGBoost algorithms and SVM.\n\nConfidence intervals are provided for the hazard ratios (HRs) and C-statistics, which are crucial for understanding the statistical significance of our findings. For instance, the C-statistic for the model assessing the association between measured VO2max and all-cause mortality is 0.79 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.75 to 0.83. This indicates a strong predictive performance with a narrow confidence interval, suggesting high reliability.\n\nThe HRs for the quartiles of measured VO2max also come with 95% confidence intervals, providing a clear indication of the statistical significance of the inverse gradient in mortality risk across incremental VO2max quartiles. For example, the HRs for quartile 2 and quartile 3 relative to quartile 1 are 0.55 (0.37 to 0.82) and 0.30 (0.17 to 0.54), respectively, both with p-values less than 0.01, indicating strong statistical significance.\n\nIn the unadjusted models, all predicted VO2max algorithms demonstrated patterns similar to those seen for measured VO2max, showing an inverse gradient in mortality risk across incremental predicted VO2max quartiles. However, after adjusting for Model 2 covariates, the HRs were attenuated, and while the majority of the 95% confidence intervals widened to include 1.0, the significant trend across quartiles persisted for most algorithms.\n\nThe use of multiple machine learning methods allowed for meaningful comparisons of the algorithms' performances. The consistent findings across different models and the provision of confidence intervals for key metrics ensure that our conclusions are robust and statistically significant. This approach enhances the confidence in the superiority of our methods over baselines and other comparative models.",
