  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study primarily consists of data collected from experiments involving the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and egg albumen phantoms. The PAG samples were embedded in gelatin for MRI scanning, and various parameters were measured to ensure reliability and comparability with in vivo data from rodents and retrospective human data.\n\nThe study involved multiple experiments with different power settings (2 W, 3 W, and 4 W) and durations (30 s, 60 s, and 90 s). The repeatability of diameters in the PAG and egg albumen was compared using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). The PAG showed more stable increments in coagulation sizes compared to egg albumen, making it a more reliable phantom for further studies.\n\nIn addition to the phantom data, the study also included in vivo data from two rats and three retrospective human patients with hypothalamic hamartoma. The coagulation sizes were measured under the same conditions (power: 3 W, duration: 60 s) and compared with the results from the PAG phantom. The study found no significant difference between the PAG phantom and real-time MRI lesions in humans, indicating the reliability of the PAG phantom for simulating in vivo conditions.\n\nThe dataset also includes temperature data classified using a decision tree model in MATLAB. The PAG was separated into small pieces, each immersed in water at different temperatures, and the corresponding T1 and T2 values were obtained for temperature classification. This data was used to create a classifier for further temperature distribution analysis.\n\nThe study utilized various software tools for data acquisition and analysis, including MATLAB, 3D Slicer, and FreeSurfer. MRI scans were performed using a 3-T MRI scanner with specific parameters for T1 and turbo T2-weighted spin-echo sequences. The data preprocessing steps included bias field correction and averaging of values across different trials.\n\nIn summary, the dataset consists of experimental data from PAG and egg albumen phantoms, in vivo data from rats and humans, and temperature classification data. The study involved multiple data points collected under various conditions to ensure reliability and comparability. The dataset has not been used in previous papers or by the community, as this is the primary study presenting these findings.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in this study utilizes a decision tree model. This type of model is well-established in the field of machine learning and is not a novel algorithm. Decision trees are commonly used for classification tasks due to their simplicity and interpretability. The decision tree model was implemented using MATLAB, a widely-used software platform for numerical computing and algorithm development.\n\nThe choice to use a decision tree model was driven by the specific requirements of the study, which involved classifying temperature distributions based on T1 and T2 values obtained from MRI scans. The decision tree model was selected for its ability to handle both numerical and categorical data, making it suitable for this type of analysis.\n\nThe decision tree model was trained using the T1 and T2 values as predictors and the corresponding temperatures as the response variable. This approach allowed for the creation of a classifier that could accurately predict temperatures based on the MRI data. The model's performance was evaluated using standard metrics, ensuring its reliability and accuracy.\n\nThe decision tree model was not published in a machine-learning journal because the focus of this study was on the application of radiofrequency thermocoagulation (RF-TC) in neurological disorders, rather than the development of new machine-learning algorithms. The use of the decision tree model was a means to an end, providing a tool to analyze and interpret the data collected during the experiments. The primary contributions of the study lie in the clinical and experimental findings related to RF-TC, rather than the machine-learning techniques employed.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employs a decision tree classifier as part of its temperature analysis, utilizing T1 and T2 values as predictors and temperatures as the response. This approach indicates that the model leverages machine learning techniques to classify and analyze temperature distributions within the PAG.\n\nThe decision tree model is trained using data from PAG samples immersed in water at various temperatures, with each sample corresponding to a specific temperature. The T1 and T2 values obtained from MRI scans of these samples are used to create a classifier that predicts temperatures based on these values. This process involves a single machine learning method, the decision tree, rather than combining multiple machine-learning algorithms as a meta-predictor.\n\nRegarding the independence of training data, the samples are prepared by immersing PAG pieces in water at different temperatures, ensuring that each piece corresponds to a unique temperature. This method suggests that the training data is independent, as each sample is treated separately and corresponds to a distinct temperature condition. The use of a decision tree model further supports the independence of the training data, as the model is trained on individual samples without combining data from different sources or algorithms.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the machine-learning algorithm, data encoding and preprocessing involved several key steps. Initially, the periaqueductal gray (PAG) was divided into small segments, each corresponding to a specific temperature. These segments were then immersed in water at varying temperatures, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were performed to obtain T1 and T2 values for each temperature.\n\nThe T1 and T2 values, which served as predictors, were used alongside the corresponding temperatures as the response variable to train a decision tree model. This model was implemented in MATLAB and was crucial for classifying temperatures based on the MRI data.\n\nPrior to this, several preprocessing steps were undertaken to ensure high-quality analysis. Bias field correction was applied to all T1 and T2 images using the N4ITK MRI Bias Correction module in 3D Slicer software. This step was essential for correcting intensity inhomogeneities in the MRI scans.\n\nAdditionally, the data from different trials were averaged and standardized by adjusting the mean values to a common reference. This standardization facilitated further temperature analysis using machine learning techniques.\n\nFor the video data analysis, RGB coordinates of each pixel were converted into a grayscale system. This conversion assigned a single value to each pixel, which approximately reflected the opacity of the PAG. The degree of opacity was defined as the grayscale value of the pixel divided by the maximum grayscale value, providing a quantitative measure for further investigation.\n\nIn summary, the data encoding and preprocessing involved dividing the PAG into temperature-specific segments, obtaining T1 and T2 values through MRI, applying bias field correction, standardizing the data, and converting RGB coordinates to grayscale for video analysis. These steps ensured that the data was accurately encoded and preprocessed for the machine-learning algorithm.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the model utilized two primary parameters: T1 and T2 values. These parameters were chosen based on their relevance to temperature classification and their availability from MRI scans. The selection of these parameters was driven by the need to create a robust classifier for temperature distribution analysis. The T1 and T2 values were derived from MRI scans of the periaqueductal gray (PAG) samples, which were subjected to various temperatures. This approach allowed for a detailed and accurate temperature classification using a decision tree model implemented in MATLAB. The use of these specific parameters ensured that the model could effectively predict temperatures based on the MRI data, which is crucial for understanding the effects of thermocoagulation in both experimental and clinical settings.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, the input features primarily consisted of T1 and T2 values derived from MRI scans. These values were used as predictors in a decision tree model to classify temperatures. Specifically, each piece of the PAG corresponded to approximately 6300 voxels, resulting in 6300 T1 values and 6300 T2 values for each temperature. This resulted in a total of 12600 features used as input for the machine learning model.\n\nFeature selection was not explicitly performed in the traditional sense, as all T1 and T2 values were used directly as features. However, the focus was on the temperatures, particularly those above 60\u00b0C, where protein denaturation and coagulation necrosis occur. The decision tree model was trained to classify these temperatures based on the T1 and T2 values, effectively using the entire dataset for feature extraction and model training.\n\nThe process ensured that the features were derived and used in a manner that maintained the integrity of the training set, avoiding any contamination from the test set. This approach allowed for a robust analysis of temperature distribution and the size evolution of coagulation fields.",

  "optimization/config": "The study provides detailed information about the configurations and parameters used in the experiments, which are crucial for reproducibility. The general design of the study, including the configurations of the electrodes and the parameters for creating lesioning fields, is presented in Figure 1. The specific manipulations and parameters used for test-retest repetitiveness, such as power settings (2 W, 3 W, and 4 W) and durations (30 s, 60 s, and 90 s), are clearly outlined. The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for the repeatability of diameters in polyacrylamide gel (PAG) and egg albumen are reported, with ICCs of 0.992 for PAG and 0.760 for albumen, indicating the stability and reliability of the PAG phantom.\n\nThe study also includes comparisons between in vitro, animal, and human data, providing coagulation sizes for PAG, animals, and humans under the same conditions (power: 3 W, duration: 60 s). The coagulation sizes were 3.53 mm \u00b1 0.15 mm for PAG, 3.80 mm \u00b1 0.14 mm for animals, and 3.63 mm \u00b1 0.15 mm for humans, demonstrating the comparability of the PAG phantom with real tissues.\n\nAdditionally, the study mentions the use of specific equipment, such as SEEG electrodes and a radiofrequency lesion generator, which are essential for replicating the experiments. The methods for evaluating lesioning areas in albumen and PAG, as well as the assessment of retrospective cases, are described in detail. The study also includes information on the machine learning techniques used for temperature classification and the software tools employed for data analysis, such as MATLAB and FreeSurfer.\n\nHowever, specific model files or optimization schedules are not explicitly mentioned. The study focuses more on the experimental setup and the comparison of phantoms rather than the detailed optimization parameters of a machine learning model. Therefore, while the configurations and parameters for the experiments are available, the optimization parameters for any machine learning models used are not explicitly reported.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a black box; it is designed to be interpretable. A decision tree model was used to classify temperatures based on T1 and T2 values obtained from MRI scans. Decision trees are inherently interpretable because they consist of a series of if-then rules that can be easily visualized and understood. Each node in the tree represents a decision based on a feature (in this case, T1 and T2 values), and the branches represent the possible outcomes of those decisions. This structure allows for a clear understanding of how the model arrives at its predictions.\n\nFor example, the model can be interpreted by tracing the path from the root node to a leaf node, which represents the final temperature classification. At each node, the model checks the value of a specific feature (T1 or T2) and decides which branch to follow based on predefined thresholds. This process continues until a leaf node is reached, which provides the final temperature classification.\n\nAdditionally, the model's interpretability is enhanced by the use of visualizations, such as the decision tree itself, which can be plotted to show the decision-making process. This makes it easier for researchers and clinicians to understand how the model is classifying temperatures and to trust its predictions. The use of decision trees also allows for the identification of the most important features (T1 and T2 values) that contribute to the temperature classification, providing further insights into the underlying mechanisms of the process being studied.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in our study is a classification model. Specifically, we utilized a decision tree model to classify temperatures based on T1 and T2 values obtained from MRI scans. The T1 and T2 values served as predictors, while the temperatures acted as the response variable. This classifier was trained to analyze temperature distributions, with particular attention given to areas where temperatures exceeded 60\u00b0C, as this range is critical for protein denaturation and coagulation necrosis. The model's output facilitated further analysis of temperature distribution within the periaqueductal gray (PAG) tissue.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time for the model varied depending on the specific tasks and analyses performed. For instance, the coagulation process was typically controlled to a duration of 60 seconds to achieve promising results. This duration was adopted for treating patients using the scRF-TC approach, ensuring that temperatures between 60\u00b0C and 78\u00b0C were maintained for effective coagulation.\n\nIn experiments involving multiple contacts, such as one-to-multiple coagulation, six periods of 3 W and 150 seconds each were performed on the central contact, followed by three periods on external contacts. This setup allowed for the creation of coagulation fields with multiple peripheral contacts, demonstrating the feasibility of using the same contact multiple times.\n\nAdditionally, the model's execution time was influenced by the need for 3D MRI reconstruction, video analysis, and temperature analysis. These processes involved complex computations, such as multiplying the number of voxels by the volume of a single voxel in MATLAB and using decision tree models for temperature classification. The video data analysis, for example, focused on the 0-140 second interval, which was consistent across different videos for high-quality analysis.\n\nOverall, the model's execution time was optimized to balance the need for thorough analysis and the practical constraints of clinical application, ensuring that the coagulation process was both effective and efficient.",

The SEEG Assistant module, which was used to decode the coordinates of each contact, can be found on GitHub. Additionally, the 3D Slicer software, which includes the SEEG Assistant module, is also available for download. The FreeSurfer software, used for cortical parcellation of T1 images, is available for download and installation from its official website.

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method involved several key steps to assess the reliability and comparability of the phantoms used in the study. Initially, test-retest repetitiveness was evaluated by comparing the repeatability of diameters in polyacrylamide gel (PAG) and egg albumen under identical manipulations and parameters. This was done using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) to quantify the consistency of the results. The power settings used were 2 W, 3 W, and 4 W, with durations of 30 s, 60 s, and 90 s, respectively.\n\nThe study also compared the coagulation sizes in PAG with those in animals and humans under the same conditions. Specifically, the size index of the \"diameter vertical to the electrode\" was used to compare results from the more stable phantom with lesioning fields in two rats and three retrospective human patients. The power setting for these comparisons was 3 W, with a duration of 60 s.\n\nAdditionally, the study quantified the effective distance, electrode orientations, and one-to-multiple contacts in vitro. Coagulations were performed with contact distances of 3 mm, 5 mm, 7 mm, and 9 mm, using either parallel or vertical electrode arrangements. For one-to-multiple coagulations, a central electrode was used repetitively with six surrounding electrodes placed in a hexagonal shape. Parameters of 3 W and 150 s were employed, and quantitative evaluations of time, size, and temperature distribution were conducted.\n\nThe study further defined homologous and heterologous coagulations, where homologous coagulations involved contacts from the same electrode, and heterologous coagulations involved contacts from different electrodes. Quantitative analyses of size and temperature distribution were evaluated using three strategies: purely homologous coagulations, solely heterologous coagulations, and a combination of both.\n\nThe reliability of the phantoms was assessed by comparing the variance of diameters across different coagulations with the same parameters. The difference between the two manipulations of the same protocol in albumen was significantly higher than in PAG, indicating greater stability in PAG. ICCs were calculated for both phantoms, with PAG showing a higher ICC, further confirming its stability.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation method involved rigorous testing of the phantoms' repeatability and comparability, using both in vitro and in vivo data. The study employed various experimental setups and quantitative analyses to ensure the reliability and applicability of the findings.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we focused on several key performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness and reliability of our methods. One of the primary metrics we reported was the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), which we used to assess the repeatability of lesion diameters in both polyacrylamide gel (PAG) and egg albumen. The ICC values provided a quantitative measure of the stability and consistency of the coagulation fields generated under various conditions. Specifically, we found that PAG exhibited a higher ICC (0.992) compared to egg albumen (0.760), indicating greater stability and reliability.\n\nAnother crucial metric was the size of the coagulation fields, measured in terms of diameter. We compared the coagulation sizes in PAG, animal tissues, and human tissues under identical conditions (3 W power for 60 seconds). The diameters were found to be 3.53 mm \u00b1 0.15 mm in PAG, 3.80 mm \u00b1 0.14 mm in animals, and 3.63 mm \u00b1 0.15 mm in humans. These measurements demonstrated the comparability of PAG with actual tissue responses, validating its use as a phantom material.\n\nWe also evaluated the volume of the lesioning fields created by different configurations of stereo-crossed radiofrequency thermocoagulation (scRF-TC). For instance, using 10 contacts from a pair of parallel electrodes with a power of 3 W, a distance of 5 mm, and a duration of 150 seconds, the scRF-TC created a lesioning field of 1443.34 mm\u00b3. This was significantly larger than the lesion produced by traditional RF-TC (680.17 mm\u00b3), highlighting the enhanced effectiveness of the scRF-TC approach.\n\nAdditionally, we analyzed the temperature distributions during the coagulation process. Most of the temperatures in the confluent coagulation fields were between 60\u00b0C and 78\u00b0C, which is within the range considered effective for coagulation. This temperature data, along with the lesion volumes, provided a comprehensive understanding of the thermal dynamics involved in the scRF-TC procedure.\n\nIn summary, our performance metrics included ICC for repeatability, lesion diameters for comparability, lesion volumes for effectiveness, and temperature distributions for thermal dynamics. These metrics are representative of the standards used in similar studies, ensuring that our findings are both reliable and comparable to existing literature.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we conducted a thorough comparison between two phantoms, polyacrylamide gel (PAG) and egg albumen, to determine which is better suited for radiofrequency thermocoagulation (RF-TC) of the brain. This comparison was essential to address the limitations of albumen as a liquid phantom, which include issues with stability, heat dissipation, and positional changes that affect MRI evaluations.\n\nWe evaluated the repeatability of diameters in both phantoms using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) under identical manipulations and parameters. The results showed that PAG exhibited a more stable increment in coagulation sizes as power or time increased, unlike albumen, which did not follow a consistent power-time related rule. The ICCs for albumen and PAG were 0.760 and 0.992, respectively, indicating that PAG is more reliable.\n\nAdditionally, we compared the coagulation sizes in PAG with those in animal and human tissues under the same conditions. The coagulation sizes in PAG, animals, and humans were 3.53 mm \u00b1 0.15 mm, 3.80 mm \u00b1 0.14 mm, and 3.63 mm \u00b1 0.15 mm in diameter, respectively. This comparison showed no significant difference between PAG and human lesions, suggesting that PAG can effectively mimic human tissue for RF-TC studies.\n\nFurthermore, we performed 3D MRI reconstruction, video analysis, and temperature analysis of coagulations with electrodes of different orientations. These analyses provided quantitative data on the size evolution and temperature distributions, which are crucial for understanding the characteristics of scRF-TC in clinical practice.\n\nIn summary, our methods involved a direct comparison between PAG and albumen, as well as comparisons with animal and human data, to establish the superiority of PAG as a phantom for RF-TC studies. This comprehensive evaluation ensures that our findings are robust and applicable to real-world clinical scenarios.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the phantoms involved a test-retest repetitiveness study to assess the reliability of the polyacrylamide gel (PAG) and egg albumen. The repeatability of diameters in both phantoms was compared using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). The ICC for albumen was 0.760 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.069\u20130.944, while the ICC for PAG was significantly higher at 0.992 with a 95% CI of 0.966\u20130.998. This indicates that PAG demonstrated a more stable and reliable performance compared to albumen.\n\nThe difference between the two phantoms was statistically significant, with a t-value of 2.496 and a p-value of 0.037. This statistical significance supports the claim that PAG is a superior phantom for creating lesioning fields compared to albumen.\n\nAdditionally, the study compared the coagulation sizes in PAG, animals, and humans under the same conditions (3 W power for 60 seconds). The coagulation sizes were 3.53 mm \u00b1 0.15 mm in PAG, 3.80 mm \u00b1 0.14 mm in animals, and 3.63 mm \u00b1 0.15 mm in humans. The comparison showed no significant difference between the PAG and human lesions (p = 0.33), further validating the use of PAG as a reliable phantom for in vitro studies.\n\nThe evaluation also included a detailed analysis of the coagulation fields and temperature distributions using machine learning techniques. The temperature classifier, based on T1 and T2 values, provided a robust method for understanding the temperature distribution within the PAG, which is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of the lesioning process.\n\nOverall, the performance metrics included confidence intervals and statistical significance tests, providing a strong basis for claiming the superiority of PAG over albumen as a phantom for radiofrequency thermocoagulation studies.",
