  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in our study was obtained from a cardiology center in Chennai. This dataset comprises clinical records of 1000 cardiac patients who underwent a Treadmill Test (TMT) for provocable ischemia. The data includes demographic details, risk factor assessments, and comprehensive test results, including treatment and follow-up information. All patient case details were electronically recorded and stored in cloud-based MS-Excel spreadsheets.\n\nThis dataset has been utilized in previous research, specifically in a paper that focused on the classification of cardiology data for the prediction of TMT results. The dataset's richness and comprehensiveness make it a valuable resource for analyzing and predicting cardiovascular conditions. The clinical attributes considered in our study, such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and systemic hypertension, were identified as the most significant factors influencing TMT outcomes. These attributes were selected based on their impact on TMT results, as determined through entropy calculations and data mining techniques.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset used in this study was divided into two main splits: a training set and a test set. The training set consisted of 750 records, while the test set contained 250 records. This division was crucial for developing and validating the prediction methods for the treadmill test (TMT) results.\n\nThe training set was utilized to formulate the prediction method by considering the dependency of various attributes. The test set, on the other hand, was used to evaluate the performance of the formulated method. This approach ensured that the model was trained on a substantial amount of data while also being rigorously tested on a separate set of records to assess its accuracy and reliability.\n\nThe dataset itself was derived from a cardiology clinical dataset acquired from a cardiology center in Chennai. It included demographic details, risk factor assessments, and all test results, including treatment and follow-up details. The data was stored in cloud-based MS-Excel spreadsheets, making it accessible for analysis and processing.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset used in this study consisted of 1000 TMT records, which were separated from a larger cardiology clinical dataset. This dataset was acquired from a cardiology center where TMT was performed on asymptomatic individuals without coronary artery heart disease (CAHD). The records contained demographic details, risk factor assessments, and all test results, including treatment and follow-up details. The data was stored in cloud-based MS-Excel spreadsheets.\n\nTo ensure the robustness of the prediction model, the dataset was divided into a training set and a test set. The training set comprised 750 records, while the test set included 250 records. This split was crucial for developing and validating the prediction method. The training set was used to formulate the prediction method by considering the dependency of the attributes. In contrast, the test set was used to evaluate the performance of the formulated method.\n\nThe independence of the training and test sets was enforced by ensuring that the records in each set were distinct and did not overlap. This separation was essential to prevent data leakage, which could otherwise lead to overoptimistic performance estimates. The distribution of the dataset was designed to reflect real-world scenarios, ensuring that the model's performance could be generalized to new, unseen data.\n\nThe dataset's redundancy was addressed through a pre-processing step that eliminated inconsistent, noisy, and redundant data. This step was vital for improving the quality of the data and ensuring that the prediction model was based on reliable and relevant information. The most significant attributes were identified using entropy calculations, which helped in selecting the six most relevant attributes: age, sex, BMI, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and systemic hypertension. These attributes were then used to develop the prediction model.\n\nThe dataset's distribution was compared to previously published machine learning datasets in the field of cardiology. The focus on minimal clinical attributes and the use of data mining techniques aligned with contemporary research trends. The dataset's structure and the methods used for splitting and pre-processing ensured that the results were comparable to other studies in the field.",
  "dataset/availability": "The dataset used in our study was acquired from a cardiology center in Chennai, where treadmill tests (TMT) were performed on asymptomatic individuals without coronary artery heart disease (CAHD). The patient case details were electronically recorded and contained demographic details, risk factor assessments, and all test results, including details of treatment and follow-up. This data was stored in the cloud as MS-Excel spreadsheets.\n\nThe dataset was not released in a public forum. The data collection and storage processes were managed internally by the cardiology center, ensuring compliance with relevant data protection regulations. Access to the data was restricted to authorized personnel involved in the study to maintain patient confidentiality and data security.\n\nThe dataset was pre-processed to eliminate inconsistent, noisy, and redundant data. From this processed dataset, 1000 TMT records were separated for analysis. The most significant attributes identified for the analysis were age, sex, BMI, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and systemic hypertension. These attributes were finalized using entropy calculations to ensure their relevance to the prediction of TMT results.\n\nThe dataset was divided into a training set of 750 records and a test set of 250 records. The training set was used to formulate prediction methods by considering the dependency of the attributes, while the test data was used to evaluate the formulated methods. This division ensured that the models were trained and tested on separate datasets, providing a robust evaluation of their predictive accuracy.\n\nThe data mining algorithms applied, including Decision Tree, K-Sorting & Searching (KSS), and Curve Fitting, were developed and tested using the training and test sets. The results of these algorithms were compared, and their accuracy was assessed. The final mobile application, \"TMT Predict,\" combined the results of these three methods to improve the overall accuracy of TMT predictions.\n\nIn summary, while the dataset was not made publicly available, it was carefully managed and processed to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the data. The division of the dataset into training and test sets, along with the application of multiple data mining algorithms, provided a comprehensive approach to predicting TMT results.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm used in our study is a modified version of the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm, which we named K-Sorting & Searching (KSS). This algorithm falls under the class of instance-based learning algorithms.\n\nThe KSS algorithm is indeed a new approach, developed to address the limitations of the traditional KNN method, particularly its high time complexity when dealing with large datasets. The KSS algorithm employs a \"Divide and Conquer\" strategy to improve efficiency. It sorts the training data based on a significant numeric attribute and divides it into ranges, allowing for more efficient pattern recognition.\n\nThe reason this algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that the primary focus of our research was on its application in cardiology, specifically for predicting the results of Treadmill Tests (TMT). The development of the KSS algorithm was driven by the need to improve the accuracy and efficiency of TMT predictions using data mining techniques. The algorithm was tailored to handle the specific characteristics of the clinical dataset used in our study. The results of our work were published in the Indian Heart Journal, which is more aligned with the medical and clinical aspects of our research.",
  "optimization/meta": "The \"TMT Predict\" app employs a meta-predictor approach, integrating multiple machine-learning methods to enhance prediction accuracy. The app combines three distinct methods: Decision Tree, K-Sorting & Searching (KSS), and Curve Fitting. Each of these methods is applied independently to predict the results of a Treadmill Test (TMT). The Decision Tree algorithm is used for its ability to handle both numerical and categorical data, providing a clear and interpretable model. The KSS method, a modified version of the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm, is utilized for its effectiveness in pattern recognition. Curve Fitting, a mathematical technique, is applied to improve the accuracy of predictions by fitting a curve to the data points.\n\nThe meta-predictor mechanism in the \"TMT Predict\" app works by comparing the results from these three methods. If the results from the Decision Tree, KSS, and Curve Fitting methods are identical, the app delivers the same result. However, if the results differ, the app considers the two leading results out of the three methods as the final TMT result. This approach ensures that the app leverages the strengths of multiple machine-learning techniques, leading to more robust and accurate predictions.\n\nRegarding the independence of training data, it is clear that the data used for training each method is independent. The training set consisted of 750 records, while the test set included 250 records. This separation ensures that the models are trained on one subset of data and tested on another, preventing overfitting and ensuring the generalizability of the results. The app was further tested prospectively on 300 new patients, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-time environments. This rigorous testing process underscores the reliability and independence of the training data used in the development of the \"TMT Predict\" app.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding process involved converting Boolean attributes into numeric representations. For instance, gender was encoded as 1 for male and 0 for female. Similarly, the presence of diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia was encoded as yes or no, which were then converted into numeric values for the algorithm.\n\nThe data preprocessing steps included eliminating inconsistent, noisy, and redundant data. From the cleaned dataset, 1000 TMT records were selected for analysis. Initially, all clinical attributes were considered, but an analysis of each attribute's impact on TMT results helped identify the most significant ones. These attributes\u2014age, sex, BMI, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and systemic hypertension\u2014were finalized using entropy calculations. This ensured that the most relevant data was used for training and testing the machine-learning algorithms.\n\nThe dataset was divided into a training set of 750 records and a test set of 250 records. The training set was used to develop prediction methods by considering the dependency of the attributes, while the test set was used to evaluate the accuracy of these methods. This division ensured that the model could be trained effectively and then tested on unseen data to assess its performance.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In the optimization process of our model, six clinical attributes were used as input parameters. These parameters were selected based on their significance in predicting the results of a Treadmill Test (TMT). The attributes include age, gender, body mass index (BMI), dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and systemic hypertension. The selection of these parameters was guided by an analysis of the impact of each attribute on TMT results, ultimately finalizing the most significant attributes using entropy calculations. This approach ensured that the model was built on the most relevant and impactful data, enhancing its predictive accuracy.",
  "optimization/features": "In the optimization of our predictive model for treadmill test (TMT) results, we utilized a total of six clinical attributes as input features. These features were carefully selected through a process of feature selection to ensure that only the most significant attributes were included. The selected features are age, gender, body mass index (BMI), presence of diabetes, presence of dyslipidemia, and presence of systemic hypertension.\n\nThe feature selection process was conducted using the training dataset exclusively. This approach helped in identifying the most relevant attributes that contribute to the prediction of TMT results. By focusing on these six attributes, we aimed to simplify the input requirements for our mobile application while maintaining high predictive accuracy. The selection process involved analyzing the impact of each attribute on TMT results and using entropy calculations to finalize the most significant features. This method ensured that the model was trained on a robust set of attributes, leading to improved performance and reliability in predicting TMT outcomes.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study utilized polynomial models to identify relationships between attributes for predicting Treadmill Test (TMT) results. The polynomial functions were derived using the Curve Fitting methodology, executed with MATLAB's Curve Fitting tool. This approach considered attribute combinations such as age and TMT with respect to Body Mass Index (BMI), systemic hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes.\n\nTo address the potential issue of overfitting, the goodness of fit for the polynomial was evaluated using several metrics: Sum of Squared Errors (SSE), R-Square, Adjusted R-Square, and Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSE). These metrics provided a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance and ensured that the polynomial function was not overly complex, thereby mitigating the risk of overfitting.\n\nThe derived polynomial functions were reduced to a single polynomial equation incorporating all attributes, which was then used for the exact prediction of TMT. This reduction process helped in simplifying the model and ensuring that it generalized well to new data, thus avoiding underfitting.\n\nThe accuracy of the Curve Fitting method was found to be 82%, which is a significant improvement over the Decision Tree methodology. This high accuracy indicates that the model was neither overfitted nor underfitted, as it performed well on the test data. Additionally, the model's performance was further validated through real-time testing on 300 new patients, demonstrating its robustness and reliability.",
  "optimization/regularization": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The \"TMT Predict\" app employs a combination of data mining algorithms and mathematical techniques to predict the results of Treadmill Tests (TMT). The model is not entirely a black box, as it incorporates methods that offer some level of interpretability.\n\nThe Decision Tree algorithm, one of the methods used, is inherently interpretable. It operates by creating a tree-like model of decisions, where each node represents a clinical attribute (such as age, gender, or BMI), and each branch represents a possible value of that attribute. The final outcome is determined by navigating through the tree based on the input values. This structure allows for clear visualization and understanding of how the model arrives at its predictions.\n\nAdditionally, the K-Sorting and Searching (KSS) method, a modified version of the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm, provides interpretability by considering the similarity between the input data and the training data. The curve fitting technique, while more mathematical, also contributes to the model's interpretability by fitting a curve to the data points, making the relationships between variables more explicit.\n\nThe app combines the results of these three methods to make a final prediction. If the results from the Decision Tree, KSS, and curve fitting methods are identical, the app delivers that result. Otherwise, it considers the two leading results. This approach enhances the transparency of the model by providing multiple perspectives on the data.\n\nIn summary, the \"TMT Predict\" app leverages interpretable methods like Decision Trees and KSS, along with a mathematical technique like curve fitting, to ensure that the model's predictions are not entirely opaque. This combination allows for a clearer understanding of how the model processes input data to generate outputs.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is primarily a classification model. It is designed to predict the results of a Treadmill Test (TMT), which is a diagnostic tool used to assess the likelihood of coronary artery heart disease (CAHD). The model classifies the TMT results into positive or negative outcomes based on several clinical attributes, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), diabetes, dyslipidemia, and systemic hypertension.\n\nThe classification process involves several data mining techniques, including Decision Tree, K-Sorting & Searching (KSS), and Curve Fitting. These methods are applied to a dataset of cardiac patients to identify patterns and relationships that can predict TMT results accurately. The model's output is a binary classification: positive or negative for CAHD.\n\nThe accuracy of the model was evaluated using a test set of 250 patients, and the results showed that the combined approach of using all three methods in the \"TMT Predict\" app improved the accuracy to 84%. This indicates that the model is effective in classifying TMT results based on the given clinical attributes.\n\nThe app was further tested prospectively on 300 new patients, and the results were correlated with coronary angiogram findings. The high negative predictive value of the app suggests that it is a reliable tool for ruling out CAHD, making it a useful screening instrument in clinical settings.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time of the model was optimized using the K-Sorting & Searching (KSS) algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(n log n). This efficiency was achieved by sorting the training data based on the most significant attribute, age, and then dividing it into different ranges. During testing, the algorithm only searches within the relevant range, significantly reducing the time complexity compared to traditional methods like K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). This optimization ensures that the model can process data quickly, making it suitable for real-time applications such as the \"TMT Predict\" mobile app.",
  "model/availability": "The source code for the algorithms used in the \"TMT Predict\" app is not publicly released. However, the app itself is available for use. It has been tested in real-time environments and is planned to be uploaded to the Google Play Store for patient usage. The app combines three methods: Decision Tree, K-Sorting & Searching (KSS), and Curve Fitting, to predict the results of Treadmill Tests (TMT). It requires only six clinical attributes: age, sex, BMI, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and systemic hypertension. The app is designed to be user-friendly and serves as a screening tool to rule out coronary artery heart disease (CAHD). While the specific details of the software implementation are not provided, the app's functionality and accuracy have been validated through extensive testing.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the \"TMT Predict\" app was conducted through a comprehensive process that involved real-time testing and analysis of predictive values. The app was tested in a real-time environment with 300 new patients. This testing phase was crucial for assessing the app's performance in practical scenarios.\n\nThe evaluation metrics used included positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy. These metrics were calculated using true negative (TN), true positive (TP), false negative (FN), and false positive (FP) values. The formulas used were:\n\n- Accuracy = (TN + TP) / (TN + TP + FN + FP)\n- Positive Predictive Value = TP / (TP + FP)\n- Negative Predictive Value = TN / (TN + FN)\n\nThe results of this evaluation showed that the app had a high negative predictive value, indicating its effectiveness as a screening tool to rule out coronary artery heart disease (CAHD). The sensitivity and specificity of the app were also calculated, providing further insights into its diagnostic capabilities. The sensitivity was found to be 35%, and the specificity was 77%. Additionally, the positive and negative predictive values for the treadmill test (TMT) were 40% and 83%, respectively, while for coronary angiography, they were 52% and 80%.\n\nThe evaluation process also included an analysis of the app's performance across different age groups. It was observed that the accuracy of the app decreased for patients older than 60 years, suggesting the need for further research to identify additional influencing factors in this age group. Conversely, the accuracy improved for the working-age category (30 to 60 years), highlighting the potential for including other compounding risk factors in future versions of the app.\n\nOverall, the evaluation demonstrated that the \"TMT Predict\" app is a reliable and user-friendly tool for predicting the results of the treadmill test, with a strong negative predictive value that makes it suitable for initial screening of CAHD.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of the \"TMT Predict\" app, several key performance metrics were reported to assess its effectiveness in predicting the results of the Treadmill Test (TMT) and correlating with coronary angiogram results. The primary metrics used were accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV).\n\nAccuracy was calculated as the proportion of true positive and true negative results out of the total number of cases. This metric provides an overall measure of the app's performance in correctly predicting both positive and negative TMT results.\n\nSensitivity, also known as the true positive rate, measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified by the app. This metric is crucial for understanding how well the app can detect true positive cases of TMT.\n\nSpecificity, or the true negative rate, measures the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified. This metric is important for assessing the app's ability to correctly identify true negative cases, which is particularly relevant for ruling out coronary artery heart disease (CAHD).\n\nThe positive predictive value (PPV) indicates the probability that patients with a positive test result truly have the condition. Conversely, the negative predictive value (NPV) indicates the probability that patients with a negative test result do not have the condition. These metrics are essential for understanding the clinical utility of the app in real-world settings.\n\nThe reported metrics are representative of standard performance measures used in the literature for evaluating diagnostic tools and predictive models in cardiology. The inclusion of sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV ensures a comprehensive assessment of the app's diagnostic accuracy and its potential clinical impact. The high NPV of the app, in particular, highlights its utility as a screening tool to rule out CAHD, which is a significant contribution to the field.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we employed multiple data mining techniques to predict the results of Treadmill Tests (TMT). We compared the performance of three distinct methods: Decision Tree, K-Sorting & Searching (KSS), and Curve Fitting. Each method was evaluated independently on a clinical dataset consisting of records from 1000 cardiac patients.\n\nThe Decision Tree method was applied to a classified and clustered dataset, converting it into classification IF-THEN rules. This approach yielded an accuracy of 73%. To enhance accuracy, we explored alternative algorithms, leading to the development of the KSS algorithm, a modified version of the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) method. KSS uses a \"Divide and Conquer\" strategy, significantly improving efficiency and accuracy. When applied to the TMT dataset, KSS achieved an accuracy of 78%.\n\nAdditionally, we implemented a Curve Fitting method using polynomial models to identify mathematical relationships between attributes for TMT result prediction. This method demonstrated an accuracy of 82%, showing a 9% improvement over the Decision Tree methodology.\n\nTo further improve predictive performance, we developed an Android mobile application called \"TMT Predict.\" This app combines the results of the Decision Tree, KSS, and Curve Fitting methods. If the results from all three methods are identical, the app delivers the same result. Otherwise, it considers the two leading results as the final TMT prediction. This combined approach increased the overall accuracy to 84%.\n\nThe app was tested in real-time with 300 new patients, and its performance was evaluated using metrics such as positive and negative predictive values, sensitivity, and specificity. The results indicated that the app is a reliable screening tool for ruling out coronary artery heart disease (CAHD), particularly due to its high negative predictive value.\n\nNot applicable.",

  "evaluation/availability": "The evaluation of the \"TMT Predict\" app was conducted using a real-time test set of 300 new patients. The results of this evaluation, including true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, were used to calculate various metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. These results were tabulated and discussed in the publication.\n\nHowever, the raw evaluation files themselves are not publicly available. The data used for the evaluation was collected from a cardiology center and includes sensitive patient information.
