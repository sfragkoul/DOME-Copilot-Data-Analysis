  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in our study is sourced from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB), which is a comprehensive repository of immune epitope data. For HLA-A*24-02 bound to 10-mer peptides, we utilized 293 sequences with a dissociation constant (kD) greater than 6500 nM. Similarly, for HLA-A*32-01 bound to 9-mer peptides, we had access to 831 nonameric sequences with varying binding affinities. For HLA-A*23-01 bound to 10-mer peptides, 580 decameric sequences were available, while HLA-B*44-03 with 9-mers included 733 nonameric sequences. Additionally, HLA-B*27-05 with 10-mers provided 317 decameric sequences. For HLA-A*23-01 bound to 9-mer peptides, we had 1915 nonameric sequences.\n\nThe datasets were curated to include peptides with known binding affinities, categorized into different binding ranges based on their kD values. These datasets have been used in previous studies and by the community to validate binding predictions and understand peptide-MHC interactions. For instance, the Bjerregaard et al. curated dataset (PMID: 29187854) consists of 290 neopeptides that are HLA-A*02-01 binders, and the Ko\u015falo\u011flu-Yal\u00e7\u0131n et al. curated dataset (PMID: 30377561) includes 195 HLA-A*02-01-nonamer complexes. These datasets have been instrumental in evaluating the performance of binding prediction methods, including NetMHCpan, which is widely used in the immunoinformatics community. The datasets were balanced and held-out test datasets were created to ensure no overlap between training and test sequences, providing a robust framework for validating our methods.",
  "dataset/splits": "In our study, we employed multiple data splits to ensure robust training and testing of our models. For HLA-A*24-02, we selected 19 very strongly binding peptides as the training set. A balanced held-out test dataset was created by randomly selecting 66 peptides from each binding class, ensuring no overlap between the training and test sets.\n\nFor HLA-A*32-01, we used 74 very strongly binding peptides as the training set. The test dataset was balanced by randomly selecting 100 peptides from each binding class, except for the weak binding class, where all 96 peptides were included. Again, there was no overlap between the training and test sequences.\n\nIn the case of HLA-B*44-03, 40 very strongly binding peptides were used for training. The test dataset consisted of 80 peptides randomly selected from each binding class, with no overlap between training and test sequences.\n\nFor HLA-B*27-05, the training set included 16 very strongly binding peptides. The test dataset was balanced with 50 peptides from each binding class, ensuring no overlap with the training set.\n\nFor HLA-A*23-01 bound to 9-mer peptides, 100 very strongly binding peptides were selected for training. The test dataset was balanced with 90 peptides from each binding class, with no overlap between training and test sequences.\n\nFor HLA-A*23-01 bound to 10-mer peptides, the training set included a smaller number of peptides due to the limited availability of binding observations. The test dataset was balanced accordingly, ensuring no overlap with the training set.\n\nAdditionally, we tested our methods on curated datasets from Bjerregaard et al. and Ko\u015falo\u011flu-Yal\u00e7\u0131n et al., which included peptides with known immunogenicity but unknown experimental binding affinities. These datasets were used to compare the performance of our method with NetMHCpan predictions.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets used in this study were carefully split to ensure independence between training and test sets. For the HLA-A*24-02 allele, a balanced held-out test dataset was created by randomly selecting 66 peptides from each binding class, with no overlap between sequences in the training and test sets. This approach ensures that the test set is independent of the training data, providing an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance.\n\nFor the HLA-A*32-01 allele, a similar strategy was employed. A balanced held-out test dataset was created by randomly selecting 100 peptides from each binding class, except for the weak binding class, where all 96 peptides were selected. Again, there was no overlap between sequences in the training and test sets, ensuring independence.\n\nThe distribution of peptides in the different binding ranges as predicted by NetMHCpan was analyzed for datasets with known immunogenicity. The Bjerregaard dataset, for example, consists of 290 neopeptides that are HLA-A*02-01 binders. Out of these, 239, 49, and 2 neopeptides were predicted to belong to the very strong, strong, and weak binding ranges, respectively. This distribution is similar to what has been observed in previously published machine learning datasets, where a significant proportion of peptides fall into the very strong binding category.\n\nThe Ko\u015falo\u011flu-Yal\u00e7\u0131n dataset, which contains 195 HLA-A*02-01-nonamer complexes, also follows a similar distribution. Out of the 78 T cell epitopes in this dataset, 20, 40, and 18 were mutated cancer epitopes, non-mutated cancer epitopes, and viral epitopes, respectively. The distribution of peptides in the different binding ranges as predicted by NetMHCpan is analyzed to ensure that the datasets are representative of real-world scenarios.\n\nIn summary, the datasets were split to ensure independence between training and test sets, with no overlap between sequences. The distribution of peptides in the different binding ranges is comparable to previously published machine learning datasets, providing a robust basis for evaluating the performance of the models.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our study leverages machine learning techniques, specifically artificial neural networks, to predict peptide-MHC binding affinities. This class of algorithms has been widely used in the field due to their ability to capture complex patterns in data.\n\nThe machine-learning algorithm used is not entirely new; it builds upon established methods that have been refined and improved over time. The integration of mass spectrometric (MS) peptide elution data along with binding affinity measurements has enhanced the accuracy of these predictions. Tools like NetMHCpan and MHCflurry have adopted this approach, demonstrating superior performance compared to other machine learning methods.\n\nThe reason this algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that the focus of our work is on its application in immunology, particularly in the context of peptide-MHC binding prediction. The primary goal is to improve the identification of potential vaccine candidates and understand antigen interactions, rather than the development of novel machine-learning techniques per se. The algorithm's effectiveness in this specific biological context is the key contribution of our study.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model described in this publication is a meta-predictor that combines sequence-based and structure-based methods to enhance the prediction of peptide-MHC binding affinities. The sequence-based component leverages machine learning tools that have been trained on various data sources, including sequence-derived features, position-specific matrices, and binding affinity measurements from databases like the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). Additionally, some of these tools incorporate mass spectrometric (MS) peptide elution data to improve their predictive power.\n\nThe structure-based component involves atomistically detailed structural modeling, which provides mechanistic insights into peptide-MHC interactions. This approach models the conformation of the peptide in the MHC binding groove and uses methods such as correlating binding affinities with physicochemical descriptors in quantitative-structure activity relationships.\n\nThe combined method integrates the outputs of these two approaches. The sequence-based method initially screens peptides, and then the structure-based method refines these predictions by evaluating the structural fit and stability of the peptide-MHC complexes. This combined approach aims to increase the positive predictive value (PPV) and reduce the number of false positives, thereby improving the overall accuracy of the predictions.\n\nRegarding the independence of training data, it is not explicitly stated whether the training data for the sequence-based and structure-based components are entirely independent. However, the structure-based method is designed to be applicable even when training data is scarce, which suggests that it can operate with minimal overlap in training datasets. This design helps to mitigate the issue of data scarcity and improves the model's applicability to a broader range of MHC alleles.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, the data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several key steps. Initially, we utilized sequence-derived features of peptides, which included position-specific matrices and binding affinity measurements. These measurements were sourced from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) and other relevant databases. Additionally, mass spectrometric (MS) peptide elution data were incorporated into the training process to enhance the accuracy of our predictions.\n\nThe sequence-based methods relied heavily on the availability of large datasets with even sequence coverage and expansive binding affinity ranges. This was crucial for training the models to predict peptide binding to various MHC alleles. However, for alleles with scarce data, we employed a \"pan-allele\" approach, such as that used in NetMHCpan, which trains on a broader set of alleles rather than individual predictors for each allele. This method helped mitigate the issue of data scarcity.\n\nFor the structure-based approach, we focused on atomistically detailed structural models of peptide-MHC complexes. These models provided mechanistic insights into peptide-MHC interactions by correlating binding affinities with physicochemical descriptors. The structural modeling involved generating conformational analyses of peptides in the MHC binding groove, which were then used to discriminate between strong and weak binding peptides.\n\nIn practice, the structure-based method was not limited by the availability of large datasets. For example, our training dataset for the structure-based method consisted of only a few peptide sequences for certain alleles, such as HLA-B*44-03 with 9-mers, HLA-B*27-05 with 10-mers, and HLA-A*23-01 with 10-mers. This flexibility allowed us to apply the method to peptides of any profile length and to any MHC allele, even those lacking crystal structures. In such cases, homology models were generated from the closest sequence homolog for which a structure had been determined.\n\nOverall, the combination of sequence-based and structure-based methods provided a robust framework for predicting peptide-MHC binding affinities, addressing the limitations of each approach individually.",

  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations, optimization schedule, and model files are not explicitly detailed in the provided information. However, it is mentioned that example scripts for generating p-MHC models with MODELLER and Rosetta FlexPepDock, along with the dataset of 1271 peptides that were modeled, will be provided upon request. This suggests that while the specific configurations and parameters are not openly available, they can be obtained by reaching out to the authors.\n\nThe software packages used for the molecular modeling, including Rosetta FlexPepDock, are freely available for academic use. Additionally, Rosetta FlexPepDock is accessible in web server form, which implies that the tools necessary for replication and further study are accessible to the research community.\n\nThe input parameters used for Rosetta FlexPepDock are provided in the Supporting Information, indicating that detailed optimization parameters are documented and can be referred to by interested parties. This level of transparency supports the reproducibility of the methods described in the study.\n\nIn summary, while the exact hyper-parameter configurations and optimization schedules are not openly published, they are available upon request and the necessary software tools are freely accessible for academic use. This approach ensures that the methods can be replicated and built upon by other researchers in the field.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model presented in our work is not a black-box but rather a transparent approach that combines sequence-based and structure-based methods to predict peptide-MHC binding affinities. The sequence-based component utilizes NetMHCpan4.0, which is an artificial neural network trained on large datasets of peptide binding affinities. This component provides insights into the linear sequence motifs that are important for binding.\n\nThe structure-based component involves molecular modeling and flexible docking of peptides to MHC molecules using Rosetta FlexPepDock. This approach generates ensembles of conformations for each peptide-MHC complex, allowing for the analysis of conformational flexibility and binding energy contributions. The conformational flexibility of peptides in high-affinity complexes is observed to be lower, indicating that these peptides bind in a more specific conformation. This structural information provides a clear, interpretable basis for the binding predictions.\n\nFor example, the model can differentiate between binding and non-binding peptides by analyzing the conformational similarity of the docked peptides. High-affinity peptides tend to adopt similar conformations that are also similar to those observed in crystal structures, whereas low-affinity peptides show more variability in their conformations. This structural insight is not available from sequence-based methods alone and adds a layer of interpretability to the model's predictions.\n\nAdditionally, the model's performance can be visualized through metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV). The combined sequence and structure-based approach shows a statistically significant improvement in PPV compared to the sequence-based method alone. This improvement is due to the model's ability to capture both the sequence motifs and the structural features that contribute to high-affinity binding.\n\nIn summary, the model's transparency comes from its use of interpretable structural data and well-established sequence-based methods. The combination of these approaches provides a comprehensive and interpretable framework for predicting peptide-MHC binding affinities.",
  "model/output": "The model discussed in this publication is primarily focused on classification rather than regression. It aims to predict whether peptides will bind to specific Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) alleles, categorizing them into binders and non-binders. The classification is based on experimental dissociation constants, with thresholds used to define strong, weak, and non-binding peptides. For instance, peptides with a dissociation constant (kD) of \u2264100 nM are considered very strong binders, while those with kD > 6500 nM are considered non-binders. The model uses a combination of sequence-based predictions from tools like NetMHCpan 4.0 and structure-based modeling to improve the accuracy of these classifications. The structure-based approach involves generating molecular models of peptide-MHC complexes and analyzing the conformational variability of the peptide backbones to correlate with binding affinities. This dual approach helps in reducing false positives, thereby enhancing the specificity and positive predictive value of the binding predictions. The final output of the model is a classification of peptides into binders and non-binders, with an emphasis on identifying strong binders for vaccine design.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time for the structure-based method is quite efficient. Docking and generating 1000 models of each peptide to the MHC using Rosetta FlexPepDock takes approximately 90 minutes on a single node with a 2.33-GHz Intel Xeon 32-core processor. This efficiency allows for the screening of roughly 30,000 tumor or viral genomes in a single day on a high-performance supercomputer, such as the Summit at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which has a capacity of around 100 petaflops. This capability makes it feasible to execute the combined sequence and structure-based method on a massive scale, provided that whole exome sequencing of viruses or tumors can be performed rapidly.",
  "model/availability": "The software packages used for the molecular modeling in this study are freely available for academic use. Specifically, Rosetta FlexPepDock is accessible in web server form, providing an easy-to-use interface for researchers. Additionally, example scripts for generating p-MHC models with MODELLER and Rosetta FlexPepDock are available upon request. The input parameters used for Rosetta FlexPepDock are provided in the Supporting Information, ensuring reproducibility and accessibility for other researchers interested in applying similar methods.",
  "evaluation/method": "The method was evaluated using a combination of approaches to ensure its robustness and applicability. For straightforward cases, such as HLA-A*02-01-nonameric complexes, where template crystal structures and sufficient training data were available, the method was tested directly. For more challenging cases, like HLA-A*23-01-decameric complexes, where no template crystal structure existed and only a few strongly binding sequences were used for training, the method was also evaluated.\n\nThe performance of the sequence-based method, NetMHCpan, was assessed for its sensitivity and positive predictive value. It was found to pick almost all peptides from the very strong binding class and very few from the non-binding class. However, it is important to note that the peptides tested were part of the training data for NetMHCpan but were non-overlapping with the training set for the structure-based method.\n\nThe combined approach, which involves filtering peptides using the sequence-based method followed by the structure-based method, showed an average 8% gain in positive predictive value. This means that the probability of a predicted binder actually binding with a dissociation constant (kD) of \u2264 100 nM increased.\n\nAdditionally, the method was applied to datasets of peptides with known immunogenicity from Bjerregaard et al. and Ko\u015falo\u011flu-Yal\u00e7\u0131n et al. The combined sequence and structure-based approach was used to predict the binding of 485 peptides. The goal was to determine if selecting the highest affinity MHC binders using the combined approach could increase the likelihood of picking an actual immunogenic peptide for inclusion in a vaccine.\n\nThe Bjerregaard dataset contains human immunogenic and non-immunogenic neopeptides derived from single amino acid substitutions, while the Ko\u015falo\u011flu-Yal\u00e7\u0131n dataset contains known, naturally processed, immunogenic neoepitopes and random peptides. For both datasets, HLA-A*02-01 allele-restricted peptides were selected due to the abundance of data for this allele, which is relevant for statistical validation.\n\nThe performance metrics used for evaluation included sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV). Sensitivity measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified, specificity measures the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified, and PPV measures the proportion of predicted positives that are actual positives. The true labels for peptides were determined using the threshold kD \u2264 100 nM.\n\nThe combined method was also evaluated for its ability to reduce the average dissociation constant of predicted binders and to decrease the probability of false positives in the non-binding range. The results showed that the combined method improved the positive predictive value and reduced the average dissociation constant of predicted binders by about 700 nM.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our evaluation, we focused on several key performance metrics to assess the effectiveness of our prediction methods. These metrics include sensitivity, specificity, and the positive predictive value (PPV), also known as precision. Sensitivity is calculated as the ratio of true positives (TP) to the sum of true positives and false negatives (FN), indicating the ability of the method to correctly identify binders. Specificity is the ratio of true negatives (TN) to the sum of true negatives and false positives (FP), reflecting the method's ability to correctly identify non-binders. PPV, or precision, is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives, providing insight into the likelihood that a predicted binder is indeed a binder.\n\nWe also evaluated the performance of our methods using a 500-nM dissociation constant cutoff, which is a common threshold in the field. The improvement in PPV when using the combined sequence and structure-based method was found to be statistically significant, with a p-value of 0.027 as determined by a chi-squared test. This indicates that the combined approach enhances the precision of binder prediction compared to using the sequence-based method alone.\n\nAdditionally, we examined the fraction of binders that fall into different ranges of experimental dissociation constants. This analysis helps to understand how well our methods distinguish between strong binders and weaker or non-binders. The combined method showed a higher probability of correctly identifying strong binders (kD \u2264 100 nM) and a lower probability of false positives in the non-binding range compared to the sequence-based method alone.\n\nOverall, the set of metrics we reported is representative of standard practices in the literature, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the predictive performance of our methods. The inclusion of sensitivity, specificity, and PPV, along with the analysis of dissociation constant ranges, ensures that our evaluation is thorough and comparable to other studies in the field.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "A comparison to publicly available methods was performed using benchmark datasets. Specifically, the pan-allele sequence-based method, NetMHCpan, was compared to a structure-based method. This comparison demonstrated that NetMHCpan exhibits high sensitivity and outperforms the structure-based method in picking almost all peptides from the very strong binding class and very few from the non-binding class.\n\nAdditionally, a combined approach was evaluated, where peptides are first filtered using the sequence-based approach and then the structure-based approach is applied to the filtered peptides. This combined method showed an average 8% gain in the positive predictive value, indicating a higher probability that a predicted binder will actually bind with a dissociation constant (kD) of \u2264 100 nM.\n\nThe combined sequence and structure-based approach was also applied to predicting the binding of 485 peptides of known immunogenicity from curated datasets. This evaluation included assessing the likelihood of picking an actual immunogenic peptide for inclusion in a vaccine and the reproducibility of the methods in selecting the highest affinity binders.\n\nThe performance of the sequence-based, structure-based, and combined methods was evaluated using diagnostic tests, which are provided in the Supporting Information. These tests include sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value, with the combined method showing improved performance in selecting very strong binders.\n\nNot applicable.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our methods includes statistical significance testing to determine if the improvements are meaningful. For instance, the positive predictive value (PPV) improvement when using the combined sequence and structure-based approach over the sequence-based method alone is statistically significant with a p-value of 0.027, as determined by a chi-squared test. This indicates that the enhancement in PPV is not due to random chance.\n\nHowever, confidence intervals for the performance metrics are not explicitly provided in the main text. The results are expressed as means \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM) or ranges, where appropriate, but specific confidence intervals for metrics like sensitivity, specificity, and PPV are not detailed. The statistical analysis focuses on comparing the methods using tests like the chi-squared test to assess significance.\n\nThe performance metrics are evaluated using a held-out test dataset, which helps in providing an unbiased estimate of the model's performance. The dataset includes equal numbers of true negatives and true positives, although it is noted that this might underestimate the improvement in PPV compared to a more realistic dataset with many true negatives.\n\nIn summary, while statistical significance is considered and reported for key comparisons, detailed confidence intervals for the performance metrics are not provided. The evaluation emphasizes the significance of improvements in predictive performance, particularly in terms of PPV.",
