  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was collected preoperatively from the institute of anal-colorectal surgery of a specific hospital from October 2006 to March 2008. The study involved 150 patients diagnosed with colorectal sporadic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, with no evidence of other diseases. The clinical stages of the patients were distributed as follows: 31 cases at stage I, 58 at stage IIa, 16 at stage IIb, 8 at stage IIIa, 84 at stage IIIb, and 13 at stage IIIc.\n\nThe dataset included sera from node-positive and node-negative colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. The node-positive group consisted of 49 men and 56 women, with an average age of 58.4 years, while the node-negative group consisted of 51 men and 54 women, with an average age of 56.4 years. The samples were age- and gender-matched.\n\nThe dataset was divided into a training set and a test set using a case-control study design. The training set included 70 sera from node-positive CRC patients and 75 from node-negative CRC patients, collected from October 2006 to September 2007. The test set included 35 sera from node-positive CRC patients and 30 from node-negative CRC patients, collected from October 2007 to March 2008.\n\nA quality control sample was provided by a healthy volunteer and used to determine reproducibility and serve as a control protein profile for each SELDI-TOF-MS experiment. The blood samples were collected by venipuncture, processed, and stored at -80\u00b0C until use.\n\nThe dataset has not been used in previous papers or by the community, as this study represents the initial analysis and classification of the serum protein profiles for node-positive and node-negative CRC patients.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into two main splits: a training set and a test set. The training set consisted of spectra data from 75 node-negative colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and 70 node-positive CRC patients. The test set included spectra data from 35 node-positive CRC patients and 30 node-negative CRC patients. The samples were collected from October 2006 to March 2008, with the training set samples collected from October 2006 to September 2007, and the test set samples collected from October 2007 to March 2008. The node-positive CRC patients and node-negative patients were age- and gender-matched.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset was collected preoperatively from the institute of anal-colorectal surgery of a specific hospital from October 2006 to March 2008. The study involved 150 patients diagnosed with colorectal sporadic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, with no evidence of other diseases. The clinical stages of the patients were distributed as follows: 31 cases at stage I, 58 at stage IIa, 16 at stage IIb, 8 at stage IIIa, 84 at stage IIIb, and 13 at stage IIIc.\n\nThe dataset was split into a training set and a test set using a case-control study design, based on the collection dates. The training set included 70 sera from node-positive CRC patients and 75 from node-negative CRC patients, collected from October 2006 to September 2007. The test set included 35 sera from node-positive CRC patients and 30 from node-negative CRC patients, collected from October 2007 to March 2008.\n\nThe training and test sets are independent, as they were collected during different time periods. This independence was enforced by the temporal separation of the data collection periods. The distribution of the datasets compares favorably to previously published machine learning datasets in terms of ensuring independence between training and test sets, which is crucial for validating the performance of the classification algorithm. The age and gender of the patients in the node-positive and node-negative groups were matched, further ensuring the comparability and robustness of the datasets.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data used in this study were collected preoperatively from the Institute of Anal-Colorectal Surgery of the 150th Hospital of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) between October 2006 and March 2008. The study involved 150 patients diagnosed with colorectal sporadic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, with no evidence of other diseases. The dataset was divided into training and test sets based on the collection dates. The training set included 70 sera from node-positive CRC patients and 75 from node-negative CRC patients, collected from October 2006 to September 2007. The test set included 35 sera from node-positive CRC patients and 30 from node-negative CRC patients, collected from October 2007 to March 2008.\n\nThe data splits were enforced by separating the samples according to the collection dates, ensuring that the training and test sets were independent of each other. This approach helped in validating the classification algorithm's performance on unseen data.\n\nThe data, including the data splits used, are not released in a public forum. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the 150th Hospital PLA, and all CRC patients involved in the study signed an agreement form consenting to the donation of their specimens. The data were used solely for the purposes of this study and were not made publicly available.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in this study is a classification tree algorithm. This type of algorithm is well-established in the field of machine learning and is used for dividing datasets into different classes based on multiple rounds of decision-making.\n\nThe classification tree algorithm used here is not a new development but rather a proven method that has been adapted for the specific context of differentiating between node-positive and node-negative colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. The algorithm was implemented using the Biomarker Pattern Software, which is designed to handle spectral data and develop classification models.\n\nThe reason this algorithm was not published in a machine-learning journal is that the focus of this work is on its application in medical diagnostics, specifically in the context of CRC node-staging. The primary contribution of this study is the demonstration of how this algorithm can be effectively used to analyze serum protein profiles to distinguish between different stages of CRC. The innovation lies in the application of the algorithm to this particular medical problem, rather than in the development of a new machine-learning technique.",
  "optimization/meta": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure the spectral data was suitable for analysis. Initially, the mass-to-charge (m/z) range from 0 to 2,000 was excluded from the analysis due to it being primarily signal noise from the energy-absorbing molecule. The spectral data was then normalized to total ion current after background subtraction. The range of peak masses was set between m/z 2,000 and 20,000, as this range contained the majority of resolved protein/peptides.\n\nThe Biomarker Wizard Software was used for peak detection and clustering across all spectra in both the training and test sets. For peak detection, a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 and a minimum peak threshold of 20% were applied. For cluster completion, a cluster threshold of 0.5% and a signal-to-noise ratio of 2 were used for the second pass. The spectral data was then exported as spreadsheet files.\n\nThe training set spectral data was further analyzed using the Biomarker Pattern Software to develop a classification tree. This tree was designed to divide the training dataset into node-positive CRC patients and node-negative patients through multiple rounds of decision-making in training mode. The dataset initially formed a \"root node,\" and the software identified the best peak to separate this dataset into two \"child nodes\" based on intensity. This process continued for each child node until a sample entered a terminal node, which was labeled as either node-positive or node-negative.",
  "optimization/parameters": "The model utilized a classification tree that was developed using specific input parameters. The classification tree employed two splitters, which correspond to distinct masses at m/z 3,104, 3,781, 5,867, 7,970, and 9,290. These splitters were used to classify the samples into terminal nodes, resulting in a total of three terminal nodes. The selection of these parameters was based on their ability to yield the least classification error when combined, ensuring the optimal performance of the model. The process involved multiple rounds of decision-making to divide the dataset into node-positive and node-negative patients, with the goal of achieving the highest accuracy and reliability in the classification.",
  "optimization/features": "The study utilized a specific range of mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios for feature detection, focusing on the range from 2,000 to 20,000. Within this range, 46 peak clusters or common peaks were identified using the Biomarker Wizard Software. These peaks were detected across all spectra in both the training and test sets. The software settings for peak detection included a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 and a minimum peak threshold of 20%. For cluster completion, the cluster threshold was set at 0.5%, and the signal-to-noise ratio for the second pass was 2.\n\nFeature selection was implicitly performed during the process of developing the classification tree. The Biomarker Pattern Software was used to analyze the spectral data of the training set, aiming to develop a classification tree that could distinguish between node-positive and node-negative colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. The software identified peaks that yielded the least classification error when combined, ensuring that only the most relevant features were used. This process involved multiple rounds of decision-making to create a model that effectively separated the datasets into the desired categories.\n\nThe classification tree ultimately used 5 distinct masses (m/z 3,104, 3,781, 5,867, 7,970, and 9,290) as splitters, indicating that these specific features were deemed most important for the classification task. The feature selection process was conducted using only the training set, ensuring that the model's performance could be validated independently using the test set. This approach helped in creating a robust and reliable classification algorithm.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study involved the use of a classification tree developed through the Biomarker Pattern Software. The dataset was divided into a training set and a test set to ensure robust model validation.\n\nThe training set consisted of spectra data from 75 node-negative CRC patients and 70 node-positive patients, while the test set included data from 35 node-positive patients and 30 node-negative patients. This division helped in evaluating the model's performance on unseen data, thereby mitigating the risk of overfitting.\n\nThe classification tree was constructed using multiple rounds of decision-making, where the dataset was divided into node-positive and node-negative patients based on peak intensities. The process involved identifying the best peak to separate the dataset into child nodes, with intensity thresholds set accordingly. This iterative process continued until each sample entered a terminal node, labeled as either node-positive or node-negative.\n\nTo address the potential issue of overfitting, cross-validation was performed. The classification algorithm achieved high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in both the training and test sets. Specifically, the algorithm correctly classified 93.85% of the total testing samples, demonstrating its ability to generalize well to new data.\n\nUnderfitting was ruled out by ensuring that the classification tree was complex enough to capture the underlying patterns in the data. The tree used multiple splitters with distinct masses, indicating a detailed and nuanced model. The optimal classification tree was selected based on the lowest error cost, ensuring that it was neither too simple nor too complex.\n\nIn summary, the fitting method involved a balanced approach to model complexity, with cross-validation and a separate test set used to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability. This approach helped in ruling out both overfitting and underfitting, resulting in a reliable classification algorithm.",
  "optimization/regularization": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters used in this study are available through the description of the methods employed. The Biomarker Wizard Software was used for peak detection and clustering with specific settings: a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 and a minimum peak threshold of 20% for peak detection, and a cluster completion setting of 0.5% with a signal-to-noise ratio of 2 for the second pass. These details are provided to ensure reproducibility of the results.\n\nThe Biomarker Pattern Software (version 4.0) was utilized to develop a classification tree, which involved multiple rounds of decision-making to divide the training dataset into node-positive and node-negative CRC patients. The classification tree's setup and the decision-making process are described, including how the dataset was initially formed into a \"root node\" and subsequently divided into \"child nodes\" based on peak intensity thresholds.\n\nThe spectral data were normalized and analyzed within a specific mass-to-charge (m/z) range of 2,000 to 20,000, excluding the range from 0 to 2,000 due to signal noise. The entire dataset was separated into training and test sets, with the training set used to construct the classification tree and the test set used to evaluate its discriminatory ability.\n\nThe performance of the classification algorithm was summarized for both the training and test sets, including accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The reproducibility of the SELDI protein chip assay spectra was determined using a quality control serum sample, with coefficients of variance (CVs) reported for both intra-assay and interassay measurements.\n\nHowever, specific model files or optimization schedules are not explicitly mentioned as being available for download or further use. The methods and parameters are described in detail within the publication, but there is no indication of an external repository or license for accessing the exact files used in the analysis.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a black-box but rather a transparent decision tree-based classifier. This transparency is achieved through the use of a pattern-matching algorithm that distinguishes between node-positive and node-negative colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. The algorithm operates by identifying specific mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) in serum protein profiles, which are then used to create a classification tree.\n\nThe decision tree is constructed using distinct m/z values, such as 3,104, 3,781, 5,867, 7,970, and 9,290. These values are combined in linear equations to determine the classification of patients. For instance, the left branch after the first node is defined by the linear combination of these m/z values being less than or equal to 1.122, while the right branch is defined by values greater than 1.122. This process continues through subsequent nodes, each with its own set of conditions based on m/z values and their intensities.\n\nThe terminal nodes of the tree provide clear classifications: patients meeting the conditions of terminal node 1 and terminal node 3 are diagnosed as node-positive CRC patients, while those meeting the conditions of terminal node 2 are diagnosed as node-negative CRC patients. This structured approach allows for a clear understanding of how each m/z value contributes to the final classification, making the model interpretable and transparent.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a classification model. It was designed to distinguish between node-positive and node-negative colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. The classification tree, created using the Biomarker Pattern Software, divides the dataset into these two categories through a series of decision-making steps based on peak intensities at specific mass-to-charge ratios (m/z). The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, which are typical for classification tasks. The final model achieved high accuracy in both the training and test sets, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying CRC patients based on their lymph node involvement.",

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method for the classification algorithm involved several steps to ensure its validity and accuracy. Initially, the algorithm was trained on a dataset consisting of 145 serum samples, achieving 100% accuracy in learning mode. This dataset was then cross-validated in test mode, where the algorithm demonstrated an accuracy of 97.24%, a sensitivity of 94.29%, and a specificity of 100%. To further validate the algorithm, it was challenged to classify blinded objects in the test set, which was independent of the training set. The algorithm correctly classified 93.85% of the total testing samples, with a sensitivity of 91.43%, a specificity of 96.67%, and a positive predictive value of 96.97%. This multi-step evaluation process, including cross-validation and blind testing, ensured the robustness and reliability of the classification algorithm.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In the evaluation of our classification algorithm, several key performance metrics were reported to assess its effectiveness in distinguishing between node-positive and node-negative colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. For the training set, the algorithm achieved a perfect accuracy of 100.00% in learning mode, correctly classifying all 145 samples. In test mode, the algorithm demonstrated high performance with an accuracy of 97.24%, a sensitivity of 94.29%, and a specificity of 100.00%. These metrics indicate the algorithm's ability to correctly identify both node-positive and node-negative cases with high reliability.\n\nFor the test set, the algorithm's performance was further validated on blinded samples, achieving an overall accuracy of 93.85%. The sensitivity was 91.43%, and the specificity was 96.67%. Additionally, the positive predictive value was 96.97%, indicating a high probability that patients predicted to be node-positive were indeed node-positive. These metrics collectively demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the classification algorithm.\n\nThe reported metrics are representative of standard performance measures used in similar studies, ensuring that our results can be compared and validated against existing literature. The high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity values suggest that our approach is effective and reliable for the intended application.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "Not applicable. The publication focuses on the development and evaluation of a classification algorithm using SELDI-TOF-MS for differentiating between node-positive and node-negative colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. It does not mention any comparison to publicly available methods or simpler baselines on benchmark datasets. The evaluation primarily involves the performance of the classification tree on training and test sets, including metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The study emphasizes the reproducibility and quality control of the SELDI protein chip assay but does not discuss comparisons with other methods or baselines.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the classification algorithm's performance was conducted using both training and test sets. For the training set, the algorithm achieved perfect accuracy of 100.00% (145 of 145 samples). In the test mode, the algorithm demonstrated an accuracy of 97.24% (141 of 145), with a sensitivity of 94.29% (66 of 70) and specificity of 100.00% (75 of 75). These metrics indicate a high level of confidence in the algorithm's ability to correctly classify samples.\n\nThe validity of the classification algorithm was further verified by challenging it to classify blinded objects in the test set. The algorithm correctly classified 93.85% (61 of 65) of the total testing samples, with a sensitivity of 91.43% (32 of 35) and a specificity of 96.67% (29 of 30). The positive predictive value was 96.97% (32 of 33), reinforcing the reliability of the results.\n\nStatistical significance was assessed using the Student t-test for comparing relative peak intensity levels between groups, with a threshold of P< 10^-4 considered statistically significant. For comparing rates between groups, the \u03c72 test was used, with P< 0.05 regarded as a significant difference. These statistical measures ensure that the observed differences are not due to random chance, providing a robust basis for claiming the superiority of the method.\n\nThe reproducibility of the SELDI protein chip assay spectra was evaluated using a single healthy volunteer serum sample. The intra- and interassay coefficients of variance (CVs) for mass were both 0.03%, indicating high precision. The intra- and interassay CVs for normalized intensity were 17.20% and 19.48%, respectively, showing consistent performance across different assays and chips. Little variation was found with day-to-day sampling and instrumentation or chip variations, further supporting the reliability of the results.",
