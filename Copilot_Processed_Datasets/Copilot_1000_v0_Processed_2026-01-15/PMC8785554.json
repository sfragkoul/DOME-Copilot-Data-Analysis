  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from the Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center. A total of 103 colorectal cancer patients with metastases limited to the lung were identified for this research. These patients underwent radical lung resection, and their clinical and histopathological characteristics were thoroughly documented. The dataset includes detailed information on the patients' overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), which were crucial for developing and validating the combined nomogram model. The data points encompass various features extracted from whole slide histopathological images, radiomics analyses, and immunoscore calculations. This comprehensive dataset has not been previously used in other published studies, making it unique to this research. The focus on lung metastases specifically sets it apart from other datasets that may have included different metastatic sites. The dataset's specificity to lung metastases and the integration of multiple data types provide a robust foundation for predicting postoperative outcomes in colorectal cancer patients with lung metastasis.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our study leverages machine learning techniques to enhance the predictive power of our nomogram model. Specifically, we utilized a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the analysis of whole slide histopathological images in a weakly supervised manner. This approach is part of the broader field of deep learning, which has shown significant promise in medical imaging and pathology.\n\nThe CNN used in our study is not a novel algorithm but rather an established method within the machine learning community. CNNs are widely recognized for their ability to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images, making them highly effective for tasks involving image data. The choice of CNN was driven by its proven track record in medical imaging applications, where it has demonstrated superior performance in feature extraction and pattern recognition.\n\nGiven that the CNN is a well-established algorithm, it was not necessary to publish the details of the algorithm itself in a machine learning journal. Instead, our focus was on applying this established technique to a specific medical problem\u2014predicting the postoperative outcomes of colorectal cancer patients with lung metastasis. The innovation lies in the integration of CNNs with other predictive features, such as radiomics and Immunoscore, to create a comprehensive and accurate predictive model. This interdisciplinary approach allows us to leverage the strengths of machine learning in a clinical context, ultimately aiming to improve patient outcomes through more precise and personalized medical predictions.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model developed in this study is indeed a meta-predictor, integrating multiple machine learning methods to enhance predictive accuracy. The combined nomogram model incorporates several key components:\n\nFirstly, pathomics features are derived using a patch-level convolutional neural network trained in a weakly supervised manner on whole slide histopathological images. This approach allows for the extraction of meaningful patterns from histopathological data that correlate with patient outcomes.\n\nSecondly, radiomics features are identified using a synthetic minority oversampling technique and a support vector machine classifier. These features are selected based on their ability to predict overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in colorectal cancer patients with lung metastasis.\n\nAdditionally, the Immunoscore is calculated for each patient based on the density of CD3+ and CD8+ cells at the invasive margin and the center of the metastatic tumor. This immunological data provides crucial information about the tumor microenvironment and its impact on patient prognosis.\n\nThe combined nomogram model integrates these pathomics, radiomics, and Immunoscore features along with clinical factors such as sex and tumor site. This integration allows for a comprehensive prediction of OS and DFS, leveraging the strengths of each individual component.\n\nRegarding the independence of training data, the study ensures that the data used for developing the pathomics, radiomics, and Immunoscore signatures are independent. This independence is crucial for the validity of the meta-predictor, as it prevents overfitting and ensures that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data. The calibration curve and decision curve analysis further confirm the clinical usefulness and high performance of the combined nomogram model.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the machine-learning algorithm, data encoding and preprocessing involved several key steps. Histopathological images were analyzed using a patch-level convolutional neural network trained in a weakly supervised manner. This approach allowed for the extraction of meaningful features from whole slide images, which were then used for survival analysis.\n\nRadiomics features were identified using the synthetic minority oversampling technique and a support vector machine classifier. This process ensured that the radiomics signature was robust and capable of predicting patient outcomes accurately.\n\nThe Immunoscore for each patient was calculated based on the density of CD3+ and CD8+ cells at the invasive margin and the center of the metastatic tumor. These cells were assessed on consecutive sections of automated digital pathology, providing a quantitative measure of the immune response within the tumor microenvironment.\n\nThese encoded features\u2014pathomics, radiomics, and Immunoscore\u2014were integrated with clinical factors to develop predictive signatures for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). The combined nomogram model demonstrated high performance in predicting these outcomes, with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.860 for OS and 0.875 for DFS. This indicates that the encoded data effectively captured the relevant information needed for accurate prognosis.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the combined nomogram model integrates multiple parameters to predict the postoperative outcomes of colorectal cancer patients with lung metastasis. Specifically, the model incorporates clinical factors, pathomics signatures, radiomics signatures, and Immunoscore.\n\nThe pathomics signature was developed using a patch-level convolutional neural network trained in a weakly supervised manner on whole slide histopathological images. Five whole slide features were selected for constructing the pathomics-based prognosis model.\n\nFor the radiomics signature, synthetic minority oversampling technique and support vector machine classifier were employed. Eight features were identified and used to develop the radiomics signatures. These features were selected through a detailed procedure described in the supplementary methods.\n\nThe Immunoscore was calculated based on the density of CD3+ and CD8+ cells at the invasive margin and the center of the metastatic tumor, assessed on consecutive sections of automated digital pathology.\n\nThe selection of these parameters was driven by their independent prognostic value for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). The combined nomogram model demonstrated high performance with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.860 for OS prediction and 0.875 for DFS prediction. The calibration and decision curve analyses further confirmed the clinical usefulness of the combined nomogram.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized a combination of features from different domains to build our predictive models. For the pathomics signature, five whole slide features were selected and used as input. These features were identified using a weakly supervised convolutional neural network trained on histopathological images.\n\nFor the radiomics signature, we employed a synthetic minority oversampling technique and a support vector machine classifier to identify and select eight features. These features were chosen based on their ability to distinguish between different risk subtypes for both overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS).\n\nFeature selection was performed using the training set only, ensuring that the selected features were not influenced by the test set, thus maintaining the integrity of our model's validation process. This approach helped us to develop robust predictive signatures for OS and DFS in colorectal cancer patients with lung metastasis.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study involved the integration of deep learning-based pathomics, radiomics, and immunoscore to predict postoperative outcomes for colorectal cancer patients with lung metastasis. The model utilized a patch-level convolutional neural network trained in a weakly supervised manner for whole slide histopathological images survival analysis. This approach allowed for the extraction of meaningful features from a large number of training points, mitigating the risk of overfitting.\n\nTo further ensure the robustness of the model, synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was used to address class imbalances, and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was employed to identify radiomics features and build predictive signatures. The immunoscore for each patient was calculated from the density of CD3+ and CD8+ cells, providing an additional layer of prognostic information.\n\nThe combined nomogram model was validated through survival ROC analysis, which demonstrated high area under the curve (AUC) values for predicting overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Additionally, calibration curves and decision curve analysis were performed to illustrate the clinical decision utility of the combined nomogram, confirming its high accuracy and clinical usefulness.\n\nIn summary, the fitting method involved a comprehensive approach that leveraged multiple data sources and advanced machine learning techniques to develop a robust and reliable predictive model. The use of SMOTE and SVM, along with rigorous validation methods, ensured that the model was neither overfitted nor underfitted, providing reliable predictions for clinical outcomes.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our models. One key method used was the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). This technique helps to balance the dataset by generating synthetic samples for the minority class, which is crucial in medical imaging where certain outcomes might be underrepresented. By addressing class imbalance, SMOTE aids in creating a more generalizable model that is less likely to overfit to the majority class.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized support vector machine (SVM) classifiers, which inherently include regularization parameters that help in preventing overfitting. The SVM classifier with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel was chosen for its ability to handle high-dimensional data and its effectiveness in feature selection, which is particularly important in radiomics where the feature space can be vast.\n\nFurthermore, the convolutional neural network (CNN) used for whole slide histopathological images was trained in a weakly supervised manner. This approach reduces the risk of overfitting by focusing on learning from broader patterns rather than specific, potentially noisy, details in the images. The weakly supervised learning framework ensures that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data.\n\nIn summary, our study incorporated SMOTE for data balancing, SVM classifiers for feature selection and regularization, and weakly supervised learning for CNN training to mitigate overfitting and enhance the predictive performance of our models.",

  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in this study is not entirely a black box, as it integrates several interpretable components. The combined nomogram model incorporates clinical features, pathomics, radiomics signatures, and Immunoscore, each of which contributes to the overall prediction of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with lung metastasis.\n\nThe pathomics component involves the use of deep learning techniques on whole slide histopathological images. This process is somewhat interpretable because it involves identifying specific patterns and features within the images that are associated with patient outcomes. The synthetic minority oversampling technique and support vector machine classifier used in the radiomics component help identify specific imaging features that are predictive of OS and DFS. These features can be visualized and analyzed, providing insights into which aspects of the images are most informative.\n\nThe Immunoscore, calculated from the density of CD3+ and CD8+ cells at the invasive margin and the center of the metastatic tumor, is a more straightforward and interpretable component. The density of these immune cells is directly linked to the patient's immune response and has been shown to be an independent prognostic factor.\n\nThe combined nomogram itself is a visual tool that integrates these various components into a single predictive model. While the exact weights and interactions between the different features may not be immediately apparent, the nomogram provides a clear and interpretable way to estimate the likelihood of OS and DFS for individual patients. This makes it a useful tool for clinicians, as it allows them to understand the relative importance of different factors in predicting patient outcomes.\n\nIn summary, while the model does involve complex machine learning techniques, it is not entirely a black box. The use of interpretable components such as pathomics, radiomics, and Immunoscore, along with the visual nature of the nomogram, provides a level of transparency that can be valuable for clinical decision-making.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is primarily a regression model, as it predicts continuous outcomes related to survival probabilities. Specifically, it predicts overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) for colorectal cancer patients with lung metastasis. The model integrates various features, including clinical factors, pathomics, radiomics signatures, and Immunoscore, to generate predictive nomograms. These nomograms provide a probability score for OS and DFS, which are continuous outcomes rather than discrete classes. The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as the area under the curve (AUC) for survival ROC analysis, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis, all of which are typical for regression models focused on survival prediction.",

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the combined nomogram model involved several key steps to ensure its robustness and clinical utility. The model's performance was assessed using survival ROC analysis, which demonstrated high area under the curve (AUC) values for predicting overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Specifically, the AUC for OS prediction was 0.860, and for DFS prediction, it was 0.875. These values indicate the model's strong prognostic accuracy.\n\nAdditionally, calibration curves were used to evaluate the model's predictive accuracy. The calibration curves for both OS and DFS showed high accuracy, confirming that the predicted probabilities closely matched the actual outcomes.\n\nDecision curve analysis (DCA) was also performed to illustrate the clinical decision utility of the combined nomogram. The DCA results showed that the combined model provided a higher net benefit compared to using the pathomics signature, radiomics signature, or Immunoscore alone. This suggests that the combined nomogram is more effective in guiding clinical decisions.\n\nFurthermore, Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to depict OS and DFS according to pathomics and radiomics subtypes. Significant differences in survival were observed between patients with high and low pathomics and radiomics scores, further validating the model's prognostic value.\n\nThe study included a total of 103 colorectal cancer patients with lung metastases who underwent radical lung resection. The clinical and histopathological characteristics of these patients were carefully considered in the evaluation process.\n\nIn summary, the combined nomogram model was evaluated using a comprehensive approach that included survival ROC analysis, calibration curves, decision curve analysis, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. The results demonstrated the model's high prognostic accuracy and clinical utility, making it a valuable tool for predicting OS and DFS in colorectal cancer patients with lung metastases.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed several performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of our combined nomogram model in predicting overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) for colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with lung metastasis.\n\nWe primarily reported the area under the curve (AUC) from the survival receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The AUC values for our combined nomogram model were 0.860 for OS prediction and 0.875 for DFS prediction. These values indicate high performance and suggest that our model is robust in predicting both OS and DFS.\n\nAdditionally, we used calibration curves to assess the accuracy of our combined nomogram model. The calibration curves for both OS and DFS predictions showed high accuracy, further validating the reliability of our model.\n\nTo demonstrate the clinical utility of our combined nomogram, we performed a decision curve analysis. This analysis showed that our combined model provided a higher net benefit compared to using the pathomics signature, radiomics signature, and immunoscore alone. This suggests that our combined nomogram is not only statistically robust but also clinically useful.\n\nThese performance metrics are representative of current standards in the literature for evaluating prognostic models in oncology. The use of AUC, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis provides a comprehensive evaluation of our model's predictive accuracy, reliability, and clinical utility.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the combined nomogram model demonstrates high confidence in its performance metrics. The area under the curve (AUC) values for predicting overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) are provided with confidence intervals, indicating the reliability of these metrics. Specifically, the AUC for OS prediction is 0.860 with a confidence interval of 0.730 to 0.973, and for DFS prediction, it is 0.875 with a confidence interval of 0.764 to 0.986. These intervals suggest a robust performance of the model.\n\nStatistical significance is also addressed in the evaluation. The decision curve analysis shows that the combined nomogram model outperforms individual components such as the radiomics signature, immunoscore, and pathomics signature alone. This is evident from the higher net benefit observed across various threshold probabilities. Additionally, the calibration curves for OS and DFS predictions further validate the model's accuracy, showing a close alignment between predicted and actual outcomes.\n\nThe survival ROC curves and decision curve analyses provide visual evidence of the model's superior performance. The significant differences in survival observed between high and low risk groups, as indicated by the Kaplan-Meier survival curves, reinforce the model's prognostic accuracy. Overall, the evaluation metrics and statistical analyses collectively support the claim that the combined nomogram model is superior to individual predictive factors, offering a reliable tool for predicting postoperative outcomes in colorectal cancer patients with lung metastasis.",
