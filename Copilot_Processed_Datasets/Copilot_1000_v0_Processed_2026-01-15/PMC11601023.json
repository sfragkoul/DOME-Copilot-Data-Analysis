  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset for this study was sourced from the Indiana University Health Cerner Enterprise Data Warehouse. This comprehensive data repository provided the necessary information for our analysis. The total study population consisted of 2828 encounters of hospitalized children diagnosed with asthma. However, only 683 individual encounters had laboratory tests obtained within the first 12 hours of hospitalization and were thus included in the clustering analysis. The dataset included a variety of data types, such as patient demographics, diagnostic data, vital signs obtained at hourly intervals, respiratory data, the Pediatric Asthma Severity Score (PASS), laboratory data, and medication data. This rich dataset allowed for a detailed examination of different aspects of pediatric asthma, enabling the identification of distinct clinical phenotypes through unsupervised machine learning methods. The data was pre-processed to transform categorical data into a binary format using one-hot encoding, and missing laboratory data was imputed with normal values. The temperature data was transformed into a binary variable indicating the presence or absence of fever, using 38.0\u00b0C as the cutoff. The dataset was split into an 80% derivation cohort and a 20% validation cohort based on the total hospital length of stay. This approach ensured that the findings could be validated on a separate subset of the data, enhancing the robustness of the results. The dataset used in this study has not been used in previous papers by the community.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into two primary splits: a derivation cohort and a validation cohort. The derivation cohort consisted of 547 encounters, which accounted for 80% of the total study population. The validation cohort comprised 136 encounters, making up the remaining 20%. The total study population included 683 encounters of hospitalized children diagnosed with asthma, all of whom had laboratory tests obtained within the first 12 hours of hospitalization. The distribution of data points in each split was maintained to ensure that the characteristics of the derivation and validation cohorts were similar, with no significant differences observed in any of the variables between the two cohorts. This split was used to train and validate the clustering algorithm and the logistic regression model, ensuring that the findings were reproducible and generalizable.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset used in this study was obtained from the Indiana University Health Cerner Enterprise Data Warehouse. The total study population consisted of 2828 encounters of hospitalized children with a diagnosis of asthma. Out of these, 683 individual encounters had laboratory tests obtained in the first 12 hours of hospitalization and were included in the clustering analysis.\n\nThe full cohort was split into an 80% derivation cohort and a 20% validation cohort using total hospital length of stay (LOS) as a sample partition. This split ensured that the training and test sets were independent. The derivation cohort contained 547 encounters, while the validation cohort consisted of 136 encounters.\n\nThe derivation cohort had a median age of 7 years, with 43.7% of the patients being of Black race, 55.9% being male, and 61.4% including PICU admission. The median hospital length of stay was 3.3 days. The validation cohort had similar characteristics, with a median age of 6 years, 39.0% of the patients being of Black race, 61.0% being male, and 66.2% including PICU admission. The median hospital length of stay was also 3.3 days.\n\nThere were no significant differences in any of the variables between the derivation and validation cohorts, indicating that the split was effective in maintaining similar distributions. This approach ensures that the findings from the derivation cohort can be validated independently in the validation cohort, providing robust results.\n\nThe distribution of the dataset compares favorably to previously published machine learning datasets in terms of maintaining independence between training and test sets. The use of a clear partitioning method based on total hospital length of stay ensures that the datasets are independent and that the validation cohort can serve as a true test of the model's generalizability.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data used in this study was obtained from the Indiana University Health Cerner Enterprise Data Warehouse. The dataset included patient demographics, diagnostic data, vital signs, respiratory data, the Pediatric Asthma Severity Score, laboratory data, and medication data. The data was split into an 80% derivation cohort and a 20% validation cohort using total hospital length of stay as a sample partition.\n\nThe data is not publicly available. The study was conducted in accordance with ethical guidelines and regulations, ensuring the privacy and confidentiality of patient information. The data was used under the appropriate institutional review board approvals and data use agreements, which enforced the secure handling and analysis of the data. The specific details of the data splits and the methods used for data preprocessing and analysis are described in the study, but the raw data itself is not released in a public forum.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in this study is unsupervised learning, specifically consensus k-means clustering. This method was employed to identify distinct clinical phenotypes in severe acute pediatric asthma using data readily available in the electronic health record within the first 12 hours of hospital admission.\n\nThe k-means clustering algorithm is not new; it is a well-established technique in the field of machine learning. It was chosen for its ability to partition data into clusters based on feature similarity, making it suitable for identifying patterns in the dataset.\n\nThe decision to use k-means clustering in this context was driven by the need to derive meaningful clinical phenotypes from the data, rather than to introduce a novel machine-learning algorithm. The focus of the study was on applying established methods to a specific medical problem, aiming to improve clinical outcomes for pediatric asthma patients. Therefore, the algorithm's application and results were published in a pediatric pulmonology journal, aligning with the study's clinical and medical research objectives.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employed in this study does not function as a meta-predictor. Instead, it utilizes an unsupervised machine learning method, specifically consensus k-means clustering, to identify distinct phenotypes of severe acute pediatric asthma. This clustering algorithm was applied to a derivation cohort using encounter-level data, including demographics, diagnostic information, vital signs, respiratory data, laboratory results, and medication data.\n\nThe logistic regression model, which was subsequently developed, used the same input variables as the clustering algorithm. These variables were derived from patient-centric data obtained within the first 12 hours of hospitalization. The model was trained on the derivation cohort and then applied to a separate validation cohort to classify patients into the identified phenotypes.\n\nThe independence of the training data is ensured by splitting the full cohort into an 80% derivation cohort and a 20% validation cohort using total hospital length of stay as the sample partition. This approach helps to maintain the independence of the data used for training and validation, ensuring that the model's performance can be reliably assessed.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the machine-learning algorithm, data pre-processing involved transforming categorical data into a binary format using one-hot encoding. This method ensures that categorical variables are converted into a format that can be provided to machine learning algorithms to improve predictions. Patient race was included as a binary variable, specifically distinguishing between Black and non-Black, due to its potential influence on clinical outcomes in asthma. This decision was based on the possibility that genetic, social, and environmental factors might result in different phenotypes of pediatric severe acute asthma among Black patients, which could be identified through machine learning methods. Missing laboratory data were imputed with normal values, and temperature was transformed into a binary variable indicating the presence or absence of fever, using 38.0\u00b0C as the cutoff. This preprocessing ensured that the data was in a suitable format for the unsupervised clustering algorithm, which was consensus k-means clustering. The algorithm used encounter-level demographics, diagnostic data, vital signs obtained on admission and at 12 hours after admission, initial and 12-hour Pediatric Asthma Severity Score (PASS) values, and laboratory data obtained within the first 12 hours of hospitalization.",
  "optimization/parameters": "The model utilized a variety of input parameters to identify distinct phenotypes in severe acute pediatric asthma. The selection of these parameters was guided by the availability of data within the first 12 hours of hospitalization. Specifically, the parameters included patient demographics, diagnostic data, vital signs obtained at admission and 12 hours later, the Pediatric Asthma Severity Score (PASS) at initial and 12-hour intervals, and laboratory data collected within the first 12 hours.\n\nThe exact number of parameters (p) used in the model can be inferred from the variables listed in the logistic regression coefficients table. These variables encompass a range of clinical and demographic factors, such as age, race, ethnicity, sex, presence of pneumonia, complex chronic conditions, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, fever, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, fraction of inspired oxygen, PASS, blood pressure, and various laboratory markers including white blood cell count, neutrophil percentage, lymphocyte percentage, eosinophil percentage, and hemoglobin levels.\n\nThe selection of these parameters was based on their clinical relevance and the goal of capturing the most informative features for phenotype identification. The consensus k-means clustering algorithm was applied using these parameters, and the optimal number of clusters was determined through methods such as the elbow method and an in-depth evaluation of clinical features. This process ensured that the selected parameters were both relevant and effective in distinguishing between different phenotypes of severe acute pediatric asthma.",
  "optimization/features": "The study utilized a comprehensive set of input features for the unsupervised machine learning algorithm. The features included patient demographics, diagnostic data, vital signs obtained longitudinally at hourly intervals, respiratory data including device and fraction of inspired oxygen, the Pediatric Asthma Severity Score (PASS), laboratory data, and medication data. Specifically, the vital signs and PASS values were recorded both on admission and at 12 hours post-admission. Laboratory data were also considered within the first 12 hours of hospitalization.\n\nThe total number of features (f) used as input is not explicitly stated, but it encompasses a wide range of variables. These variables were transformed and pre-processed as necessary, such as converting categorical data into binary format using one-hot encoding. Missing laboratory data were imputed with normal values, and temperature was transformed into a binary variable indicating the presence or absence of fever.\n\nFeature selection was not explicitly mentioned as a separate step in the methodology. Instead, the study relied on the consensus k-means clustering algorithm to identify the most relevant features for distinguishing between the phenotypes. The clustering was performed using encounter-level demographics, diagnostic data, vital signs, PASS values, and laboratory data obtained within the first 12 hours of hospitalization. The selection of the optimal number of clusters was done using both the elbow method and an in-depth evaluation of the clinical features seen in varying numbers of clusters.\n\nThe logistic regression model, which was trained on the derivation cohort and applied to the validation cohort, used the same input variables as the clustering algorithm. This approach ensured that the model was trained and validated on the same set of features, maintaining consistency across the analysis.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The study employed a logistic regression model to predict cluster assignment based on input variables used in the clustering algorithm. The model was trained on a derivation cohort, which constituted 80% of the full cohort, and then applied to a validation cohort, making up the remaining 20%. This split ensured that the model's performance could be evaluated on unseen data, helping to mitigate overfitting.\n\nThe number of parameters in the logistic regression model was not excessively large compared to the number of training points. The model included variables such as age, race, ethnicity, sex, presence of pneumonia, complex chronic conditions, and various vital signs and laboratory markers. These variables were selected based on their clinical relevance and availability within the first 12 hours of hospitalization.\n\nTo rule out overfitting, the model's performance was validated on a separate cohort that was not used during the training phase. The consistency of the encounter ratio and several clinical characteristics between the derivation and validation cohorts indicated that the model generalized well to new data. Additionally, the use of a logistic regression model, which is relatively simple and less prone to overfitting compared to more complex models, further supported the robustness of the findings.\n\nUnderfitting was addressed by ensuring that the model included a comprehensive set of clinically relevant variables. The selection of variables was based on both statistical significance and clinical relevance, ensuring that the model captured the essential aspects of the data. The successful reproduction of phenotypes in the validation cohort, along with the maintenance of key clinical characteristics, suggested that the model was appropriately complex to capture the underlying patterns in the data without being overly simplistic.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed logistic regression to predict cluster assignment based on various input variables. To prevent overfitting, we utilized a validation cohort distinct from the derivation cohort. The derivation cohort, comprising 80% of the full cohort, was used to train the logistic regression model. This model was then applied to the validation cohort, which consisted of the remaining 20% of the data. This approach helped ensure that the model's performance was evaluated on unseen data, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting.\n\nAdditionally, the selection of the optimal number of clusters was carefully determined using both the elbow method and an in-depth evaluation of the clinical features seen in varying numbers of clusters. This methodical approach to clustering helped in identifying the most relevant phenotypes without overfitting to the derivation cohort's specific characteristics.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization schedule used in this study are not explicitly detailed in the provided information. The study focuses on the application of consensus k-means clustering and logistic regression for identifying distinct clinical phenotypes in severe acute pediatric asthma. While the methods and results of these analyses are thoroughly described, specific details about the hyper-parameter configurations and optimization schedule are not reported.\n\nThe model files and optimization parameters are also not made available. The study does not mention the provision of any model files or optimization parameters for public access or reuse. Therefore, it is not possible to provide information on where these might be accessed or under what license they would be available.\n\nIn summary, the hyper-parameter configurations, optimization schedule, model files, and optimization parameters are not reported or made available in this study.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a black box. We utilized a consensus k-means clustering algorithm, which is an unsupervised learning method, to identify distinct phenotypes of severe acute pediatric asthma. This approach is transparent and interpretable, as it groups patients based on their similarities in clinical and laboratory features.\n\nThe clustering algorithm used encounter-level data, including demographics, diagnostic data, vital signs, respiratory data, the Pediatric Asthma Severity Score (PASS), and laboratory data. By transforming categorical data into binary format using one-hot encoding, we ensured that the model could effectively process and interpret these variables.\n\nAfter deriving the clusters, we created a logistic regression model to predict cluster assignment based on the same input variables used in the clustering algorithm. This logistic regression model is inherently interpretable, as it provides odds ratios for each variable, indicating their association with cluster assignment. For instance, variables such as age, race, ethnicity, and specific laboratory markers like eosinophil percentage have clear and quantifiable impacts on the likelihood of a patient being assigned to a particular cluster.\n\nThe logistic regression coefficients, as shown in Table 3, offer a straightforward interpretation of how each variable influences the probability of belonging to a specific cluster. For example, the odds ratio for age is 2.43, meaning that older age is associated with a higher likelihood of being in Cluster 2. Similarly, the odds ratio for Black race is 3.22, indicating that patients identifying as Black are more likely to be in Cluster 2.\n\nFurthermore, the predicted cluster characteristics in Table 4 provide a detailed comparison of the clinical features between the two clusters. This table includes median values and interquartile ranges for various clinical variables, allowing for a clear understanding of the differences between the clusters. For example, Cluster 2 patients tend to have a higher percentage of lymphocytes and eosinophils, and a lower magnitude of improvement in vital signs 12 hours from hospital admission.\n\nIn summary, the model's transparency is evident through the use of interpretable machine learning techniques and the provision of clear, quantifiable results. This transparency enables clinicians to understand the underlying factors contributing to the identified phenotypes, facilitating more targeted and effective treatment strategies.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a classification model. Specifically, it is a logistic regression model designed to predict cluster assignment for patients with severe acute pediatric asthma. The model was trained on a derivation cohort and then applied to a validation cohort to classify patients into two distinct phenotypes based on data obtained within the first 12 hours of hospitalization. The model's output is the classification of patients into one of two clusters, each with unique clinical characteristics and outcomes. The logistic regression coefficients provided in the study indicate the odds ratios for various clinical factors, such as age, race, ethnicity, and laboratory markers, in predicting cluster assignment. This classification approach allows for the identification of patients who may require different management strategies based on their phenotype.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method involved a rigorous process to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the findings. The study utilized an unsupervised machine learning approach, specifically consensus k-means clustering, to identify distinct phenotypes of severe acute pediatric asthma. The full cohort was divided into an 80% derivation cohort and a 20% validation cohort based on total hospital length of stay. The k-means clustering algorithm was applied to the derivation cohort, using encounter-level data such as demographics, diagnostic information, vital signs, the Pediatric Asthma Severity Score (PASS), and laboratory data obtained within the first 12 hours of hospitalization. The optimal number of clusters was determined using the elbow method and an in-depth evaluation of clinical features.\n\nFollowing the derivation of clusters, a logistic regression model was developed to predict cluster assignment based on the same input variables used in the clustering algorithm. This model was trained on the derivation cohort and then applied to the validation cohort. The predicted cluster characteristics were compared between the derivation and validation cohorts, as well as to the original clusters, to assess the consistency and reliability of the identified phenotypes. The validation cohort maintained the overall encounter ratio of approximately 2:1 between the clusters, along with several key clinical characteristics such as age, vital sign responsiveness, and laboratory markers. However, differences in length of stay and the use of invasive mechanical ventilation were not observed in the validation cohort. This evaluation method ensured that the identified phenotypes were reproducible and clinically relevant.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we focused on evaluating the performance of our clustering algorithm and logistic regression model using several key metrics. For the clustering algorithm, we primarily used the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters. This method involves plotting the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) against the number of clusters and identifying the \"elbow\" point where the rate of decrease sharply slows. This approach is widely accepted in the literature for determining the optimal number of clusters in k-means clustering.\n\nFor the logistic regression model, we assessed its performance by applying it to a separate validation cohort. We compared the predicted cluster characteristics between the derivation and validation cohorts. The model's ability to classify patients into the two identified phenotypes was evaluated by maintaining the overall encounter ratio of approximately 2:1 between the clusters. We also examined several clinical characteristics, such as age, vital sign responsiveness, and laboratory markers, to ensure consistency between the derivation and validation cohorts.\n\nAdditionally, we reported odds ratios (OR) for various variables in the logistic regression model. These ORs indicate the likelihood of a patient being assigned to Cluster 2 based on specific characteristics, such as age, race, sex, and laboratory values. This detailed reporting of ORs provides insights into the factors that significantly influence cluster assignment, which is crucial for understanding the distinct phenotypes identified.\n\nWhile we did not report traditional performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) for the logistic regression model, the consistency in clinical characteristics and the maintenance of the encounter ratio between the derivation and validation cohorts serve as strong indicators of the model's performance. These metrics are representative of the literature, focusing on the reproducibility and generalizability of the identified phenotypes rather than purely statistical measures.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "Not applicable. The study focused on identifying phenotypes of severe acute pediatric asthma using unsupervised machine learning methods, specifically consensus k-means clustering. The evaluation of the derived clusters was primarily conducted through internal validation using a separate validation cohort. The study did not involve a comparison to publicly available methods or simpler baselines on benchmark datasets. Instead, the validation process involved applying a logistic regression model trained on the derivation cohort to the validation cohort to assess the reproducibility of the identified phenotypes. The comparison was made between the characteristics of the clusters in the derivation and validation cohorts, focusing on clinical factors such as age, vital sign responsiveness, and laboratory markers. The study aimed to demonstrate the consistency and clinical relevance of the identified phenotypes rather than comparing them to existing methods or baselines.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our study's performance metrics included statistical significance testing to ensure the robustness of our findings. We used various statistical tests to compare categorical and continuous variables. For categorical variables, we employed Chi-square tests or Fisher's exact tests, depending on the category sizes. Continuous variables were compared using Mann-Whitney U tests. These tests helped us determine whether the differences observed between clusters were statistically significant.\n\nThe results indicated that several variables showed significant differences between the clusters. For instance, age, heart rate, respiratory rate, and laboratory values such as neutrophil, lymphocyte, and eosinophil percentages were significantly different between the clusters. These findings suggest that the identified phenotypes are distinct and that the clustering method effectively captured meaningful differences in the data.\n\nThe logistic regression model used to predict cluster assignment also provided odds ratios for various variables, indicating their relative importance in determining cluster membership. Variables such as age, male sex, and eosinophil percentage had notable odds ratios, further supporting the significance of the identified phenotypes.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that some variables did not show significant differences, particularly in the validation cohort. This could be due to the smaller sample size in the validation cohort, which might limit the statistical power to detect significant differences. Despite this, the overall consistency in the cluster characteristics between the derivation and validation cohorts suggests that the phenotypes are generalizable.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics and statistical significance tests provide confidence in the robustness of our findings. The identified phenotypes show distinct clinical characteristics, and the logistic regression model effectively predicts cluster assignment based on early hospitalization data. This supports the potential for precision medicine approaches in managing severe acute pediatric asthma.",
  "evaluation/availability": "The raw evaluation files used in this study are not publicly available due to the inclusion of protected health information. However, a deidentified version of the dataset is accessible upon request from the corresponding author. This approach ensures that the data can be used for further research while maintaining the privacy and security of the individuals involved. The decision to restrict public access to the raw data is in line with ethical guidelines and regulations governing the use of health information."
