  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study is sourced from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The TCGA cohort consists of 80 samples, while the validation cohorts include GSE22138 with 63 samples, GSE27831 with 29 samples, GSE84976 with 28 samples, and GSE39717 with 30 samples. These datasets have been utilized in previous research and by the community for studying uveal melanoma (UM). The data from TCGA underwent transformation of Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million (FPKM) values to Transcripts Per Kilobase Million (TPM) values. For the microarray data in the GEO cohorts, background adjustments and quantile normalization were performed using the robust multiarray averaging (RAM) method with specific R packages. The TPM and RAM expression values from each cohort were then used for subsequent data analysis.",
  "dataset/splits": "In our study, we utilized multiple datasets to ensure the robustness of our findings. The primary dataset used for training was the TCGA cohort, which consisted of 80 samples. For validation purposes, we employed four additional cohorts: GSE22138 with 63 samples, GSE27831 with 29 samples, GSE84976 with 28 samples, and GSE39717 with 30 samples. These cohorts were selected to provide a comprehensive validation of our prognostic signature across different patient populations.\n\nThe distribution of data points in each cohort varied, reflecting the diversity in sample sizes and clinical characteristics. The TCGA cohort had an equal distribution of patients aged \u226460 and >60, with 40 patients in each age group. Gender distribution showed a slight majority of male patients (56.25%) compared to female patients (43.75%). The M stage, N stage, and T stage information was also recorded, with most patients being classified as M stage No (91.25%), N stage No (95.00%), and T stage T3 (45.00%) or T4 (47.50%).\n\nIn the validation cohorts, the distribution of age and gender varied. For instance, GSE22138 had a slightly higher proportion of patients aged >60 (55.56%) and a higher percentage of male patients (61.90%). The M stage distribution also differed, with a higher proportion of M stage Yes in GSE22138 (55.56%) compared to the TCGA cohort. The other cohorts, GSE27831, GSE84976, and GSE39717, had varying distributions of age, gender, and clinical stages, providing a broad spectrum of patient characteristics for validation.\n\nOverall, the use of multiple cohorts with diverse patient characteristics strengthened the generalizability of our prognostic signature, ensuring that it is applicable across different clinical settings and patient populations.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The study utilized multiple datasets to ensure robustness and generalizability of the findings. The primary dataset used for training was from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), comprising 80 samples. This dataset was used to develop and validate the prognostic model. Additionally, four validation cohorts were included: GSE22138 with 63 samples, GSE27831 with 29 samples, GSE84976 with 28 samples, and GSE39717 with 30 samples. These validation cohorts were sourced from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database.\n\nThe training and validation sets were independent, ensuring that the model's performance could be assessed on unseen data. This independence was enforced by using distinct patient cohorts for training and validation, thereby minimizing the risk of overfitting and ensuring that the model's prognostic capabilities were generalizable.\n\nThe distribution of key clinical and demographic variables, such as age, gender, and tumor characteristics, was compared across the training and validation cohorts. This comparison revealed that the datasets were representative of the broader uveal melanoma (UM) patient population, aligning with previously published datasets in terms of clinical features and outcomes. The inclusion of multiple independent cohorts strengthened the validity of the study's findings, demonstrating the model's robustness across different patient populations.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data utilized in this study is sourced from publicly available datasets, including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Specifically, the datasets used are TCGA, GSE22138, GSE27831, GSE84976, GSE39717, and GSE44295. These datasets are accessible to the public and can be retrieved from their respective repositories.\n\nThe TCGA dataset provides RNA-seq data, which was transformed from Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million (FPKM) values to Transcripts Per Kilobase Million (TPM) values. For the microarray data from the GEO datasets, background adjustments and quantile normalization were performed using the robust multiarray averaging (RAM) method with the R packages \u2018affy\u2019 and \u2018simpleaffy\u2019.\n\nThe data splits used in the study include a training cohort from TCGA and several validation cohorts from the GEO datasets. The training cohort consisted of 80 uveal melanoma (UM) patients, while the validation cohorts included GSE22138 (63 patients), GSE27831 (29 patients), GSE84976 (28 patients), GSE39717 (30 patients), and GSE44295 (57 patients).\n\nThe data is distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License 4.0 (CC BY), which allows for open access and reuse of the data with proper attribution. This licensing ensures that the data can be freely accessed, shared, and used by other researchers for further studies and validations.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm used in this study is not a traditional machine-learning algorithm but rather a combination of statistical methods tailored for survival analysis. Specifically, univariate and Lasso Cox regression models were employed. These are well-established techniques in the field of biostatistics and survival analysis, rather than novel machine-learning algorithms.\n\nThe univariate Cox regression model was initially used to screen for overall survival (OS)-related autophagy-related genes (ARGs) from a set of 423 ARGs. This step helped identify 133 ARGs that were significantly associated with the survival of uveal melanoma (UM) patients.\n\nFollowing this, a Lasso Cox regression model was applied to these 133 OS-related ARGs to develop a prognostic signature. The Lasso regression is a type of linear regression that includes a penalty term to enforce sparsity, effectively selecting a subset of the most relevant features (genes, in this case). This process resulted in a 9-ARG signature, which was then used to calculate risk scores for patients.\n\nThe choice of these statistical methods over traditional machine-learning algorithms is justified by their specific applicability to survival data. Cox regression models are designed to handle time-to-event data, making them suitable for analyzing survival times in medical research. The Lasso regression further aids in feature selection, which is crucial when dealing with high-dimensional genomic data.\n\nThe results of these analyses were validated across multiple independent cohorts, demonstrating the robustness and stability of the ARG-signature. The prognostic predictive value of the signature was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves, risk score distributions, and ROC curve analysis, all of which showed high accuracy in distinguishing between low- and high-risk UM patients.",
  "optimization/meta": "The prognostic prediction model developed for uveal melanoma (UM) patients is not a meta-predictor. It does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. Instead, it combines univariate Cox regression and Lasso Cox regression models to screen overall survival (OS)-related autophagy-related genes (ARGs) and develop a prognostic ARG-signature.\n\nThe model was developed using data from the TCGA cohort and validated in four external independent UM cohorts (GSE22138, GSE44295, GSE84976, and GSE27831). This validation process ensures that the training data is independent, as the model was not trained or tuned using the validation cohorts.\n\nThe ARG-signature is based on nine specific ARGs, and the coefficients of these genes were determined using Lasso Cox regression. The model's prognostic predictive ability was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves, survival distribution plots, and ROC curves, demonstrating its accuracy in predicting OS and disease-free survival (DFS) in multiple cohorts.",
  "optimization/encoding": "For the TCGA RNA-seq cohort, the data was initially encoded using Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million (FPKM) values, which were then transformed into Transcripts Per Kilobase Million (TPM) values. This transformation was based on algorithms from published research.\n\nFor the microarray data in the GSE22138, GSE27831, GSE44295, and GSE84976 cohorts, background adjustments and quantile normalization were performed using the robust multiarray averaging method (RAM). This process was carried out with the R packages \u2018affy\u2019 and \u2018simpleaffy\u2019.\n\nThe resulting TPM and RAM expression values from each cohort were then utilized in the subsequent data analysis. This preprocessing ensured that the data was standardized and suitable for the machine-learning algorithms employed in the study.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In the development of the prognostic signature, a total of nine parameters were used in the model. These parameters correspond to the expression values of nine specific autophagy-related genes (ARGs). The selection of these nine ARGs was performed through a two-step process involving univariate and Lasso Cox regression analyses.\n\nInitially, univariate Cox regression analysis was conducted on 423 ARGs to identify those associated with overall survival (OS) in uveal melanoma (UM) patients from the TCGA cohort. This analysis resulted in the identification of 133 OS-related ARGs, which included 39 protective genes and 94 risky genes.\n\nSubsequently, Lasso Cox regression was applied to these 133 OS-related ARGs to further refine the selection and develop a prognostic model. This process successfully established a prognostic signature based on the expression values of nine ARGs. The coefficients of these nine ARGs were determined and used to calculate a risk score for each patient, which was then used to stratify patients into low- and high-risk subgroups.",
  "optimization/features": "The input features used in the study are the expression values of 423 autophagy-related genes (ARGs). These genes were identified by taking the intersection of detected ARGs across multiple cohorts. Feature selection was performed using univariate Cox regression analysis on the training cohort (TCGA) to identify 133 OS-related ARGs. Further refinement using Lasso Cox regression analysis narrowed down these features to a 9-ARG signature. The feature selection process was conducted using the training set only, ensuring that the validation cohorts remained independent for assessing the model's performance.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The fitting method employed in this study involved the use of Lasso Cox regression analysis to construct a prognostic signature for uveal melanoma (UM) patients. The number of parameters, specifically the 423 autophagy-related genes (ARGs), was indeed much larger than the number of training points, which consisted of 80 UM patients from the TCGA cohort.\n\nTo address the potential issue of over-fitting, a Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression model was utilized. Lasso regression is particularly effective in high-dimensional data settings as it performs both variable selection and regularization, thereby reducing the complexity of the model and preventing over-fitting. This method shrinks the coefficients of less important features to zero, effectively selecting a subset of the most relevant ARGs.\n\nThe Lasso Cox regression analysis was applied to the 133 overall survival (OS)-related ARGs identified through univariate Cox regression. This process resulted in the development of a prognostic signature based on nine ARGs. The coefficients of these nine ARGs were calculated and used to develop a risk score formula. This formula was then used to calculate risk scores for each patient, dividing them into low- and high-risk subgroups based on the median risk score.\n\nTo ensure the robustness of the prognostic signature, several validation steps were performed. Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated that low-risk patients had a higher survival rate and longer survival time compared to high-risk patients. Additionally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed high area under the curve (AUC) values for predicting 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS, indicating strong predictive accuracy.\n\nFurthermore, the correlation between the expression levels of the nine ARGs and clinical and molecular features was visualized using a heatmap. This provided additional validation that the selected ARGs were relevant to the prognosis of UM patients.\n\nIn summary, the use of Lasso Cox regression effectively managed the high-dimensional nature of the data, preventing over-fitting by selecting the most relevant ARGs. The subsequent validation steps confirmed the prognostic value of the developed signature, ensuring that under-fitting was also avoided.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed the Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) Cox regression model as a regularization method to prevent overfitting. This technique is particularly useful in scenarios where the number of predictors is large compared to the number of observations, which was the case in our analysis of autophagy-related genes (ARGs) in uveal melanoma (UM) patients.\n\nThe Lasso regression helps in feature selection by shrinking the coefficients of less important features to zero, effectively performing both variable selection and regularization. This process ensures that the model is more interpretable and generalizable to new data, reducing the risk of overfitting.\n\nBy applying Lasso Cox regression, we were able to identify a subset of nine ARGs that significantly contributed to the prognostic signature. This subset was derived from an initial pool of 133 OS-related ARGs, demonstrating the effectiveness of Lasso in selecting the most relevant features for our prognostic model. The resulting 9-ARG signature showed robust predictive accuracy, as evidenced by the high area under the curve (AUC) values in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.",
  "optimization/config": "Not applicable.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in this study is not a blackbox. It is designed to be transparent and interpretable, providing clear insights into the prognostic prediction of uveal melanoma (UM) patients.\n\nThe model is based on a signature of nine autophagy-related genes (ARGs). The selection of these genes was performed using univariate and Lasso Cox regression analyses, which are statistical methods that help identify genes significantly associated with patient survival. This process ensures that each gene in the signature has a clear and measurable impact on the prognosis.\n\nThe risk score for each patient is calculated using a formula that incorporates the expression levels of these nine ARGs and their respective coefficients. The coefficients indicate the weight of each gene in the prognostic model, allowing for an understanding of which genes have a stronger influence on the risk score. For instance, genes with higher coefficients contribute more to the risk score, indicating a stronger association with patient outcomes.\n\nFurthermore, the model's transparency is enhanced by the functional enrichment analysis. This analysis reveals that the ARG-signature is correlated with several immune-related processes and pathways, such as T-cell activation and T-cell receptor signaling pathway. This provides biological context to the model, showing that the identified genes are involved in critical pathways related to cancer progression and immune response.\n\nAdditionally, the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) highlights tumor hallmarks enriched in high-risk UM patients, such as angiogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation. These findings further validate the biological relevance of the ARG-signature and its components.\n\nIn summary, the model's transparency is achieved through the clear selection process of the nine ARGs, the interpretable risk score formula, and the biological context provided by functional enrichment and GSEA. This makes the model not only predictive but also informative, offering insights into the underlying biological mechanisms of UM.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a regression model, specifically a prognostic model for predicting overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in uveal melanoma (UM) patients. The model uses a combination of univariate Cox regression and Lasso Cox regression to identify and integrate the expression of nine autophagy-related genes (ARGs) into a risk signature. This signature is then used to stratify patients into low- and high-risk groups, with the high-risk group exhibiting significantly worse survival outcomes. The model's predictive accuracy was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, which demonstrated high area under the curve (AUC) values for 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS predictions. The model was validated in multiple independent cohorts, confirming its robustness and stability. Additionally, the model's independent prognostic value was assessed using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, which showed that the risk stratification based on the ARG-signature is a significant and independent predictor of patient prognosis.",

  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the ARG-signature involved several key steps to ensure its robustness and predictive accuracy. Initially, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were employed to identify the independent prognostic role of the ARG-signature. These analyses were crucial in determining which autophagy-related genes (ARGs) were significantly associated with overall survival (OS) in uveal melanoma (UM) patients.\n\nTo develop the ARG-signature, a workflow was established that included examining the detection statuses of 531 ARGs across five cohorts. By taking the intersection of these detected ARGs, a list of 423 shared ARGs was obtained. Univariate Cox regression analysis identified 133 of these ARGs as being associated with OS in the TCGA cohort, with 39 ARGs being protective and 94 being risky. A Lasso Cox regression model was then applied to these 133 OS-related ARGs to establish a prognostic model for UM patients in the TCGA cohort. This resulted in a 9-ARG signature, which was visualized and summarized in relevant figures and tables.\n\nThe prognostic value of the ARG-signature was confirmed by dividing 80 UM patients into low- and high-risk groups based on the median risk score. Kaplan-Meier curves revealed that the low-risk subgroup had a higher survival rate and longer survival time compared to the high-risk subgroup. Additionally, the risk score demonstrated a high area under the curve (AUC) value for predicting 1/3/5-year OS, indicating robust predictive accuracy.\n\nThe ARG-signature was further validated in external cohorts, including GSE44295, GSE84976, and GSE22138. In these cohorts, patients were similarly divided into low- and high-risk groups, and survival analysis showed consistent results, with high-risk patients having lower OS rates and shorter OS times. ROC curve analysis in these external cohorts also confirmed the high prognostic predictive ability of the risk score.\n\nStatistical analyses were implemented using the R programming language (version 3.6.3), ensuring rigorous and reproducible methods. The associations between the 9-gene expression levels and clinical and molecular features were also investigated, providing additional insights into the prognostic significance of the ARG-signature.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed several performance metrics to evaluate the prognostic prediction accuracy of the ARG-signature. The primary metric used was the area under the curve (AUC) derived from receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. These ROC curves were plotted using the R package 'timeROC', and the AUC values were calculated to quantify the predictive power of the ARG-signature for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS).\n\nThe AUC values were reported for different time points, including 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year OS and DFS predictions across multiple cohorts. Notably, the AUC value for the 5-year OS prediction in the TCGA cohort and the 5-year DFS prediction in the GSE27831 cohort was 1.000. However, it is important to note that these high AUC values might be influenced by the small number of patients who lived longer than 5 years in these cohorts.\n\nIn addition to AUC, we also utilized the two-sided log-rank test to compare the OS and DFS between different risk subgroups or expression levels of ARGs. This statistical test was visualized using survival curves generated by the R package 'survival'.\n\nFurthermore, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to determine the independent prognostic role of the ARG-signature. These analyses were crucial in evaluating the significance of the ARG-signature in predicting patient outcomes.\n\nThe set of metrics used in our study is representative of those commonly reported in the literature for evaluating prognostic models in cancer research. The use of AUC from ROC curves, log-rank tests, and Cox regression analyses aligns with standard practices in the field, ensuring that our results are comparable to other studies.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "Not applicable.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "Evaluation Confidence\n\nThe evaluation of the ARG-signature's performance was conducted using several statistical methods to ensure confidence in the results. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were employed to determine the independent prognostic role of the ARG-signature. These analyses provided hazard ratios (HR) and P-values, indicating the significance of the association between the ARG-signature and overall survival (OS) of uveal melanoma (UM) patients. For instance, 133 out of 423 autophagy-related genes (ARGs) were found to be significantly associated with OS (P<0.05), with 39 being protective genes (HR<1) and 94 being risky genes (HR>1).\n\nThe prognostic model was developed using Lasso Cox regression, which helps in selecting the most relevant features and preventing overfitting. The coefficients of the nine ARGs included in the signature were visualized, and their significance was summarized. The risk scores calculated from these ARGs were used to stratify patients into low- and high-risk groups, with the median risk score serving as the cutoff.\n\nSurvival analysis using Kaplan-Meier curves showed a significant difference in OS between the low- and high-risk groups, with low-risk patients having a higher survival rate and longer survival time. The statistical significance of these differences was assessed, ensuring that the observed differences were not due to chance.\n\nReceiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the ARG-signature. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) values for 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS predictions were reported as 0.907, 0.953, and 1.000, respectively. These high AUC values indicate that the ARG-signature has a robust predictive accuracy.\n\nAdditionally, Pearson correlation analysis was used to assess the relationships between risk scores and immune-related scores, such as the ESTIMATE Score, Tumor Purity, Immune score, and Stromal score. The significance of these correlations was indicated with P-values, providing further confidence in the biological relevance of the ARG-signature.\n\nOverall, the evaluation of the ARG-signature included multiple statistical methods to ensure the reliability and significance of the results. The use of confidence intervals, P-values, and robust statistical tests provided a comprehensive assessment of the signature's performance and its potential clinical utility.",
