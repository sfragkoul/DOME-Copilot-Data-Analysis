  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset utilized in this study is derived from the Liverpool Lung Project (LLP). This project involved the recruitment of individuals from the Liverpool area, focusing on incident cases of histologically or cytologically confirmed lung cancer. The cases included individuals aged between 20 and 80 years, encompassing various topological subcategories of lung cancer as defined by the International Classification of Disease for Oncology, 9th revision.\n\nThe study population consists of 2385 subjects, comprising 718 cases and 1667 controls. These subjects were selected from individuals recruited into the LLP between 2000 and 2008. The controls were matched to the cases based on year of birth (\u00b12 years) and gender, ensuring a balanced and comparable dataset.\n\nThe data includes comprehensive information on epidemiological, clinical, and lifestyle factors. This information was collected through a standardized questionnaire and supplemented with hospital case note reviews conducted by trained research nurses. Key documented details include patients' smoking status and duration, previous history of pulmonary diseases such as pneumonia, COPD, and bronchitis, previous history of malignant diseases excluding skin melanoma, occupational exposure to asbestos, family history of lung cancer with age at onset, and case diagnosis details including the date of diagnosis, histological subtype, and staging.\n\nGenetic data consists of 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were independently validated from an initial screening of 157 SNPs in a candidate-gene discovery study. The selection and genotyping details of these SNPs have been described in previous work. The 20 SNPs were chosen based on their association with either the healthy smokers (protective) or lung cancer (susceptibility) phenotype, and they include variants related to the metabolism of smoking-derived carcinogens, inflammatory cytokines, smoking addiction, nicotine dependency, antioxidant response to smoking, cell cycle control, DNA repair and apoptosis, and integrins implicated in apoptosis.\n\nThe dataset has been used in previous studies, including the development of the LLP risk model, which involved 1362 subjects (418 cases and 914 controls). The current study builds upon this foundation by investigating the presence of epistasis among the panel of SNPs and assessing the contribution of adding an interactive epistatic effect to the clinical-based risk model for lung cancer.",
  "dataset/splits": "In our study, we employed 10-fold cross-validation to estimate the prediction error. This method involves dividing the data into 10 equal parts. The model was developed using 9/10 of the data, referred to as the training data, and then evaluated on the remaining 1/10 of the data, known as the independent testing data. This process is repeated for each possible combination of 9/10 and 1/10 of the data, resulting in ten prediction errors that are subsequently averaged.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized bootstrap samples for internal validation of the models. Specifically, 1000 bootstrap samples were drawn to adjust model parameters for overfitting. This approach helps ensure the robustness and generalizability of our findings.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The study utilized a dataset comprising 2385 subjects, divided into 718 cases and 1667 controls. To ensure robust model validation, a 10-fold cross-validation approach was employed. This method involved splitting the data into 10 equal parts, where the model was trained on 9/10 of the data and tested on the remaining 1/10. This process was repeated for each possible 9/10 and 1/10 split, resulting in ten prediction errors that were averaged to estimate the overall prediction error.\n\nThe training and test sets were kept independent by ensuring that each fold of the cross-validation used a different subset of the data for testing, which had not been used in the training phase. This independence was crucial for obtaining an unbiased estimate of the model's performance.\n\nThe distribution of the dataset in terms of age, gender, and smoking status was carefully documented. For instance, the age distribution showed that 25.9% of all subjects were under 60 years old, 38.2% were between 60 and 70 years old, and 35.9% were over 70 years old. Gender distribution was nearly equal, with 58.0% males and 42.0% females. Smoking status revealed that 25.9% of subjects had never smoked, 47.6% were former smokers, and 26.0% were current smokers.\n\nCompared to previously published machine learning datasets in lung cancer research, this study's dataset is notable for its larger sample size and detailed epidemiological and genetic information. The inclusion of 20 candidate SNPs, validated through a two-stage design, adds a layer of genetic interaction analysis that is less common in other studies. This comprehensive approach aims to improve the predictive accuracy of lung cancer risk models by incorporating both epidemiological and genetic factors.",
  "dataset/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our study primarily utilizes machine-learning techniques to enhance lung cancer risk prediction. Specifically, we used Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) and Random Forests (RF) to identify and evaluate the best single-locus or multi-locus predictors for lung cancer status.\n\nMDR is a non-parametric statistical method designed to detect and characterize interactions among discrete genetic and environmental factors. It seeks to find the best predictor(s) based on a balanced accuracy measure, which is the arithmetic mean of sensitivity and specificity. The prediction accuracy and cross-validation consistency are key metrics used to select the best Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in each 1 to 5-locus combination.\n\nRandom Forests, on the other hand, is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes of the individual trees. The importance of each SNP is determined by permuting the values of the SNP in the out-of-bag (oob) samples and comparing the classification accuracy before and after permutation. This process is repeated over all trees in the random forest to obtain the variable importance index.\n\nThese algorithms are well-established in the field of bioinformatics and genetics, and their application in our study is focused on improving the predictive power of lung cancer risk models by incorporating genetic interactions. The choice of these algorithms is driven by their ability to handle complex interactions among variables, which is crucial for understanding the genetic basis of lung cancer. While these methods are not new, their specific application to lung cancer risk prediction with the inclusion of epistatic interactions is novel and contributes to the existing literature in the field of oncology.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employed in this study utilizes data from multiple machine-learning algorithms as input, making it a meta-predictor. Specifically, it integrates results from Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) and Random Forest (RF) methods. MDR is used to identify the best single-locus or multi-locus predictors for explaining the outcome based on genomic information. It evaluates prediction accuracy and cross-validation consistency to select the best SNPs in various combinations. On the other hand, RF ranks variables by a variable importance index, reflecting the importance of a variable based on classification accuracy while considering interactions among variables.\n\nThe overall best classifier of lung cancer status was determined using both MDR and RF, with SNPs rs1799732 (DRD2), rs5744256 (IL-18), and rs2306022 (ITGA11) showing the highest training and testing accuracy, along with a cross-validation consistency of 10/10.\n\nRegarding the independence of training data, the use of 10-fold cross-validation ensures that the data are divided into 10 equal parts, with the model developed on 9/10 of the data and evaluated on the remaining 1/10. This process is repeated for each possible 9/10 and 1/10 of the data, ensuring that the training and testing sets are independent in each fold. Additionally, bootstrap correction for optimism is applied to address the lack of independent validation, further enhancing the robustness of the model.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure the genomic and epidemiological information was appropriately formatted and ready for analysis.\n\nGenomic data consisted of 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were independently validated from a larger set of 157 SNPs screened in a candidate-gene discovery study. These SNPs were selected based on their association with either the healthy smokers (protective) or lung cancer (susceptibility) phenotype. The SNPs covered various biological pathways, including metabolism of smoking-derived carcinogens, inflammatory cytokines, smoking addiction, nicotine dependency, antioxidant response to smoking, cell cycle control, DNA repair, apoptosis, and integrins.\n\nFor each SNP, three separate genotypes were analyzed. The data was preprocessed to check for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) to ensure the genotype frequencies were consistent with expected values. This step is crucial for validating the quality of the genotyping data.\n\nEpidemiological data included various characteristics such as age, gender, smoking status, smoking duration, previous history of pulmonary diseases, occupational exposure to asbestos, family history of lung cancer, and case diagnosis details. These variables were encoded and preprocessed to be compatible with the machine-learning algorithms used in the study.\n\nThe multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method was employed to investigate gene-gene interactions by identifying SNP combinations that provided the best discrimination of the subjects' status. MDR is a non-parametric, model-free method that utilizes a constructive induction technique to collapse high-dimensional genetic data into a single dimension. This method pools multi-locus genotypes into high and low-risk groups using an exhaustive search to identify optimal combinations of polymorphisms, which can then be evaluated for their ability to classify or predict disease status.\n\nAdditionally, the random forest (RF) method was used to rank variables by a variable importance index. This index reflects the importance of a variable based on classification accuracy while considering the interaction among variables. The RF method involved building multiple classification trees using bootstrap samples from the original cohort. Approximately one-third of the samples were left out of the bootstrap (out-of-bag) samples and not used in the construction of the tree. The importance of an SNP was determined by permuting the values of the SNP in the out-of-bag samples and comparing the correct classification rates between the original and permuted samples.\n\nIn summary, the data encoding and preprocessing involved validating the genomic data, encoding epidemiological variables, and using advanced machine-learning techniques to identify important SNP combinations and interactions. These steps ensured that the data was appropriately formatted and ready for analysis, enabling the development of accurate predictive models for lung cancer risk.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized a combination of epidemiological and genetic data to build and optimize our lung cancer risk model. The model incorporated several parameters, including both traditional risk factors and specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).\n\nThe selection of these parameters was guided by a comprehensive analytical approach. We employed cross-validation techniques, specifically 10-fold cross-validation, to estimate prediction errors and ensure the robustness of our model. This method involved dividing the data into 10 equal parts, training the model on 9/10 of the data, and evaluating it on the remaining 1/10. This process was repeated for each possible 9/10 and 1/10 split, and the resulting prediction errors were averaged.\n\nTo identify the best predictors, we used Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) to find single-locus or multi-locus predictors that explained the outcome based on a balanced accuracy measure. The prediction accuracy and cross-validation consistency were key metrics in selecting the best SNPs in each 1 to 5-locus combination.\n\nAdditionally, we used Random Forests (RF) to rank variables by a variable importance index, which indicated the importance of each variable based on classification accuracy while considering interactions among variables. The three SNPs\u2014rs1799732 (DRD2), rs5744256 (IL-18), and rs2306022 (ITGA11)\u2014were identified as the top classifiers of lung cancer status in MDR and were also ranked highly by RF.\n\nThe final model included these three SNPs along with epidemiological data, resulting in an extended model that demonstrated improved discriminatory ability and reclassification performance compared to the epidemiological model alone. The number of parameters (p) in the model was determined through this rigorous selection process, ensuring that only the most relevant and significant predictors were included.",
  "optimization/features": "In our study, we utilized a combination of epidemiological and genetic data to predict lung cancer risk. The input features consisted of epidemiological data, such as age, gender, smoking status, and other relevant clinical and lifestyle characteristics, along with genetic data from 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These SNPs were selected based on their association with lung cancer or related phenotypes in previous studies.\n\nFeature selection was performed using two main methods: Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) and Random Forest (RF). MDR is a non-parametric, model-free approach that identifies the best combination of SNPs for predicting lung cancer status. It uses a constructive induction technique to collapse high-dimensional genetic data into a single dimension, pooling multi-locus genotypes into high and low-risk groups. The Relief-F algorithm, implemented in MDR, was used initially to select SNPs most likely to interact. An exhaustive search of all possible 1-5 loci combinations was then explored using 10-fold cross-validation.\n\nRF, on the other hand, ranks variables by a variable importance index, which reflects the importance of a variable based on classification accuracy while considering interactions among variables. Several classification trees were created with replacement from the original data, and the importance of each SNP was determined by permuting its values in the out-of-bag (oob) samples and comparing the classification accuracy before and after permutation.\n\nThe feature selection process was conducted using the training data only, ensuring that the selected features were not influenced by the test data. This approach helped in identifying the most relevant SNPs and epidemiological factors for predicting lung cancer risk, enhancing the model's discriminatory ability and overall performance.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) and random forest (RF) methods to investigate gene-gene interactions by identifying SNP combinations that best discriminate between cases and controls. These methods are particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional genetic data, where the number of parameters (SNPs) can indeed be much larger than the number of training points (subjects).\n\nTo address the potential issue of overfitting, we utilized 10-fold cross-validation. This technique involves dividing the data into 10 equal parts, training the model on 9/10 of the data, and evaluating it on the remaining 1/10. This process is repeated for each possible 9/10 and 1/10 split, and the resulting prediction errors are averaged. This approach helps to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data and is not merely memorizing the training set.\n\nAdditionally, we assessed the prediction accuracy and cross-validation consistency. The latter is defined as the number of cross-validation replicates in which the same n-locus predictor was chosen as the best predictor of lung cancer status. This metric helps to ensure that the selected SNPs are robust and not due to random chance.\n\nTo rule out underfitting, we evaluated the model's performance using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the net reclassification improvement (NRI). The AUC provides a measure of the model's ability to discriminate between cases and controls, while the NRI assesses the improvement in risk prediction when SNPs are incorporated into the model. Both metrics showed significant improvements when epistatic data were included, indicating that the model is complex enough to capture the underlying patterns in the data.\n\nFurthermore, we used the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayes information criterion (BIC) to assess model fit. The reduction in AIC and BIC when SNPs were added to the epidemiological model suggests that the extended model is a better fit to the data, further supporting that underfitting is not a concern.\n\nIn summary, we employed cross-validation, prediction accuracy, cross-validation consistency, AUC, NRI, AIC, and BIC to ensure that our model neither overfits nor underfits the data. These measures provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance and robustness.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure the robustness of our models. One key method used was cross-validation, specifically 10-fold cross-validation. This technique involves dividing the data into 10 equal parts, training the model on 9/10 of the data, and evaluating it on the remaining 1/10. This process is repeated for each possible 9/10 and 1/10 split, and the resulting prediction errors are averaged. This approach helps to estimate the prediction error more accurately and reduces the risk of overfitting.\n\nAdditionally, we utilized bootstrap techniques for internal validation of the models. Bootstrap samples were drawn 1000 times to adjust model parameters for overfitting. This method involves repeatedly sampling with replacement from the original dataset to create multiple simulated samples, which are then used to train and validate the model. By averaging the results from these multiple samples, we can obtain a more stable and generalizable model.\n\nFurthermore, we assessed model fit using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayes Information Criterion (BIC). These criteria penalize models with a larger number of parameters, thereby encouraging the selection of simpler models that are less likely to overfit the data. The reduction in AIC and BIC values when SNPs were incorporated into the model indicated an improvement in model fit without overfitting.\n\nOverall, these techniques collectively helped to ensure that our models were robust, generalizable, and not overly fitted to the training data.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not a blackbox, as it incorporates interpretable components that allow for the understanding of variable importance and interactions. The use of Random Forests (RF) is a key aspect of this interpretability. RF ranks variables by a variable importance index, which indicates the importance of a variable based on classification accuracy while considering interactions among variables. This approach provides insights into which genetic markers (SNPs) are most influential in predicting lung cancer risk.\n\nFor instance, the three SNPs\u2014rs1799732 (DRD2), rs5744256 (IL-18), and rs2306022 (ITGA11)\u2014were identified as the top classifiers of lung cancer status. These SNPs were not only selected by Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) but also ranked highly by RF using the variable importance index. This dual validation enhances the transparency and reliability of the model.\n\nAdditionally, the study utilized multivariable logistic regression to generate estimates of predicted 5-year absolute risk of lung cancer. This method allows for the assessment of the contribution of each variable, including SNPs and epidemiological factors, to the overall risk prediction. The model's transparency is further supported by the use of the net reclassification improvement (NRI) metric, which quantifies the degree of correct classification and demonstrates the added value of including SNPs in the risk model.\n\nThe model's interpretability is crucial for clinical applications, as it enables healthcare providers to understand the underlying factors contributing to an individual's lung cancer risk. This understanding can guide personalized prevention and treatment strategies, making the model more than just a predictive tool but also an informative one.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a classification model. It is designed to predict lung cancer status, specifically categorizing individuals into different risk groups based on their predicted 5-year absolute risk of developing lung cancer. The model uses a combination of epidemiological data and genetic information, particularly single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), to enhance its predictive accuracy.\n\nThe classification performance of the model was evaluated using metrics such as training and testing accuracy, cross-validation consistency, and the area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUC). The model's ability to discriminate between cases and controls improved when SNPs were incorporated, as evidenced by an increase in the AUC from 0.75 to 0.81. This indicates that the model is effective in classifying individuals into different risk categories for lung cancer.\n\nAdditionally, the model's performance was assessed using net reclassification improvement (NRI), which showed a modest improvement in risk prediction when SNPs were included. The reclassification of individuals into different risk groups demonstrated that the model could better identify those at high risk of developing lung cancer, thereby potentially improving early detection and prevention strategies.\n\nIn summary, the model is a classification tool that leverages both epidemiological and genetic data to predict lung cancer risk, with demonstrated improvements in accuracy and discriminatory power when SNPs are included.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time for the model was not explicitly detailed in the publication. However, the model involved several computational steps, including the use of random forests and logistic regression, which are known to be computationally intensive. The random forest analysis, for instance, involved constructing 10,000 trees, which would have required significant processing power and time. Additionally, the model underwent extensive validation processes, including 1000-fold permutation tests and bootstrap sampling, further contributing to the overall execution time. While specific durations are not provided, it is clear that the model's development and validation were resource-intensive and likely took a considerable amount of time to complete.",
  "model/availability": "The software used in this study, specifically the Willows package for generating Random Forests (RF), is freely available. This package was utilized to rank variables by a variable importance index, which reflects the importance of a variable based on classification accuracy while considering interactions among variables. The Willows software is designed to be memory efficient and facilitates the construction of classification trees. It employs a recursive partitioning method, where each tree is constructed using different bootstrap samples from the original cohort. Approximately one-third of the samples are left out of the bootstrap (out-of-bag or oob) samples and are not used in the construction of the tree. The number of trees was set to 10,000, and default parameter values provided by the program were used. The software allows for the determination of the importance of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) by randomly permuting the values of the SNP in the oob samples and then classifying both the original and permuted oob samples by the corresponding tree. The difference in correct classification rates between the original and permuted oob samples determines the importance of the SNP, and the variable importance is obtained by averaging the differences over all trees in the random forest. The Willows package is a valuable tool for assessing the significance of genetic markers in predictive models.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method employed in this study involved several rigorous techniques to assess the performance and validity of the lung cancer risk model incorporating epistatic interactions of SNPs.\n\nCross-validation was utilized to estimate the prediction error. Specifically, 10-fold cross-validation was applied, where the data was divided into 10 equal parts. The model was developed on 9/10 of the data (training data) and then evaluated on the remaining 1/10 of the data (testing data). This process was repeated for each possible 9/10 and 1/10 split, and the resulting ten prediction errors were averaged. This approach ensured that the model's performance was robust and not dependent on a particular subset of the data.\n\nThe Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) method was used to identify the best single-locus or multi-locus predictors for explaining the outcome, based on a balanced accuracy measure. The prediction accuracy and cross-validation consistency were key metrics in selecting the best SNPs in each 1 to 5-locus combination. Cross-validation consistency referred to the number of cross-validation replicates in which the same n-locus predictor was chosen as the best predictor of lung cancer status.\n\nTo further validate the model, a 1000-fold permutation test was conducted to statistically evaluate the SNP classifier of lung cancer status. This test helped to determine the significance of the selected SNPs.\n\nAdditionally, the Willows software package was used to generate Random Forests (RF), which ranked variables by a variable importance index. This index reflected the importance of a variable based on classification accuracy while considering interactions among variables. The RF method involved building multiple classification trees using bootstrap samples from the original cohort, with approximately one-third of the samples left out of the bootstrap (out-of-bag samples) to assess the importance of each SNP.\n\nThe area under the receiver-operating characteristics (AUC) was used to assess the discriminatory ability of the models and to compare models with and without SNPs. The increase in AUC was evaluated and tested for significance using the DeLong test. Furthermore, the net reclassification improvement (NRI) was used to assess the added discrimination offered by the inclusion of SNPs in the risk model.\n\nBootstrapping techniques were utilized for internal validation of the models, with bootstrap samples drawn 1000 times to adjust model parameters for overfitting. Improvement in model calibration was assessed using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayes information criterion (BIC), which indicated a reduction in these criteria when SNPs were included in the model.\n\nThe study also involved comparing the models with and without SNPs using epidemiological data and extended models with both genetic and epidemiological data. The baseline risk for the prediction of 5-year absolute risk was recalculated to include information on specific SNPs.\n\nOverall, the evaluation method combined cross-validation, permutation testing, random forests, AUC analysis, NRI, and bootstrapping to ensure a comprehensive and robust assessment of the lung cancer risk model incorporating epistatic interactions of SNPs.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we utilized a comprehensive set of performance metrics to evaluate the contribution of adding an interactive epistatic effect to a risk model for lung cancer. The primary metric we reported is the Area Under the Curve (AUC), which is widely recognized as the most popular metric for measuring the discriminatory power of a model to correctly classify subjects with or without a disease. Our results showed an 8% increase in AUC for the extended model with SNPs compared to the epidemiological model without SNPs. This increase was statistically significant, with a DeLong's test P-value of 2.2e-16.\n\nIn addition to AUC, we also employed reclassification metrics to assess the improvement in model performance. Specifically, we used the Net Reclassification Index (NRI), which quantifies the degree of correct classification. Our findings demonstrated a 17.5% improvement in the risk classification of subjects when SNPs were added to the model. This supports the notion that even a modest increase in AUC can lead to a substantial improvement in reclassification.\n\nFurthermore, we evaluated model fit using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayes Information Criterion (BIC). Both criteria showed a reduction in values for the extended model with SNPs, indicating an improvement in model fit. The AIC decreased from 2098.42 to 1930.14, and the BIC decreased from 2167.75 to 2016.80.\n\nWe also reported the odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) from multivariate logistic regression models for both the epidemiological model and the extended model with SNPs. The comparable ORs and CIs suggest the absence of any serious confounding effects of SNPs on the relationship between other clinical and epidemiological risk factors and lung cancer risk.\n\nOverall, the set of metrics we reported is representative of current standards in the literature, providing a thorough evaluation of both the discriminatory power and the reclassification improvement of our model.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "A comparison to publicly available methods was performed using the Willows software package for generating Random Forests (RF). This package ranks variables by a variable importance index, which reflects the importance of a variable based on classification accuracy while considering interactions among variables. The RF method was used to determine the importance of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by permuting their values in out-of-bag (oob) samples and comparing the classification accuracy before and after permutation.\n\nThe study also employed a classification tree built by the recursive partitioning method, where each tree was constructed using different bootstrap samples from the original cohort. Approximately one-third of the samples were left out of the bootstrap samples and not used in the construction of the tree. This process was repeated with 10,000 trees to ensure robustness.\n\nIn addition to comparing with the RF method, the study used multivariable logistic regression to generate estimates of predicted 5-year absolute risk of lung cancer. This was done for two models: one with epidemiological data and another extended model that included both genetic and epidemiological data. The area under the receiver-operating characteristics (AUC) was used to assess the discriminatory ability of these models and to compare them with and without SNPs. The increase in AUC was evaluated and tested for significance using the DeLong test.\n\nBootstrapping techniques were utilized for internal validation of the models, with 1000 bootstrap samples drawn to adjust model parameters for overfitting. The improvement in model calibration was assessed using the Akaike information criterion.\n\nThe study also performed cross-validation to estimate prediction error by leaving out a portion of the data as an independent test set. With 10-fold cross-validation, the data were divided into 10 equal parts, and the model was developed on 9/10 of the data and then evaluated on the remaining 1/10 of the data. This process was repeated for each possible 9/10 and 1/10 of the data, and the resulting ten prediction errors were averaged. This approach allowed for the selection of the best SNPs in each 1 to 5-locus combination based on prediction accuracy and cross-validation consistency.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of the lung cancer risk model incorporating epistatic interactions of SNPs was conducted using several performance metrics, each with associated confidence intervals to assess their reliability.\n\nThe area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) was a primary metric used to evaluate the discriminatory power of the models. The AUC for the epidemiological model was reported as 0.75 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.73 to 0.77. When epistatic data were incorporated into the extended model, the AUC increased to 0.81 with a 95% CI of 0.79 to 0.83. This 8% increase in AUC was statistically significant, as indicated by a DeLong's test P-value of 2.2e-16.\n\nThe net reclassification improvement (NRI) was another crucial metric used to quantify the degree of correct classification. The addition of SNPs led to a 17.5% improvement in risk classification, demonstrating a substantial enhancement in the model's performance. The NRI was estimated at 13.5% with a P-value of less than 0.001, indicating statistical significance.\n\nModel fit was assessed using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayes information criterion (BIC). The AIC decreased from 2098.42 in the epidemiological model to 1930.14 in the extended model with SNPs, and the BIC decreased from 2167.75 to 2016.80, respectively. These reductions indicate an improvement in model fit when SNPs were included.\n\nThe statistical significance of the results supports the claim that the extended model with SNPs is superior to the epidemiological model without SNPs. The confidence intervals and P-values provide a robust basis for asserting the reliability and validity of the findings.",
  "evaluation/availability": "The raw evaluation files are not publicly available. The study utilized data from the Liverpool Lung Project (LLP), which includes genotype data from 2385 individuals. This data was used to validate SNPs identified in a candidate-gene genetic association study. The evaluation involved assessing the contribution of adding an interactive epistatic effect to a clinical-based risk model for lung cancer. The models were validated using area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUC) analysis and net reclassification improvement (NRI).
