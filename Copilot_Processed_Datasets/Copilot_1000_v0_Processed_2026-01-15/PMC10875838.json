  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was collected from participants recruited at the Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. A total of 70 participants were enrolled, comprising 35 individuals diagnosed with dry eye disease (DED) and 35 age- and gender-matched normal controls (NC). Each participant contributed both eyes, resulting in a total of 140 eyes analyzed. The participants were aged between 18 and 35 years to minimize the impact of age on blinking patterns.\n\nThe diagnostic criteria for DED included an ocular surface disease index (OSDI) score of 13 or higher, along with at least one of the following signs: tear film break-up time of 5 seconds or less, or a Schirmer\u2019s I test result of less than 10 mm in 5 minutes. These criteria align with the guidelines set by the Asia Dry Eye Society.\n\nExclusion criteria for the study included previous ocular trauma, ocular surgeries, active ocular diseases other than DED, eyelid diseases, wearing contact lenses within a week before examinations, use of eye drops (except for preservative-free artificial tears more than 4 hours before examination), systemic medication use, and pregnancy.\n\nThe data collected included various clinical assessments such as the OSDI score, non-invasive tear film break-up time (NIBUT), fluorescein tear film break-up time (FBUT), Schirmer\u2019s I test (SIT), fluorescein corneal staining (FCS), tear meniscus height (TMH), and meibography. Blinking assessments were conducted in a controlled environment with adjustable lighting.\n\nThe study utilized a deep learning model (DLM) to analyze blinking videos and detect abnormal blinking patterns, particularly in distinguishing DED patients from normal subjects. The DLM-assisted Keratograph 5M (K5M) was compared with the Lipiview device for measuring blinking parameters, and the DLM-assisted K5M demonstrated higher consistency and reliability in its measurements.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used is deep learning. The specific model employed is a deep learning machine (DLM), which has been developed and trained for blinking analysis. This DLM is not a novel algorithm in the traditional sense of being a new class of machine-learning technique. Instead, it represents an application of existing deep learning methodologies tailored to the specific task of analyzing blinking patterns in eye videos.\n\nThe reason this DLM was not published in a machine-learning journal is likely due to the focus of the study. The primary objective of the research was to demonstrate the clinical utility of the DLM-assisted Keratograph 5M (K5M) in diagnosing dry eye disease (DED) rather than to introduce a new machine-learning algorithm. The study emphasizes the practical application of deep learning in medical diagnostics, showcasing how the DLM can provide more sensitive and consistent blinking parameter measurements compared to existing tools like Lipiview. This application-driven approach is more aligned with the scope of journals in ophthalmology and vision science, where the clinical relevance and diagnostic accuracy of the method are of paramount importance.",
  "optimization/meta": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several steps to ensure the quality and consistency of the input data. The blinking videos were recorded using the Keratograph 5M (K5M) in a specific mode that provided high frame rate (30 frames per second) and black/white imaging, which facilitated the analysis of eyelid movements. The illumination was set to a bright white light of around 300 lux to ensure clear visibility of the interpalpebral zone.\n\nThe recorded videos were then processed to extract frames that showed the movement of the eyelids during blinking. These frames were used to generate a blinking profile, where the interpalpebral fissure height (IPH) was measured in each frame. The IPH values were normalized by the total height of the image (512 pixels) to create a ratio that could be used for analysis. This ratio was plotted against the video frames to generate a blinking curve, which visually represented the blinking activity.\n\nThe dataset used for training the deep learning model (DLM) consisted of 1019 images, which were labeled to indicate the interpalpebral zone and the maximum IPH. The segmentation performance of the DLM was assessed on a new dataset consisting of 140 eyes to ensure its accuracy. The blinking parameters generated from the DLM were compared to manually counted parameters to validate the model's performance.\n\nThe preprocessing steps included fixing the illumination at 100 lux during the recording of blinking assessments. The videos were recorded for one minute for each eye, and the blinking parameters were extracted from these videos. The DLM was trained to segment the interpalpebral zone and measure the IPH in each frame, which were then used to generate the blinking profile. The model's performance was validated on a separate dataset to ensure its reliability and accuracy in analyzing blinking patterns.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the deep learning model (DLM) utilized several key parameters to analyze blinking patterns. The primary parameter is the interpalpebral fissure height (IPH), which is the vertical distance between the upper and lower eyelids. This parameter is crucial as it helps in identifying blinks and incomplete blinks (IBs) by tracking changes in IPH over time.\n\nThe selection of these parameters was based on extensive validation and comparison with manually counted blinking parameters. The model was trained and validated on a dataset consisting of 1019 images, ensuring that the selected parameters were robust and reliable. Additionally, the model's performance was assessed on an independent dataset, which included metrics such as the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Intersection over Union (IOU), Balanced Accuracy (BAC), and Sensitivity (SEN). These metrics provided a comprehensive evaluation of the model's accuracy and consistency in detecting blinking parameters.\n\nThe model's ability to distinguish between normal and dry eye disease (DED) subjects was also a critical factor in parameter selection. The DLM-assisted Keratograph 5M (K5M) demonstrated higher sensitivity and consistency in acquiring blinking parameters compared to the Lipiview device. This was evident in the uniformity of parameters between the right and left eyes, as well as the model's capacity to capture a higher number of blinks and IBs in DED patients.\n\nFurthermore, the model's parameters were validated through various statistical analyses, including Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient and Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient. These analyses showed strong correlations between the blinking parameters and clinical evaluations, such as Non-Invasive Tear Film Break-Up Time (NIBUT), Fluorescein Tear Film Break-Up Time (FBUT), Schirmer\u2019s I Test (SIT), and Lipid Layer Thickness (LLT). This validation process ensured that the selected parameters were not only technically sound but also clinically relevant.\n\nIn summary, the model uses the IPH as the primary parameter, supported by a robust validation process and comprehensive statistical analyses. This approach ensures that the model is both accurate and clinically useful in diagnosing and monitoring dry eye disease.",

  "model/interpretability": "The deep learning model (DLM) used in our study is not entirely a black box. While deep learning models are often criticized for their lack of interpretability, our approach includes several features that enhance transparency.\n\nFirstly, the DLM provides visual outputs that make the blinking analysis more interpretable. For instance, the interpalpebral zone is labeled in green, and the maximum interpalpebral fissure height is marked with a vertical blue line in each frame of the video. This segmentation result is clearly visible and helps in understanding how the model is analyzing the blinking process.\n\nAdditionally, the DLM generates a blinking profile that plots the ratio of the interpalpebral fissure height (IPH) to the total height of the image over time. This profile includes a red line representing the base IPH and red stars marking each blink in the video. This visual representation allows clinicians to see the blinking patterns and understand the model's output in a more intuitive way.\n\nFurthermore, the DLM's performance was validated against manually counted blinking parameters, and the results were compared in supplementary tables. This comparison helps in understanding the consistency and reliability of the DLM's outputs.\n\nWhile the internal workings of the DLM may still be complex and not fully transparent, these visual outputs and validation steps make the model's analysis more interpretable and trustworthy for clinical use.",
  "model/output": "The model in question is a deep learning machine (DLM) designed for blinking analysis, specifically for the Keratograph 5M (K5M). It is primarily used for classification tasks, distinguishing between normal blinking patterns and those associated with dry eye disease (DED). The model analyzes blinking videos to detect and quantify blinking parameters such as the number of blinks, number of incomplete blinks (IB), and IB rate. These parameters are then used to differentiate between DED patients and normal subjects. The DLM-assisted K5M has shown better consistency and sensitivity in acquiring blinking parameters compared to Lipiview, making it a valuable tool for DED diagnosis. The model's output includes blinking profiles and curves that visualize the interpalpebral fissure height over time, aiding in the identification of abnormal blinking patterns.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time for the model was not explicitly detailed in the publication. However, it is worth noting that the model was applied to analyze 1-minute blinking videos recorded by the Keratograph 5M (K5M) at a high frame rate of 30 frames per second. This setup suggests that the model is designed to handle real-time or near real-time video analysis, which implies efficient processing capabilities. Additionally, the model's ability to analyze videos and generate blinking profiles indicates that it is optimized for timely performance, although specific execution times were not provided.",

  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method involved a comprehensive assessment of the deep learning model (DLM) for blinking analysis using the Keratograph 5M (K5M). The segmentation performance of the DLM was initially validated on a new dataset consisting of 140 eyes. This validation included comparing the blinking parameters generated by the DLM with manually counted parameters to ensure accuracy.\n\nBlinking assessments were conducted using both Lipiview and K5M devices on both eyes of participants in a randomized order. The K5M was set to a specific mode that provided a bright white light, and a 1-minute blinking video was recorded for each eye. The Lipiview device, which uses a flashing white light to detect lipid layer thickness, recorded a 20-second video of the tear film. Videos with a conformance factor over 0.7 were saved for blinking analysis.\n\nThe study enrolled 70 participants, divided into two groups: 35 with dry eye disease (DED) and 35 normal controls (NC). The participants were aged between 18 and 35 years to minimize the impact of age on blinking patterns. The diagnostic criteria for DED included an ocular surface disease index (OSDI) score of 13 or higher and at least one of the following signs: tear film break-up time of 5 seconds or less, or a Schirmer\u2019s I test result of less than 10 mm/5 minutes.\n\nStatistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 21.0 and Prism 8.0. The sample size was calculated with a significance level of 0.05 and a power of 0.9, resulting in a minimum of 28 participants per group, with 35 participants ultimately recruited for each group. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to determine the normality of the data. Bland-Altman analysis was performed to evaluate the consistency between the devices and measurements, with Lipiview parameters set as the gold standard. Intra-individual and inter-individual biological variations were calculated, and the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to evaluate the measurement consistency of Lipiview and DLM-assisted K5M.\n\nThe study also compared blinking parameters between DED patients and normal controls using generalized estimating equations. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic efficiency of blinking parameters based on the diagnosis of each DED patient and the examination results of the right eye. A two-tailed P value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. The results showed that the DED group had a higher OSDI score, shorter non-invasive tear break-up time (NIBUT) and fluorescein tear film break-up time (FBUT), lower Schirmer\u2019s I test (SIT) value, and higher fluorescein corneal staining (FCS) compared to the normal control group. However, no statistical differences were found in tear meniscus height (TMH), meiboscore, or lipid layer thickness (LLT) between the two groups.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed several performance metrics to evaluate the diagnostic efficiency and consistency of blinking parameters measured by different devices. The primary metric used was the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, which helped assess the diagnostic efficiency of blinking parameters based on the diagnosis of each dry eye disease (DED) patient and the examination results of the right eye. A two-tailed P value less than 0.05 was considered significant in our analyses.\n\nWe also utilized the Bland-Altman plot to evaluate the agreements between devices on measuring blinking parameters. This plot helped us determine the limits of agreement and identify any biases between the devices. Additionally, we calculated the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) to evaluate the consistency of measurements between the right and left eyes, assuming that the two eyes from a single person have the same blinking pattern.\n\nGeneralized estimating equations were used to compare blinking parameters between different groups and devices. This statistical method allowed us to account for the correlations within subjects and provide more accurate comparisons.\n\nPearson\u2019s and Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficients were calculated to evaluate the correlations between blinking parameters and various DED measurements. These correlations helped us understand the relationships between different clinical evaluations and blinking parameters.\n\nThe area under the curve (AUC) from the ROC analysis was used to compare the efficiency of DED diagnosis between the two devices. This metric provided a single value that summarized the overall performance of the diagnostic test.\n\nOverall, the set of metrics used in our study is representative of those commonly reported in the literature for evaluating diagnostic tools and consistency in ophthalmic research. These metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of the performance and reliability of the blinking parameters measured by the devices in our study.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we conducted a thorough comparison of blinking parameters using two different devices: Lipiview and the Keratograph 5M (K5M) assisted by a deep learning model (DLM). This comparison was essential to evaluate the consistency and reliability of the DLM-assisted K5M in measuring blinking parameters.\n\nThe Lipiview device, which uses a flashing white light to detect lipid layer thickness and records a 20-second video of the tear film, was used as a benchmark. The blinking parameters generated by Lipiview were compared to those obtained from the DLM-assisted K5M. The K5M was set to record a 1-minute blinking video for each eye under specific conditions, including high frame rate and black/white illumination.\n\nTo assess the agreement between the two devices, we employed the Bland-Altman plot. This analysis revealed that the limits of agreement were wider than the previously set minimum bias for both the number of blinks and the number of incomplete blinks (IB). Notably, Lipiview captured a smaller number of blinks but a higher number of IB compared to the DLM-assisted K5M.\n\nIn addition to the Bland-Altman analysis, we evaluated the consistency of measurements using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). The DLM-assisted K5M demonstrated higher ICC values across all three parameters\u2014number of blinks, number of IB, and IB rate\u2014indicating better consistency in measurements.\n\nFurthermore, we compared the blinking parameters between the dry eye disease (DED) group and the normal control (NC) group using both devices. The DLM-assisted K5M revealed statistical differences in the number of blinks, number of IB, and IB rate between the two groups. In contrast, Lipiview only showed differences in the number of blinks and number of IB.\n\nOverall, our comparison to the publicly available Lipiview method and the simpler baseline measurements provided valuable insights into the performance and reliability of the DLM-assisted K5M in analyzing blinking parameters. The results highlight the strengths and potential improvements of the DLM-assisted K5M in clinical settings.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our study's performance metrics included statistical significance assessments to ensure the robustness of our findings. We used a two-tailed P value threshold of less than 0.05 to determine statistical significance. This threshold was applied across various comparisons, including the diagnostic efficiency of blinking parameters and the consistency of measurements between devices.\n\nFor instance, the diagnostic efficiency of blinking parameters was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which provided sensitivity and specificity values. The number of incomplete blinks (IB) from the Keratograph 5M (K5M) device showed a sensitivity of 74.29% and specificity of 71.43% with a cut-off point greater than eight, indicating a significant diagnostic capability.\n\nAdditionally, we performed Bland-Altman analysis to evaluate the agreement between devices, which showed that the limits of agreement were wider than the previously set minimum bias. This analysis helped us understand the consistency and potential biases between the Lipiview and DLM-assisted K5M devices.\n\nThe intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to assess the measurement consistency of the Lipiview and DLM-assisted K5M devices. The DLM-assisted K5M demonstrated higher ICC values in all three parameters (number of blinks, number of IB, and IB rate), indicating better consistency.\n\nStatistical tests such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, \u03c72 test, and Pearson\u2019s or Spearman\u2019s rank correlation were employed to ensure the validity of our comparisons. For example, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to determine the normality of data, and Pearson\u2019s or Spearman\u2019s rank correlation was performed to assess the correlations between parameters.\n\nOverall, the performance metrics in our study were rigorously evaluated with statistical significance in mind, providing confidence in the superiority and reliability of our methods compared to baselines and other devices.",

The study includes supplementary materials like figures and tables that provide detailed information about the performance of the deep learning model and the comparison of blinking parameters. However, the specific raw data files used for the evaluations are not released to the public.
