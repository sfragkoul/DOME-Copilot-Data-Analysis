  "dataset/provenance": "Three longitudinal microbiome datasets were utilized, each with distinct characteristics. The first dataset originated from a study by Caporaso et al., which tracked two healthy individuals\u2014a male and a female\u2014over extended periods (15 months for the male and 6 months for the female), with an average sampling interval of 1.12 days. This dataset is notable for its density and long-term tracking.\n\nThe second dataset, published by Poyet et al., includes data from healthy fecal microbiota transplant donors. From this dataset, individuals with at least 50 available samples were selected, resulting in data from 9 individuals across 956 time points over 7\u201318 months.\n\nThe third dataset, from de Muinck and Trosvik, followed 12 infants during their first year of life, with near-daily sampling, yielding a total of 2,684 samples. This dataset presents a unique challenge due to the significant microbiome changes that occur during infancy.\n\nFeature tables for the Caporaso et al. dataset were obtained directly from the original publication. For the Poyet et al. and de Muinck and Trosvik datasets, feature tables were calculated from 16S read data using the QIIME2 pipeline. Denoising was performed with dada2, the phylogenetic tree was constructed using the q2-fragment-insertion plugin and SEPP technique, and taxonomy classification was extracted using the q2-feature-classifier plugin based on a na\u00efve-Bayes classifier and the SILVA 99 database.\n\nFor each participant, the 30 most abundant taxa across all time points were considered, with the abundances of all other taxa summed and classified as \"others.\" This approach is consistent with previous works and helps focus on taxa with more reliable measured abundance.",
  "dataset/splits": "Three data splits were utilized in this study, each with distinct characteristics and sample sizes.\n\nThe first split originated from a study that tracked two individuals\u2014a healthy male and a healthy female\u2014over extended periods, with the male monitored for 15 months and the female for 6 months. The average sampling interval was approximately 1.12 days.\n\nThe second split included data from healthy fecal microbiota transplant donors, focusing on individuals with at least 50 available samples. This resulted in data from 9 individuals, encompassing 956 time points over a period ranging from 7 to 18 months.\n\nThe third split involved data from a study that followed 12 infants during their first year of life, with samples collected on a near-daily basis, totaling 2,684 samples. This dataset presented a unique challenge due to the significant changes in the microbiome that occur during infancy.",

  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm employed in our study falls under the class of regression-based machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we utilized the maximum likelihood unconstrained ridge regression algorithm (MLRR), which was suggested by Stein et al. This algorithm is not new; it has been previously established in the literature. The choice to use this algorithm in our study was driven by its effectiveness in minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) in regression problems, making it suitable for inferring the parameters in our model.\n\nAdditionally, we implemented the LIMITS algorithm, proposed by Fisher et al. This algorithm also focuses on minimizing the MSE and was used alongside MLRR to provide a robust comparison and validation of our results. Both algorithms were applied using their default parameters as presented in the original papers.\n\nThe decision to use these specific algorithms was based on their proven performance in similar contexts and their ability to handle the complexities of microbiome data. While these algorithms are well-known in the field of statistics and machine learning, their application to microbiome studies is particularly relevant due to the unique challenges posed by the data, such as the need to account for varying time intervals between samples.\n\nThe algorithms were not published in a machine-learning journal because they were originally developed and validated in the context of statistical modeling and have since been adapted for use in various scientific domains, including microbiome research. Their application in our study demonstrates their versatility and effectiveness in handling the specific challenges of longitudinal microbiome data analysis.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model described in the publication is a linear mixed effects model (LMM) that incorporates data from various interpolation methods to predict the logit product of the Bray-Curtis similarity score between the interpolation results and the real abundance. This approach can be considered a form of meta-predictor, as it leverages the outputs of multiple machine-learning algorithms as input features.\n\nThe fixed effect variables in the model include the number of samples from an individual, the time difference from the preceding sample and to the subsequent sample, and the logit transformation of the interpolation accuracy using the Bray-Curtis similarity score in the preceding and subsequent samples. These fixed effects are derived from the performance of different interpolation methods, such as KNN, MLRR, gLV, LIMITS, splines, and DBN, among others.\n\nThe interpolation methods that constitute the whole meta-predictor include a range of techniques that have been evaluated for their ability to predict microbiome composition at missing time points. These methods vary in their approach and complexity, from simple techniques like the \"equal\" method, which predicts the same abundance for all taxa, to more sophisticated methods like KNN with an Epanechnikov kernel, which has shown high interpolation accuracy in most settings.\n\nRegarding the independence of the training data, it is implied that the model uses cross-validation, specifically a leave-one-out approach, to evaluate the interpolation accuracy of each method. In this approach, for each individual, each available sample (except for the first and last time points) is systematically omitted, and the composition of the omitted sample is inferred based on all remaining samples. This process ensures that the training data for each prediction is independent of the test data, maintaining the integrity of the model's evaluation.\n\nThe model's performance is assessed using the Bray-Curtis similarity metric, which quantifies the degree of similarity between the inferred and real composition. The results indicate that the model is reliable for predicting interpolation accuracy, with a mean absolute error below 0.1 across all methods and a high Spearman correlation between the expected and real interpolation accuracy. This suggests that the meta-predictor can effectively integrate the strengths of various interpolation methods to provide accurate predictions of microbiome composition at missing time points.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, we utilized three distinct longitudinal microbiome datasets, each with unique characteristics, to ensure a broad representation of variability found in such studies. The first dataset, from Caporaso et al., tracked two individuals over extended periods, with frequent sampling intervals. The second dataset, by Poyet et al., included data from healthy fecal microbiota transplant donors, with a focus on individuals having at least 50 samples. The third dataset, by de Muinck and Trosvik, followed infants during their first year of life, providing near-daily samples.\n\nFor data preprocessing, feature tables were obtained directly from publications or calculated using the QIIME2 pipeline. This involved denoising with dada2, constructing phylogenetic trees with the q2-fragment-insertion plugin and SEPP technique, and classifying taxonomy using the q2-feature-classifier plugin based on a na\u00efve-Bayes classifier and the SILVA 99 database.\n\nTo focus on the most reliable taxa, we considered only the 30 most abundant taxa for each participant, measured by the sum of taxa\u2019s relative abundance across all time points. The abundance of all other taxa was aggregated and classified as \"others.\" This approach aligns with previous works and ensures that the taxa with the most significant impact on microbiome composition are prioritized.\n\nFor interpolation methods, we implemented a variety of techniques, including na\u00efve methods like median and average abundance, machine learning approaches such as dynamic Bayesian networks, and ecological modeling using the generalized Lotka-Volterra equations. Each method was evaluated using a leave-one-out cross-validation approach, where each available sample was systematically omitted, and the composition was inferred based on the remaining samples. The accuracy of each method was quantified using the Bray-Curtis similarity metric.\n\nAdditionally, we normalized the data to account for varying time differences between samples, which is crucial for the assumptions underlying the generalized Lotka-Volterra equations. This normalization involved dividing by the time difference between adjacent time points, ensuring that the interpolation methods could accurately model the dynamics of microbiome composition over time.\n\nOverall, our data encoding and preprocessing steps were designed to ensure robustness and reliability, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of various interpolation methods across different datasets and individuals.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the linear mixed effects model (LMM) utilized several input parameters. The fixed effect variables included the number of samples from an individual, the time difference from the preceding sample and to the subsequent sample, and the logit transformation of the interpolation accuracy using the Bray-Curtis similarity score in the preceding and subsequent samples. Additionally, the random effect in the model was the individual.\n\nThe selection of these parameters was driven by the need to predict the logit product of the Bray-Curtis similarity score between the interpolation results and the real abundance. The inclusion of interpolation accuracy at adjacent time points implicitly incorporates information about microbiome stability. The significance of these parameters was assessed using the Wald test, which showed that interpolation accuracy in adjacent samples was significant across all methods. Conversely, sample size was found to be non-significant and was subsequently removed from downstream analyses.\n\nFor the generalized Lotka-Volterra (gLV) model, the parameters involved in the matrix F, which represents the rate of change in abundance for all taxa at every time point, were inferred using the maximum likelihood unconstrained ridge regression algorithm (MLRR) and LIMITS. The default parameters presented in the original papers were used for these algorithms. Due to the varying time differences in microbiome studies, the matrix F was normalized by dividing by the time difference between adjacent time points.\n\nIn summary, the model parameters were selected based on their relevance to predicting interpolation accuracy and microbiome stability, with statistical tests used to validate their significance. The gLV model parameters were inferred using established algorithms with default settings, adjusted for the specific characteristics of the microbiome data.",
  "optimization/features": "In the optimization process, several features were utilized as inputs for the linear mixed effects model (LMM). The fixed effect variables included the number of samples from each individual, the time difference from the preceding sample and to the subsequent sample, and the logit transformation of the interpolation accuracy using the Bray-Curtis similarity score in the preceding and subsequent samples. Additionally, the random effect in the model was the individual.\n\nFeature selection was implicitly performed by considering only the most relevant variables for the model. Specifically, the sample size was initially included but later removed from the model in downstream analyses because it was found to be not significant across any method. This decision was based on the results of the Wald test for the fixed effect variables, which showed that interpolation accuracy in adjacent samples was significant, while sample size was not.\n\nThe selection process ensured that only meaningful and significant features were retained, thereby focusing on variables that genuinely influenced the model's predictions. This approach helped in maintaining the model's simplicity and effectiveness, avoiding overfitting and ensuring that the model's performance was robust and generalizable.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed several interpolation methods to predict microbiome compositions at unsampled time points. The number of parameters in our models varied depending on the method used. For instance, methods like maximum likelihood unconstrained ridge regression (MLRR) and LIMITS, which rely on the generalized Lotka-Volterra model, involve estimating interaction parameters between taxa. Given the high dimensionality of microbiome data, the number of parameters can indeed be large compared to the number of training points, especially when considering the 30 most abundant taxa across all time points.\n\nTo address the risk of overfitting, we implemented cross-validation techniques. Specifically, we used a leave-one-out approach where we omitted one time point, interpolated its composition using the remaining samples, and evaluated the interpolation accuracy. This process was repeated multiple times with different sample sizes, allowing us to estimate the correlation between sample size and interpolation accuracy. Additionally, we compared the performance of different methods and found that some, like MLRR and spline, showed strong improvement with increasing sample size, indicating robustness against overfitting.\n\nConversely, to ensure that our models were not underfitting, we evaluated the performance of various interpolation methods, including na\u00efve approaches like the \"equal\" method, which assigns the same uniform composition to each sample. The consistent improvement in interpolation accuracy with more sophisticated methods, such as MLRR and spline, suggested that our models were capturing the underlying patterns in the data without being too simplistic.\n\nFurthermore, we fitted the data with a linear mixed effects model (LMM) to predict the logit product of the Bray-Curtis similarity score between the interpolation results and the real abundance. This model included fixed effects such as the time difference from the preceding and subsequent samples, and the interpolation accuracy in adjacent samples. The significance of these variables in the model, as indicated by the Wald test, provided additional confidence that our models were appropriately capturing the relevant temporal dynamics in the microbiome data.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed several regularization techniques to prevent overfitting. Specifically, we utilized the maximum likelihood unconstrained ridge regression algorithm (MLRR) suggested by Stein et al. and LIMITS, proposed by Fisher et al. Both of these methods incorporate regularization to handle the high dimensionality and sparsity of microbiome data, which are common challenges in such studies. The ridge regression component of MLRR adds a penalty term to the loss function, which helps to shrink the coefficients of less important features, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting. Similarly, LIMITS also includes regularization mechanisms to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data. By using these regularization techniques, we aimed to enhance the robustness and reliability of our interpolation methods for longitudinal microbiome data.",
  "optimization/config": "The hyper-parameter configurations and optimization parameters used in our study are reported within the main text and supplementary materials. Specifically, we detailed the use of a maximum likelihood unconstrained ridge regression algorithm (MLRR) and LIMITS, adhering to the default parameters presented in the original papers by Stein et al. and Fisher et al. These details ensure reproducibility and transparency in our methodology.\n\nThe model files and optimization schedules are not explicitly provided as standalone resources. However, the preprocessing steps and the specific algorithms employed are thoroughly described, allowing other researchers to replicate our work. The data sets utilized, including those from Caporaso et al., Poyet et al., and de Muinck and Trosvik, are referenced with clear instructions on how they were obtained and processed. This includes the use of QIIME2 for feature tables, dada2 for denoising, and specific plugins for phylogenetic tree construction and taxonomy classification.\n\nRegarding the availability and licensing of the configurations and parameters, they are presented within the academic publication, which is typically accessible under the terms of the journal's licensing agreement. This ensures that the methodological details are open for scrutiny and replication by the scientific community. However, specific model files or optimization schedules are not separately licensed or distributed.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is a linear mixed effects model (LMM) with a random intercept, which is inherently more interpretable than many black-box models. The transparency of this model stems from its structure, which includes both fixed and random effects.\n\nThe fixed effects in the model are clearly defined variables that include the number of samples from an individual, the time difference from the preceding and subsequent samples, and the logit transformation of the interpolation accuracy using the Bray-Curtis similarity score in adjacent samples. These variables are chosen based on their potential impact on the interpolation accuracy, and their inclusion in the model allows for a straightforward interpretation of their effects.\n\nThe random effect in the model is the individual, which accounts for the variability between different subjects. This random effect helps to mitigate the impact of fixed sample sizes within each individual, making the model more robust and interpretable in the context of longitudinal microbiome data.\n\nFurthermore, the model's performance metrics, such as the mean absolute error and Spearman correlation, provide additional insights into its reliability and accuracy. The mean absolute error being below 0.1 across all methods indicates that the model's predictions are close to the actual values. The high Spearman correlation between the expected and real interpolation accuracy suggests that the model captures the underlying patterns in the data effectively.\n\nIn summary, the linear mixed effects model used in this study is transparent and interpretable. The fixed effects provide clear insights into the factors influencing interpolation accuracy, while the random effect accounts for individual variability. The model's performance metrics further support its reliability and accuracy, making it a valuable tool for predicting interpolation accuracy in longitudinal microbiome studies.",
  "model/output": "The model employed in our study is a regression model, specifically a linear mixed effects model (LMM) with a random intercept. This model is designed to predict the logit product of the Bray-Curtis similarity score between the interpolation results and the real abundance. The fixed effect variables in the model include the number of samples from an individual, the time difference from the preceding and subsequent samples, and the logit transformation of the interpolation accuracy using the Bray-Curtis similarity score in the preceding and subsequent samples. The random effect is the individual.\n\nThe model's output is the predicted logit product of the Bray-Curtis similarity score, which indicates how similar the interpolated microbiome composition is to the actual composition. This similarity score is a measure of the model's accuracy in interpolating missing data points in microbiome time series.\n\nThe P-value calculations for the fixed effect variables using the Wald test showed that interpolation accuracy in adjacent samples is significant across all methods. This significance aligns with our findings regarding the autocorrelation in interpolation accuracy and the impact of the time interval between adjacent time points, particularly in methods that rely heavily on temporal relationships, such as Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN), splines, and the generalized Lotka-Volterra (gLV) model.\n\nSample size was found to be not significant in any method and was subsequently removed from the model in downstream analyses. This suggests that the number of samples does not substantially affect the interpolation accuracy in our model.\n\nThe model's performance was evaluated using various interpolation methods, including k-nearest neighbors (KNN), maximum likelihood unconstrained ridge regression (MLRR), splines, and DBN. Each method was assessed for its ability to accurately interpolate missing microbiome data points, with the results indicating varying levels of success depending on the method and the characteristics of the data set.",
  "model/duration": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "To evaluate the interpolation methods for predicting microbiome composition at unassayed time points, a leave-one-out cross-validation approach was employed. For each individual in the datasets, every available sample, except for those taken at the first and last time points, was systematically omitted. The interpolation methods were then used to infer the composition of the omitted sample based on all remaining samples. The accuracy of each method was quantified by comparing the inferred composition to the real composition using the Bray-Curtis similarity metric. This metric provided a measure of the degree of similarity between the predicted and actual microbiome compositions, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of each method's interpolation accuracy.\n\nThe evaluation process involved examining the performance of various interpolation methods across different datasets, individuals, time points, and taxa. This comprehensive analysis helped identify which methods generally performed better and under what conditions. For instance, the KNN method with an Epanechnikov kernel consistently showed the highest interpolation accuracy, particularly in adult datasets. Other methods, such as weighted average and cubic spline, also demonstrated good performance, although to a lesser extent. The evaluation highlighted the challenges posed by the unique characteristics of microbiome data, such as sparsity and high dimensionality, and the need for microbiome-specific method assessments.\n\nThe results indicated that while some methods, like KNN, were robust across various settings, others, such as gLV MSE and LIMITS, performed poorly. The analysis also revealed that interpolation accuracy varied significantly between adults and infants, with methods generally performing better in adult datasets due to the more stable microbiome composition in adults compared to the rapid changes observed in infants. Additionally, factors such as sample size and sampling frequency were found to influence interpolation accuracy, with larger sample sizes and more frequent sampling generally leading to better performance. This evaluation provided valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of different interpolation methods, guiding the selection of appropriate techniques for longitudinal microbiome data analysis.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed the Bray-Curtis similarity metric to evaluate the interpolation accuracy of various methods. This metric quantifies the degree of similarity between the inferred microbiome composition and the real composition, providing a clear measure of how well each method performs.\n\nWe reported the mean similarity scores for each method across different datasets, which allowed us to compare their overall performance. For instance, KNN with an Epanechnikov kernel exhibited the highest interpolation accuracy, with mean similarity scores of 0.875, 0.833, and 0.77 in the Caporaso et al., Poyet et al., and de Muinck and Trosvik datasets, respectively. This resulted in an overall mean similarity score of 0.8 across all datasets combined.\n\nAdditionally, we analyzed the distribution of Bray-Curtis similarity scores using a leave-one-out cross-validation approach. This involved systematically omitting each available sample (except for the first and last time points) and using the interpolation methods to infer the composition of the omitted sample. The transparency of the distribution's bars in our figures corresponds to the rank of the method's mean within each dataset, indicating how accurate each method is in comparison to others.\n\nWe also examined the variation in interpolation accuracy across individuals and datasets. This included assessing how different methods performed in adults versus infants, as well as how community diversity and other factors might influence interpolation accuracy. For example, we found that all methods, except for gLV MSE, performed substantially better in data obtained from adults compared to infants.\n\nFurthermore, we constructed a linear mixed-effects model to predict interpolation accuracy. The model's reliability was evaluated using the mean absolute error and Spearman correlation between the expected and real interpolation accuracy. The results showed a mean absolute error below 0.1 across all methods and a high Spearman correlation (>0.6), indicating good performance of the model.\n\nOverall, the set of metrics we used is representative of the literature, focusing on similarity measures and error distributions to provide a comprehensive evaluation of interpolation methods for longitudinal microbiome data.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we conducted a comprehensive comparison of various interpolation methods to predict microbiome composition at unassayed time points. We evaluated these methods using a leave-one-out cross-validation approach across multiple datasets, ensuring a robust benchmarking process.\n\nWe compared our methods against several publicly available techniques, including those based on generalized Lotka-Volterra (gLV) equations, machine learning algorithms, and statistical models. These methods were chosen for their relevance and previous use in similar studies. Specifically, we included gLV MSE, LIMITS, MLRR, KNN, spline, and dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) in both sparse and dense configurations. This allowed us to assess the performance of our methods against established and widely-used approaches.\n\nIn addition to these more complex methods, we also compared our results against simpler baselines. These included na\u00efve interpolation methods such as using the median abundance, average abundance, or the abundance at the previous time point as the predicted abundance for a missing sample. We also included a very basic \"null\" method that assigns equal abundance to all taxa, serving as a minimal benchmark.\n\nThe datasets used for this comparison were diverse, including data from adults and infants, ensuring that our methods were tested under various conditions. The datasets included samples from Caporaso et al., Poyet et al., and de Muinck and Trosvik, each with different sampling intervals and individual characteristics. This diversity allowed us to evaluate the generalizability and robustness of each method across different scenarios.\n\nOur evaluation metrics focused on the Bray-Curtis similarity score, which quantifies the similarity between the inferred and real microbiome compositions. This metric provided a clear and standardized way to compare the performance of different methods. We found that KNN consistently performed the best across all datasets, with mean similarity scores of 0.875, 0.833, and 0.77 in Caporaso et al., Poyet et al., and de Muinck and Trosvik datasets, respectively. Other methods like weighted average and spline also showed good performance, indicating their potential utility in microbiome interpolation.\n\nOverall, our comparison to both publicly available methods and simpler baselines provided a thorough evaluation of the interpolation techniques. This approach ensured that our findings are reliable and applicable across different datasets and conditions.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "In our study, we employed a linear mixed effects model (LMM) to evaluate the interpolation methods, which allowed us to assess the statistical significance of our findings. The model included fixed effects such as the time difference from preceding and subsequent samples, and the interpolation accuracy at adjacent time points. We used the Wald test to calculate p-values for these fixed effect variables, providing a measure of statistical significance. The results indicated that interpolation accuracy in adjacent samples was significant across all methods, suggesting that our findings are robust and not due to random chance.\n\nAdditionally, we reported the mean and standard deviation of the absolute error between the model's expected interpolation accuracy and the real interpolation accuracy across all time points. This information gives an idea of the variability and reliability of our results. The mean absolute error was below 0.1 across all methods, indicating that our model is a reliable tool for predicting interpolation accuracy.\n\nWe also calculated Spearman correlation coefficients to measure the relationship between the expected interpolation accuracy and the real interpolation accuracy. The correlations were high (>0.6 in all methods), further supporting the validity of our model and the statistical significance of our results.\n\nMoreover, we compared the performance of different interpolation methods using the Bray-Curtis similarity score, which measures the compositional similarity between the interpolated and real microbiome data. The results showed clear differences in performance between methods, with some methods consistently outperforming others. For instance, KNN with Epanechnikov kernel exhibited the highest interpolation accuracy in most settings, while methods like LIMITS and gLV MSE resulted in lower similarity scores.\n\nTo ensure the reliability of our findings, we also examined the variation in interpolation accuracy across individuals and datasets. We found that some individuals exhibited relatively good accuracy across all methods, while others showed poor accuracy. This variation was more pronounced in infants compared to adults, highlighting the challenges of interpolating microbiome data in this population.\n\nIn summary, our study provides a comprehensive evaluation of interpolation methods for longitudinal microbiome data, with a focus on statistical significance and reliability. The use of LMM, p-values, mean absolute error, and Spearman correlation coefficients allowed us to assess the performance of different methods confidently and claim that some methods are superior to others and baselines.",
