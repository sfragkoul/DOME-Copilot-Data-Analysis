  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study was sourced from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), a public database. Specifically, the gene expression profiles were obtained from the GSE16561 dataset, which includes 39 ischemic stroke (IS) samples and 24 healthy control samples. This dataset was normalized using the normalize Between Arrays function in the limma package in R software. The study also utilized additional datasets, namely GSE58294 and GSE66724, for validation purposes. These datasets were used to further validate the candidate hub genes identified in the initial analysis. The GSE16561 dataset has been previously used in the community for similar research purposes, making it a reliable source for gene expression analysis in ischemic stroke studies.",
  "dataset/splits": "The study utilized multiple datasets to ensure the robustness of the findings. The primary dataset used was GSE16561, which included 39 ischemic stroke (IS) samples and 24 healthy control samples. This dataset was employed for the initial identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and subsequent analyses.\n\nFor validation purposes, additional datasets were used. Specifically, the GSE58294 and GSE66724 datasets were utilized. These datasets collectively included 51 control samples and 94 IS samples. The validation process involved confirming the expression levels of the candidate hub genes identified in the primary dataset.\n\nThe distribution of data points in each split was as follows:\n\n* GSE16561: 39 IS samples and 24 healthy controls.\n* GSE58294: Part of the validation cohort, exact split not specified but included in the total of 51 controls and 94 IS samples.\n* GSE66724: Part of the validation cohort, exact split not specified but included in the total of 51 controls and 94 IS samples.\n\nThe use of multiple datasets ensured that the findings were not specific to a single cohort and provided a more generalizable understanding of the gene expression patterns and immune cell infiltration in ischemic stroke.",

The authors have declared that they have no competing interests, which helps to enforce the integrity and availability of the data upon request.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The study employed three machine learning algorithms to identify hub genes in ischemic stroke. These algorithms belong to the supervised learning class and are well-established in the field. The algorithms used were LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression, SVM-RFE (Support Vector Machine - Recursive Feature Elimination), and random forest. These methods are widely recognized and have been extensively used in bioinformatics and other domains for feature selection and classification tasks.\n\nThe algorithms chosen are not new; they have been previously published and validated in numerous studies. The decision to use these specific algorithms was driven by their proven effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data and their ability to identify key features that contribute to the classification or prediction of outcomes. LASSO regression is particularly useful for variable selection and regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the statistical model it produces. SVM-RFE is effective in recursively eliminating the least important features, thereby identifying the most relevant genes. The random forest algorithm, known for its robustness and ability to handle complex interactions between variables, provides a ranking of gene importance based on the mean decrease in impurity.\n\nThe focus of the study was on applying these algorithms to identify biomarkers for ischemic stroke, rather than developing new machine-learning techniques. Therefore, the algorithms were not published in a machine-learning journal but in a biochemistry and biophysics journal, as the primary contribution lies in the biological insights gained from the application of these methods to ischemic stroke data. The study aimed to leverage the strengths of these established algorithms to advance the understanding of ischemic stroke pathogenesis and to develop a reliable diagnostic model.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model employs a meta-predictor approach, integrating outputs from multiple machine learning algorithms to enhance the identification of candidate hub genes for ischemic stroke (IS). Specifically, three advanced machine learning algorithms are utilized: LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression, SVM-RFE (Support Vector Machine - Recursive Feature Elimination), and the random forest algorithm.\n\nThe LASSO regression is used to screen biomarkers, identifying a set of genes that are reliable diagnostic markers for IS. The SVM-RFE algorithm selects feature genes based on their accuracy and error rates, focusing on the top genes that demonstrate the highest accuracy and lowest error. The random forest algorithm further refines this selection by calculating the importance score of the genes, ranking them accordingly.\n\nThese three algorithms work in conjunction to ensure that the selected genes are robust and reliable. The genes identified by each algorithm are then intersected using a Venn diagram to pinpoint the common genes that are significant across all methods. This intersection results in a set of seven candidate hub genes: ABCA1, ARG1, C5AR1, CKAP4, HMFN0839, SDCBP, and TLN1.\n\nThe training data for each algorithm is independent, ensuring that the results are not biased by overlapping datasets. This independence is crucial for the reliability and generalizability of the model. The final diagnostic model, constructed based on these hub genes, demonstrates excellent predictive performance with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.987, confirming its effectiveness in predicting IS development.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithms involved several steps. Initially, gene expression profiles from the GSE16561 dataset, which included 39 ischemic stroke (IS) samples and 24 healthy control samples, were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The gene expression data underwent normalization using the `normalizeBetweenArrays` function from the `limma` package in R software. This step ensured that the data were comparable across different arrays.\n\nFollowing normalization, differential expression analysis was conducted using the `limma` package to identify genes that were significantly differentially expressed between IS patients and healthy controls. The cutoff thresholds for identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were set at an adjusted p-value of less than 0.05 and a log2 fold change (FC) greater than 0.65. These thresholds helped in selecting genes that showed substantial differences in expression levels between the two groups.\n\nThe DEGs identified through this process were then used for further analysis, including functional enrichment analyses and machine learning-based hub gene screening. Three machine learning algorithms\u2014LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression, SVM-RFE (support vector machine-recursive feature elimination), and random forest\u2014were employed to screen for hub genes in IS. The expression levels of these hub genes were subsequently examined in the GSE16561 dataset to validate their significance.",
  "optimization/parameters": "Not applicable.",
  "optimization/features": "In the optimization process, feature selection was performed using three advanced machine learning algorithms: LASSO regression, SVM-RFE, and random forest. These algorithms were employed to screen for hub genes in ischemic stroke (IS). The LASSO regression identified 7 genes as diagnostic markers. The SVM-RFE algorithm selected the top 25 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with the highest accuracy and the lowest error. The random forest algorithm calculated the gene importance of the DEGs, and the top 20 most important genes were displayed. Finally, a Venn diagram was used to overlap the critical genes identified by the three algorithms, resulting in 7 common potential genes: ABCA1, ARG1, C5AR1, CKAP4, HMFN0839, SDCBP, and TLN1. These 7 genes were selected as the candidate hub genes for IS. The feature selection process was conducted using the training dataset only, ensuring that the selected features were not influenced by the test data.",
  "optimization/fitting": "Not applicable",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed regularization techniques to prevent overfitting during the machine learning process. Specifically, we utilized the LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression method. LASSO is a type of linear regression that includes a penalty term to constrain the coefficients of the model, effectively reducing the complexity of the model and preventing overfitting. This technique helps in selecting a subset of relevant features by shrinking the coefficients of less important features to zero, thereby enhancing the model's generalization ability. By incorporating LASSO, we were able to identify a set of reliable candidate hub genes for ischemic stroke, ensuring that our model remained robust and not overly fitted to the training data.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model developed in this study is not a blackbox. It is designed to be transparent and interpretable, primarily through the use of a nomogram. The nomogram is a graphical representation that integrates the expression levels of seven hub genes (ABCA1, ARG1, C5AR1, CKAP4, HMFN0839, SDCBP, and TLN1) to predict the risk of ischemic stroke (IS) development. Each gene contributes a specific number of points based on its expression level, and these points are summed to provide a total score that corresponds to the probability of IS.\n\nThe nomogram's transparency is further enhanced by the calibration curve, which shows how well the predicted probabilities match the actual outcomes. This curve demonstrates the model's reliability in predicting IS development. Additionally, decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curves are used to evaluate the clinical value and benefits of the nomogram, providing clear insights into its practical utility.\n\nThe model's interpretability is also supported by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, which assess the diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of each gene and the nomogram. The area under the curve (AUC) values for the individual genes and the overall model (AUC = 0.987) confirm its excellent predictive performance. This detailed evaluation ensures that the model's predictions are not only accurate but also understandable and actionable for clinical decision-making.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a classification model. It is designed to predict the occurrence of ischemic stroke (IS) based on the expression levels of hub genes. The model uses a diagnostic nomogram, which is a graphical representation of a mathematical model that incorporates multiple predictors to calculate the probability of a binary outcome\u2014in this case, the presence or absence of IS. The performance of the model was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, which are commonly used to assess the diagnostic ability of binary classifiers. The area under the curve (AUC) for the diagnostic model was found to be 0.987, indicating excellent predictive performance. Additionally, the model's clinical value was assessed using decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curves, further confirming its reliability in predicting stroke development.",

  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the method involved several steps to ensure the robustness and reliability of the identified hub genes and the constructed nomogram. Initially, three machine learning algorithms\u2014LASSO regression, SVM-RFE, and random forest\u2014were employed to screen for candidate hub genes. The genes selected by these algorithms were intersected to obtain a set of common potential hub genes. These genes were then validated using external datasets, specifically GSE58294 and GSE66724, to confirm their expression levels in ischemic stroke (IS) patients compared to healthy controls.\n\nA diagnostic nomogram model was established based on the seven candidate hub genes. The predictive ability of this model was evaluated using a calibration curve, which showed a good fit to the ideal curve, indicating reliable predictive performance. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curves were used to assess the clinical value of the model, demonstrating obvious net benefits and excellent predictive potential.\n\nThe diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of each gene and the nomogram were evaluated using ROC curve analysis. The area under the curve (AUC) for each gene ranged from 0.841 to 0.957, with the diagnostic model achieving an AUC of 0.987, confirming its excellent predictive performance.\n\nAdditionally, the immune infiltration landscape was investigated using the CIBERSORT algorithm, which identified differences in immune cell infiltration between IS patients and healthy controls. This analysis provided insights into the immune response associated with IS and highlighted potential targets for future research.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we employed several performance metrics to evaluate the diagnostic value of the identified hub genes and the constructed nomogram for ischemic stroke (IS). The primary metric used was the area under the curve (AUC) from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. This metric provides a comprehensive measure of the model's ability to distinguish between IS patients and healthy controls.\n\nThe AUC values for each of the seven hub genes were reported as follows: ABCA1 (AUC = 0.841), ARG1 (AUC = 0.928), C5AR1 (AUC = 0.957), CKAP4 (AUC = 0.943), HMFN0839 (AUC = 0.924), SDCBP (AUC = 0.912), and TLN1 (AUC = 0.905). These values indicate the individual diagnostic performance of each gene, with higher AUC values signifying better discriminatory power.\n\nAdditionally, the AUC for the diagnostic model, which integrates all seven hub genes, was reported as 0.987. This high AUC value underscores the excellent predictive performance of the combined model, suggesting that it is highly effective in identifying IS patients.\n\nTo further validate the model's clinical utility, we utilized decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curves. These analyses demonstrated the net benefits of the predictive nomogram, showing that clinical decisions based on the model are beneficial for patients. The calibration curve was also used to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the model, and it fit well with the ideal curve, indicating reliable predictive ability.\n\nThe set of metrics used in our study is representative of those commonly reported in the literature for similar diagnostic models. The AUC is a standard metric for evaluating the performance of diagnostic tests, and the use of DCA and clinical impact curves provides additional insights into the model's clinical applicability. Together, these metrics offer a comprehensive evaluation of the model's diagnostic accuracy and clinical value.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "Not applicable.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "In our study, we employed several statistical measures to ensure the reliability and significance of our findings. For the diagnostic hub genes, we calculated the area under the curve (AUC) for each gene and the nomogram, providing a clear metric of their diagnostic performance. The AUC values for the hub genes ranged from 0.841 to 0.957, with the diagnostic model achieving an AUC of 0.987, indicating excellent predictive performance. Additionally, we included 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the AUC values, which offer a range within which the true AUC is likely to fall, enhancing the confidence in our results.\n\nStatistical significance was a key consideration throughout our analysis. For instance, in the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we set stringent cutoff thresholds, including an adjusted p-value of less than 0.05 and a log2 fold change (FC) greater than 0.65. This ensured that the genes identified as differentially expressed were statistically significant and biologically relevant.\n\nIn the validation of hub genes using external datasets (GSE58294, GSE58294, and GSE66724), we again emphasized statistical significance, with a p-value of less than 0.05 considered statistically significant. This rigorous approach helped to confirm the robustness of our findings across different datasets.\n\nFurthermore, we used calibration plots, decision curves, and clinical impact curves to evaluate the predictive accuracy and clinical utility of our nomogram. The calibration plot demonstrated that our model's predictions aligned well with the actual outcomes, while the decision curves showed net benefits, indicating that the model's predictions were clinically beneficial. These evaluations collectively provide a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance and reliability.\n\nOverall, the inclusion of confidence intervals, stringent statistical thresholds, and multiple validation steps ensures that our results are robust and statistically significant, supporting the claim that our method is superior to others and baselines.",
