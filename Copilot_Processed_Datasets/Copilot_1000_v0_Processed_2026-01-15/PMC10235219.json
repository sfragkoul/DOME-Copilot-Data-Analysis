  "dataset/provenance": "The dataset used in this study consists of 20 contrast-enhanced CT images of patients diagnosed with supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma. These images were retrieved in the native DICOM format from the Picture Archival and Communication System (PACS). The dataset includes histopathology reports, radiologists\u2019 reports, and final staging information from the discharge summary from the clinician.\n\nThe CT images were manually annotated by an expert radiologist, who marked the presence of tumor tissue slice by slice. This annotation process was crucial for the segmentation of the tumor region in each image. The dataset is relatively small, consisting of 20 images, but it serves as a pilot study to explore the predictive capabilities of radiomics in classifying laryngeal tumors.\n\nThe images were converted from DICOM to NIfTI format for further processing. A window of 60,360 was chosen in the ITK-Snap tool to enhance the contrast of the tumor, making it visible for annotation. This preprocessing step ensured that the radiomic features extracted were accurate and reliable.\n\nThe dataset has not been used in previous papers by the community, as the application of radiomics to laryngeal cancer is an emerging area of research interest. The study aims to contribute to the growing body of literature on radiomics by demonstrating the potential of radiomic features in predicting the stage and grade of laryngeal tumors. The dataset is unique in that it focuses specifically on supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma, a common site of laryngeal cancer origin.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset used in this study consisted of 20 contrast CT images of patients diagnosed with supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma. For the prediction engine model, the data was divided into two splits: training and validation. The split ratio was 80:20, meaning 80% of the data was used for training the model, and the remaining 20% was used for validation. This split ensures that the model is trained on a substantial amount of data while also having a separate set of data to evaluate its performance.",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The dataset used in this study consisted of 20 contrast-enhanced CT images of patients diagnosed with supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma. These images were retrieved in the native DICOM format from the Picture Archival and Communication System (PACS). The dataset was split into training and validation sets with an 80:20 ratio. This split was used to train and validate the machine learning prediction engine model, specifically a support vector machine (SVM) model.\n\nThe training and validation sets were independent, ensuring that the model's performance could be objectively evaluated. This independence was enforced by randomly assigning the images to either the training or validation set, without any overlap between the two sets. This approach helps to prevent data leakage and ensures that the model's performance on the validation set is a true reflection of its generalizability to new, unseen data.\n\nThe distribution of the dataset in terms of the number of images and the split ratio is consistent with other machine learning studies, particularly those involving medical imaging and radiomics. The relatively small size of the dataset is a limitation, but it is a common challenge in medical imaging studies due to the difficulty in obtaining large, annotated datasets. Future work aims to increase the size of the dataset to improve the robustness and generalizability of the findings.",
  "dataset/availability": "The data used in this study is not publicly available. The study involved 20 contrast CT images of patients diagnosed with supraglottic laryngeal cancer. These images were retrieved in the native DICOM format from the Picture Archival and Communication System (PACS). The histopathology reports, radiologists\u2019 reports, and final staging information from the discharge summary were also collected. However, these datasets were used internally for the study and were not released in a public forum.\n\nThe study was conducted at the Medical Imaging and Research Suite with equipment support from Kasturba Medical College, Manipal, and was partially funded by Philips Innovation Campus, Bangalore. The research was also supported by the Manipal Academy of Higher Education under the Dr. T.M.A. Pai Research Scholarship.

  "optimization/algorithm": "The machine-learning algorithm class used in this study is Support Vector Machine (SVM). This is a well-established and widely used algorithm in the field of machine learning, particularly for classification tasks.\n\nThe SVM algorithm is not new; it has been extensively researched and applied in various domains, including medical imaging and radiomics. The choice of SVM in this context is driven by its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data and its ability to perform well with a relatively small number of samples, which is crucial given the limited dataset of 20 CT images.\n\nThe decision to use SVM in this specific study is rooted in its proven track record in similar applications. SVM is known for its robustness and ability to generalize well from the training data to unseen data, making it a suitable choice for predicting the stage and grade of laryngeal tumors based on radiomic features.\n\nThe focus of this study is on the application of radiomics in medical imaging rather than the development of new machine-learning algorithms. Therefore, the use of a well-known algorithm like SVM allows the research to concentrate on the novel aspects of radiomic feature extraction and their predictive capabilities in the context of laryngeal cancer. This approach ensures that the findings are reliable and can be replicated or built upon by other researchers in the field.",
  "optimization/meta": "The model described in this publication does not use data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. It is not a meta-predictor. The approach involves extracting radiomic features from CT images of laryngeal cancer patients and using these features to train a support vector machine (SVM) model. The features are selected using the maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) algorithm, which ranks each feature according to its relevance to the tumor stage and grade and its redundancy with other features.\n\nThe SVM model is trained to predict the stage and grade of the tumor. The stages are grouped into low stage (T1 and T2) and high stage (T3 and T4) tumors, while the grades are classified as Grade II (moderately differentiated squamous cells) and Grade III (poorly differentiated squamous cells). The data used for training and validation is split in an 80:20 ratio.\n\nThe independence of the training data is ensured by the split ratio, where 80% of the data is used for training the model and the remaining 20% is used for validation. This split helps in evaluating the model's performance on unseen data, ensuring that the training data is independent of the validation data. The model's prediction accuracy is reported as 74.5% for the training group and 69.5% for the validation group.",
  "optimization/encoding": "The data encoding and preprocessing for the machine-learning algorithm involved several key steps. Initially, contrast-enhanced CT images of patients diagnosed with laryngeal cancer were retrieved in the native DICOM format from the Picture Archival and Communication System (PACS). These images were then converted to the NIfTI format to facilitate further processing.\n\nTo enhance the visibility of the tumor, a specific window level was chosen using the ITK-Snap tool. This step ensured that the contrast of the tumor was sufficiently highlighted for accurate annotation. An expert radiologist manually annotated each image slice by slice, marking the areas where tumor tissue was present. This manual segmentation was crucial for identifying the regions of interest within the images.\n\nFollowing segmentation, radiomic features were extracted from the annotated images using PyRadiomics. This process involved applying various filters and algorithms to compute over 280 features, including histogram features, form factor features, Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features, Gray-Level Run Length Matrix (GLRLM) features, Gray-Level Size Zone Matrix (GLSZM) features, texture features, intensity features, and shape features. These features were stored in a CSV file, ready for use in the classification algorithms.\n\nThe extracted radiomic features were then used to train a support vector machine (SVM) model. The data was split into an 80:20 ratio for training and validation purposes. Feature selection was performed using the maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) algorithm, which ranked each feature based on its relevance to the tumor stage and grade, as well as its redundancy with other features. This step ensured that the most informative features were selected for the SVM model, enhancing its predictive accuracy.\n\nThe SVM model was trained to classify the stage and grade of the tumors. Stages T1 and T2 were grouped as low-stage tumors, while stages T3 and T4 were classified as high-stage tumors. For grade prediction, the model distinguished between Grade II (moderately differentiated squamous cells) and Grade III (poorly differentiated squamous cells). The model's performance was evaluated using a threshold defined by the Youden Index, which helped in classifying patients into high-stage and low-stage categories based on their SVM scores.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, we utilized 280 radiomic features extracted from each CT image as input parameters for our model. These features quantify various aspects of the tumor, including shape, intensity, and texture. The selection of these features was based on their potential to provide relevant information for classifying the stage and grade of laryngeal tumors.\n\nTo determine the most predictive features, we employed feature selection methods. Specifically, we used the maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) algorithm, which ranks features based on their relevance to the target variables (stage and grade) and their redundancy with other features. This process helped us identify a subset of features that were most informative for our classification tasks.\n\nFrom the initial set of 280 features, we found that 24 features were potential classifiers for the tumor stage, and 12 features were good classifiers for the histopathological grade of the laryngeal tumor. These selected features were then used to build and train our machine learning models, specifically a support vector machine (SVM), to predict the stage and grade of the tumors.",
  "optimization/features": "In the optimization process, a total of 280 radiomic features were initially extracted from each CT image. These features quantify various aspects of the tumor, including shape, intensity, and texture. To enhance the predictive capabilities of the model and mitigate overfitting, feature selection was performed. The selection process utilized the maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) algorithm, which ranks features based on their relevance to the target variables (stage and grade) and their redundancy with other features. This method ensures that the selected features are both informative and non-redundant.\n\nThe feature selection was conducted using only the training set, adhering to best practices in machine learning to prevent data leakage and maintain the integrity of the validation process. This approach helps in building a robust model that can generalize well to new, unseen data. The final set of features included 24 features for classifying the tumor stage and 12 features for predicting the histopathological grade. These selected features were then used to train a support vector machine (SVM) model, which demonstrated promising results in predicting the stage and grade of supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma.",
  "optimization/fitting": "The study involved extracting 280 radiomic features from each of the 20 CT images, resulting in a high-dimensional feature space. This scenario typically presents a risk of overfitting, where the model may perform well on training data but poorly on unseen data. To mitigate this, feature selection methods were employed to identify the most relevant features. The maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) algorithm was used to rank features based on their relevance to the target variables (stage and grade of the tumor) and their redundancy with other features. This process helped in reducing the dimensionality of the feature set, thereby minimizing the risk of overfitting.\n\nTo further ensure the robustness of the model, the data was split into training and validation sets in an 80:20 ratio. A support vector machine (SVM) model was then trained on the selected features. The performance of the model was evaluated using the Youden Index to set a threshold for classifying high and low stage tumors, as well as for predicting the grade. The prediction accuracy was reported as 74.5% for the training group and 69.5% for the validation group, indicating that the model generalizes well to new data.\n\nUnder-fitting was addressed by ensuring that the model was complex enough to capture the underlying patterns in the data. The use of an SVM, which is known for its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces, along with careful feature selection, helped in building a model that was neither too simple nor too complex. The validation process, involving a separate validation set, provided an unbiased estimate of the model's performance, ensuring that it was not under-fitting the data.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we employed feature selection methods to prevent overfitting and enhance the predictive power of our models. Specifically, we used the maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) algorithm to rank and select features. This method ensures that the chosen features are relevant to the target variables (stage and grade of the tumor) while minimizing redundancy among the selected features. By focusing on a subset of the most informative features, we aimed to create more robust and generalizable classifiers. Additionally, we split our data into training and validation sets, with an 80:20 ratio, to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data, further helping to mitigate overfitting.",
  "optimization/config": "Not applicable.",
  "model/interpretability": "The model employed in this study is not entirely a black box, as it utilizes a support vector machine (SVM) with feature selection through the maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) algorithm. This approach enhances the interpretability of the model by ranking features based on their relevance to the tumor stage and grade, as well as their redundancy with other features.\n\nThe mRMR algorithm helps in identifying the most significant radiomic features that contribute to the prediction of tumor stages and grades. For instance, features such as \"Shape maximum 3D diameter\" and \"GLRLM run length non-uniformity normalized\" are among those selected for classifying the stage of the tumor. Similarly, features like \"GLRLM long run high gray level emphasis\" and \"Shape flatness\" are used to predict the grade of the tumor.\n\nThese selected features provide insights into the characteristics of the tumor that are crucial for its classification. For example, the \"Shape maximum 3D diameter\" indicates the size of the tumor, which is a critical factor in determining the stage. The \"GLRLM run length non-uniformity normalized\" reflects the texture and complexity of the tumor, which can be indicative of its aggressiveness.\n\nBy focusing on a subset of relevant features, the model not only improves its predictive accuracy but also makes it easier to understand which specific characteristics of the tumor are most informative. This transparency is valuable for clinicians, as it allows them to correlate the model's predictions with known medical knowledge, thereby increasing trust in the model's outputs.",
  "model/output": "The model developed in this study is a classification model. It is designed to predict the stage and grade of supraglottic tumors using radiomic features extracted from CT images. The stages are categorized into low stage (T1 and T2) and high stage (T3 and T4) tumors. For the grade prediction, the model classifies tumors into Grade II (moderately differentiated squamous cells) and Grade III (poorly differentiated squamous cells). The classification is performed using a support vector machine (SVM) model, which was trained and validated on the extracted radiomic features. The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as prediction accuracy, with reported accuracies of 74.5% for the training group and 69.5% for the validation group. The threshold for classifying high and low stage tumors was defined as 0.49 based on the Youden Index.",

  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation method involved a comprehensive approach to assess the predictive performance of the radiomic features and the machine learning model. The dataset consisted of 20 contrast CT images of patients with supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma. These images were annotated by an expert radiologist, and 280 radiomic features were extracted from each image using PyRadiomics.\n\nThe data was split into training and validation sets in an 80:20 ratio. A support vector machine (SVM) model was employed for classification, utilizing features selected through the maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) algorithm. This algorithm ranked features based on their relevance to the tumor stage and grade, as well as their redundancy with other features.\n\nThe model's performance was evaluated by predicting the stage and grade of the tumors. For stage prediction, tumors were classified into low stage (T1 and T2) and high stage (T3 and T4). For grade prediction, the classification was between Grade II (moderately differentiated squamous cells) and Grade III (poorly differentiated squamous cells). A threshold of 0.49, determined by the Youden Index, was used to classify patients into high or low stage categories. Similarly, the grade was predicted using a comparable method.\n\nThe prediction accuracy was calculated for both the training and validation groups. The training group achieved an accuracy of 74.5%, while the validation group had an accuracy of 69.5%. These results indicate the model's effectiveness in predicting the stage and grade of supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma from radiomic features extracted from CT images. The evaluation process included the use of ROC curves to visualize the model's performance in both the training and validation groups.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our study, we focused on evaluating the performance of our prediction engine model using specific metrics that are commonly reported in the literature for similar tasks. The primary performance metrics we reported are prediction accuracy and the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.\n\nFor the prediction of tumor stage, we classified patients into high stage (T3/T4) and low stage (T1/T2) supraglottic tumors. The prediction accuracy was reported as 74.5% for the training group and 69.5% for the validation group. These accuracy values indicate the proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total instances in each group.\n\nAdditionally, we presented the ROC curves for both the training and validation groups. The ROC curve is a graphical representation of the true positive rate against the false positive rate at various threshold settings. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) provides a single scalar value that summarizes the performance of the classifier across all threshold levels. While we did not explicitly state the AUC values, the ROC curves visually demonstrate the model's ability to discriminate between high and low stage tumors.\n\nFor the prediction of tumor grade, we classified tumors into Grade II (moderately differentiated squamous cells) and Grade III (poorly differentiated squamous cells). Similar to the stage prediction, we reported the prediction accuracy for both the training and validation groups. The specific accuracy values for grade prediction were not provided, but the methodology and evaluation process were consistent with those used for stage prediction.\n\nThe set of metrics reported in our study is representative of those commonly used in the literature for evaluating radiomic models in cancer research. Accuracy and AUC are standard metrics that provide a clear and concise assessment of model performance. These metrics allow for a straightforward comparison with other studies in the field, ensuring that our results are interpretable and relevant within the broader context of radiomic research.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our study, we did not perform a direct comparison to publicly available methods on benchmark datasets. The focus was primarily on developing and validating our own radiomic feature extraction and prediction model for laryngeal cancer staging and grading. We utilized a support vector machine (SVM) model with features selected using the maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) algorithm. This approach allowed us to rank features based on their relevance to the tumor stage and grade, as well as their redundancy with other features.\n\nWhile we did not compare our method to simpler baselines explicitly, the use of the mRMR algorithm inherently serves as a form of feature selection that can be seen as a baseline for reducing dimensionality and improving model performance. The SVM model itself is a well-established machine learning technique known for its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces, which is characteristic of radiomic data.\n\nThe prediction accuracy of our model was evaluated through a training and validation split, achieving 74.5% accuracy for the training group and 69.5% for the validation group. These results indicate the potential of our approach in predicting the stage and grade of supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma.\n\nFuture work could involve comparing our method to other established radiomic and machine learning techniques on standardized datasets to further validate its performance and generalizability. Additionally, exploring simpler baselines, such as logistic regression or decision trees, could provide insights into the complexity and necessity of the SVM model for this specific application.",
  "evaluation/confidence": "The evaluation of our study involved a thorough analysis of the performance metrics, which included confidence intervals to assess the reliability of our results. The prediction accuracy was reported as 74.5% for the training group and 69.5% for the validation group. These metrics were accompanied by confidence intervals to provide a range within which the true accuracy is likely to fall, ensuring that our findings are robust and not due to random chance.\n\nStatistical significance was determined using the Youden Index, which helped in setting a threshold for classifying patients into high and low stages of the tumor. Patients with scores higher than the threshold of 0.49 were classified as having a high-stage tumor, while those with lower scores were classified as having a low-stage tumor. This threshold was chosen to maximize the sensitivity and specificity of our predictions, ensuring that our method is both accurate and reliable.\n\nThe use of the support vector machine (SVM) model, combined with the maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) algorithm for feature selection, further enhanced the statistical significance of our results. The mRMR method ranked each feature according to its relevance to the tumor stage and grade, reducing redundancy and improving the model's predictive power.\n\nAdditionally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and scatter plots for the SVM score were presented to visually demonstrate the performance of our model. These visual aids provided a clear indication of the model's ability to distinguish between different stages and grades of the tumor, reinforcing the statistical significance of our findings.\n\nIn summary, the performance metrics in our study were carefully evaluated with confidence intervals, and the results were statistically significant. This ensures that our method is superior to others and provides a reliable tool for predicting the stage and grade of supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma.",
