  "dataset/provenance": "The datasets used in this study are sourced from reputable platforms and have been utilized in previous research and by the community. The Framingham dataset, comprising 4240 observations with 16 variables, was obtained from Kaggle. This dataset is well-known and has been used extensively in studies related to heart disease prediction. It contains a significant class imbalance, with 3596 observations in the majority class (negative) and 644 in the minority class (positive).\n\nAnother dataset used is the Breast Cancer dataset from the UCI Repository. This dataset includes 799 observations and 36 variables. It is widely recognized and has been employed in numerous studies for cancer prediction and classification tasks. The dataset provides comprehensive information necessary for predicting cancer outcomes.\n\nAdditionally, the COVID-19 dataset, initially made available by Johns Hopkins University, was collected from reliable sources such as the World Health Organization (WHO). This dataset has been crucial for research on forecasting COVID-19 cases and understanding the spread of the virus. It includes detailed information on COVID-19 cases, which is essential for developing accurate predictive models.",
  "dataset/splits": "The dataset was divided into three distinct groups. The first group is the training set, which is used to train the models. The second group is the validation set, which is used to tune the model's hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. The third group is the test set, which is used to evaluate the final performance of the model.\n\nThe training set was used for 1530 iterations. During this process, the first sub-model was extracted after 765 iterations, and the second sub-model was extracted after the training set was completed. The output of these sub-models was then combined with the results of logistic regression to create a generalized and highly accurate model.\n\nThe specific number of data points in each split is not provided, but the dataset used for this process was the Framingham dataset, which comprises 4240 observations. Out of these, 3596 are in the majority class (negative) and 644 are in the minority class (positive).",
  "dataset/redundancy": "The datasets used in this study were split into three distinct groups: the training set, the validation set, and the test set. This division is crucial for ensuring that the models are trained, validated, and tested independently, thereby avoiding data leakage and ensuring robust performance evaluation.\n\nThe training set is used to train the models, where the parameters are adjusted to minimize the error on this subset. The validation set is employed to tune hyperparameters and select the best model configuration. Finally, the test set is used to evaluate the final model's performance on unseen data, providing an unbiased estimate of its generalization capability.\n\nTo enforce the independence of these sets, standard practices were followed. The datasets were randomly shuffled before splitting to ensure that the distribution of classes and features is similar across all subsets. This randomization helps in maintaining the representativeness of each set, making the evaluation more reliable.\n\nThe distribution of the datasets used in this study compares favorably with previously published machine learning datasets. For instance, the Framingham dataset, which comprises 4240 observations with 3596 in the majority class and 644 in the minority class, is representative of imbalanced datasets commonly encountered in healthcare. Similarly, the Breast Cancer dataset from the UCI Repository and the COVID-19 dataset from Kaggle exhibit typical imbalances and feature distributions seen in real-world applications.\n\nBy adhering to these splitting and validation strategies, the study ensures that the results are robust and generalizable, aligning with best practices in machine learning and data science.",
  "dataset/availability": "The datasets utilized in this study are publicly available, ensuring transparency and reproducibility. The Framingham dataset, which comprises 16 variables and 4240 observations, can be accessed from Kaggle. This dataset is particularly notable for its imbalance, with 3596 observations in the majority class and 644 in the minority class. The Breast Cancer dataset, sourced from the UCI Repository, includes 36 variables and 799 observations, providing comprehensive information for cancer prediction. Additionally, the COVID-19 dataset, initially made available by Johns Hopkins University, is accessible on Kaggle. This dataset was collected from reliable sources such as the World Health Organization.\n\nThese datasets are freely available to the public, allowing other researchers to verify and build upon the findings presented in this study. The availability of these datasets in public forums ensures that the methods and results can be independently validated, fostering a collaborative and transparent research environment. The datasets are shared under licenses that permit their use for research purposes, adhering to ethical and legal standards.",
  "optimization/algorithm": "The optimization algorithm discussed in this subsection primarily revolves around the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), both of which are well-established classes of machine-learning algorithms. These networks are utilized for feature extraction and classification tasks, respectively.\n\nThe specific models mentioned, such as the stacked CNN and stacked RNN, are not entirely new but represent refined and optimized versions of existing architectures. The stacked CNN, for instance, incorporates a meta-learner to enhance the model's ability to learn non-linear discriminative features and semantic representations at various levels of abstraction. Similarly, the stacked RNN is designed for time-series data, leveraging multiple RNN layers to improve performance.\n\nThe decision to publish these optimizations in a scientific journal rather than a machine-learning-specific journal can be attributed to the interdisciplinary nature of the research. The models are applied to real-world problems such as disease prediction, stock return prediction, and handling imbalanced datasets, which are of interest to a broader scientific community. This interdisciplinary approach allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of the models' practical applications and their impact on various fields.\n\nAdditionally, the focus on addressing class imbalance through techniques like Distance-based SMOTE (D-SMOTE) and Bi-phasic SMOTE (BP-SMOTE) highlights the practical challenges faced in real-world datasets. These techniques are integrated into the optimization process to improve the models' performance on imbalanced data, making the research relevant to a wide range of scientific disciplines.",
  "optimization/meta": "The proposed model employs a stacking ensemble framework, which indeed uses data from other machine-learning algorithms as input. This approach involves combining multiple classifiers to create a more robust and accurate predictive model.\n\nThe stacking ensemble framework integrates three primary classifiers: Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Neural Network. These classifiers operate at the base level, generating predictions that are then used as input features for a meta-learner. In the case of the stacked CNN model, a simple CNN serves as the meta-learner, while for the stacked RNN model, a simple RNN fulfills this role.\n\nThe training process ensures that the data used for training the base models is independent of the data used for training the meta-learner. The dataset is divided into three distinct groups: the training set, the validation set, and the test set. The base models are trained on the training set, and their predictions are used to train the meta-learner. This separation guarantees that the meta-learner learns to make accurate predictions based on the outputs of the base models without any data leakage.\n\nThe stacking approach involves several steps. First, the data is pre-processed, and missing values are imputed. The dataset is then split into training and test sets, with the training set comprising 70% of the data. Base models are fitted on the training set, and predictions are made on the validation set. This process is repeated for each base model, resulting in a stack of predictions. These predictions are then used as features to build the meta-learner, which is ultimately used for final predictions on the test set. This method enhances the overall accuracy of the model by leveraging the strengths of multiple classifiers.",
  "optimization/encoding": "In our study, data encoding and preprocessing were crucial steps to ensure the effectiveness of the machine-learning algorithms employed. For the Framingham dataset, which comprises 16 variables and 4240 observations, we first addressed the class imbalance issue. This dataset has 3596 observations in the majority class (negative) and 644 in the minority class (positive). To handle this imbalance, we implemented modified versions of the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), specifically Distance-based SMOTE (D-SMOTE) and Bi-phasic SMOTE (BP-SMOTE). These techniques helped in generating synthetic samples to balance the dataset, thereby improving the reliability of the results.\n\nFor the Breast Cancer dataset from the UCI Repository, which includes 36 variables and 799 observations, we ensured that the data was preprocessed to provide the necessary information for accurate cancer prediction. This involved cleaning the data, handling missing values, and normalizing the features to ensure that the machine-learning models could learn effectively from the dataset.\n\nThe COVID-19 dataset, initially made available by John Hopkins University, was collected from reliable sources such as the World Health Organization. This dataset was used for time-series analysis and required specific preprocessing steps to handle the temporal nature of the data. We divided the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the performance of our models accurately.\n\nIn addition to these datasets, we also utilized other datasets for various experiments. For instance, the Wisconsin Hospital data of Breast Cancer study was used for the Stacked CNN model, and the Novel Coronavirus 2019 dataset was used for the Stacked RNN model. Each dataset underwent similar preprocessing steps, including data cleaning, normalization, and handling class imbalances where necessary.\n\nOverall, the preprocessing steps involved ensuring that the data was clean, balanced, and normalized, which are essential for the effective training and evaluation of machine-learning models. These steps were integral to achieving high accuracy and reliability in our predictions.",
  "optimization/parameters": "In our study, the number of parameters used in the model varies depending on the specific architecture and technique employed. For instance, in the Stacked CNN model, the parameters are determined by the architecture of the convolutional neural networks and the meta-learner. The model is trained for 1530 iterations, with sub-models extracted at different stages to ensure optimal learning. Similarly, the Stacked RNN model for time-series data involves multiple RNN layers, each contributing to the overall parameter count.\n\nThe selection of parameters was guided by the need for the models to learn non-linear discriminative features and semantic representations at different levels of abstraction. For the Stacked CNN, class weights were assigned during training to address class imbalance, with specific ratios set for different classes. This approach helps the model to better understand and differentiate between classes.\n\nIn the case of the Distance-based SMOTE (D-SMOTE) and Bi-phasic SMOTE (BP-SMOTE) techniques, the parameters are influenced by the synthetic sample generation process. D-SMOTE generates new synthetic samples based on the distance from the class centroid, using a random number generator to create these samples. BP-SMOTE, on the other hand, involves two phases: the first phase uses the original SMOTE to maximize minority cases, and the second phase involves instance selection to choose representative instances for the final training dataset.\n\nThe choice of parameters was also informed by the performance evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curve. For example, the Random Forest classifier showed high values for these metrics when combined with D-SMOTE and BP-SMOTE, indicating the effectiveness of the parameter selection process. The accuracy obtained for BP-SMOTE was higher than that for D-SMOTE and SMOTE, demonstrating the significance of the parameter choices in improving model performance.",
  "optimization/features": "In the optimization process, the input features varied depending on the dataset used. For the Framingham dataset, 16 features were utilized. This dataset was obtained from Kaggle and comprises 4240 observations, with a significant class imbalance. The breast cancer dataset, sourced from the UCI Repository, includes 36 features and 799 observations. This dataset is crucial for predicting cancer outcomes. Additionally, COVID-19 data, initially made available by John Hopkins University, was collected from reliable sources like the World Health Organization. The specific number of features in the COVID-19 dataset is not explicitly mentioned, but it is used for classification tasks involving COVID-19, Pneumonia, and Normal classes.\n\nFeature selection was not explicitly detailed in the provided information. However, the use of class weights during training suggests an awareness of class imbalance, which might indirectly influence feature importance. The datasets were split into training, validation, and test sets, ensuring that the training set was used for model development and feature importance assessment. This approach helps in maintaining the integrity of the validation and test sets, preventing data leakage and ensuring robust model evaluation.",
  "optimization/fitting": "In our study, we employed several techniques to address the challenges of overfitting and underfitting, particularly given the imbalanced nature of our datasets.\n\nTo mitigate overfitting, we utilized a stacking ensemble framework that combines multiple classifiers, including Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Neural Network. This approach leverages the strengths of different models to create a more robust and generalized prediction model. Additionally, we implemented techniques such as tenfold cross-validation and repeated random sub-sampling to ensure that each observation is used exactly once for validation. This method helps in reducing overfitting by providing a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance.\n\nFor the convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) models, we incorporated regularization techniques like dropout and batch normalization. These methods help in preventing the model from becoming too complex and overfitting the training data. Specifically, dropout randomly sets a fraction of input units to zero at each update during training time, which helps in preventing overfitting. Batch normalization normalizes the inputs of each layer, which stabilizes and accelerates the training process.\n\nTo address underfitting, we ensured that our models were sufficiently complex to capture the underlying patterns in the data. For instance, in the CNN model, we used multiple convolutional layers to extract features at different levels of abstraction. Similarly, in the RNN model, we stacked multiple RNN layers to capture temporal dependencies in the data. Furthermore, we used techniques like synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE) and its variants, such as Distance-based SMOTE (D-SMOTE) and Bi-phasic SMOTE (BP-SMOTE), to balance the dataset. These techniques help in generating synthetic samples for the minority class, which improves the model's ability to learn from the imbalanced data.\n\nIn summary, our approach involved using ensemble methods, regularization techniques, and data augmentation strategies to balance the trade-off between overfitting and underfitting. These methods collectively ensure that our models generalize well to unseen data while capturing the essential patterns in the training data.",
  "optimization/regularization": "In our study, we implemented several regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and enhance the generalization of our models. One key modification involved replacing the switchable normalization method with general batch normalization in the convolution layer. This adjustment helped stabilize the training process and improved the model's performance.\n\nAdditionally, we employed targeted dropout, a recent regularization technology, in all three fully connected layers of the final three fully connected layers of the model. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent the model from becoming too reliant on any single neuron and thus reduces overfitting.\n\nFor the stacking ensemble framework, we used logistic regression as a meta-learner to combine the predictions from different sub-models. This approach helps in creating a more robust and generalized model by leveraging the strengths of multiple models.\n\nFurthermore, we addressed class imbalance by assigning class weights during the training phase. This technique allows the model to better understand and focus on the minority classes, thereby improving the overall accuracy and reliability of the predictions.\n\nIn summary, our regularization methods included batch normalization, targeted dropout, and class weighting, all of which contributed to mitigating overfitting and enhancing the model's performance.",
  "optimization/config": "Not enough information is available.",
  "model/interpretability": "The models discussed in this publication, specifically the Stacked CNN and Stacked RNN, are primarily designed for high accuracy and reliability in their predictions. However, these models are not inherently transparent and can be considered black-box models. This is because they involve complex architectures with multiple layers and non-linear transformations, making it challenging to interpret the internal workings and decision-making processes directly.\n\nThe Stacked CNN, for instance, uses convolutional layers to extract features at different levels of abstraction, which are then combined using a meta-learner, typically a simple CNN or logistic regression. While the final predictions are highly accurate, the intermediate steps and the specific features that contribute to these predictions are not easily interpretable.\n\nSimilarly, the Stacked RNN is designed for time-series data and involves multiple recurrent layers. The cell states and outputs at each layer are influenced by both the current input and the previous states, making the model's behavior over time complex and difficult to interpret.\n\nTo address the interpretability issue, techniques such as class weighting and ensemble methods are employed. Class weights are assigned during training to help the model better understand the classes, particularly in imbalanced datasets. This approach ensures that the model does not overly favor the majority class, making the predictions more balanced and potentially more interpretable in terms of class distribution.\n\nEnsemble methods, such as stacking, combine the predictions of multiple models to improve overall accuracy. While this enhances performance, it also adds layers of complexity, making it harder to trace back the contributions of individual models to the final prediction.\n\nIn summary, while the Stacked CNN and Stacked RNN models are powerful tools for accurate predictions, they are not transparent. Their complex architectures and the use of ensemble methods make them black-box models, where the internal decision-making processes are not easily interpretable. Techniques like class weighting help in balancing the predictions, but they do not significantly improve the transparency of the models.",
  "model/output": "The model discussed in this publication is primarily focused on classification tasks. Various models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), have been employed for feature extraction and classification. For instance, a shallow custom CNN was developed that outperformed pre-trained models in classification accuracy, achieving 100% accuracy and an AUC of 1. Additionally, stacked ensemble models, such as Stacked CNN and Stacked RNN, were proposed for improved classification performance. These models were used in applications like disease prediction, including breast cancer and heart disease, as well as in handling imbalanced datasets. The evaluation metrics provided, such as accuracy, F1-score, and kappa score, further indicate that the models are designed for classification tasks.",
  "model/duration": "The execution time of the proposed models varied depending on the specific architecture and dataset used. For instance, the Stacked CNN model was trained for 1530 iterations, with sub-model#1 extracted after 765 iterations and sub-model#2 after the training set was completed. This model was designed to be trained more quickly than pre-trained models, utilizing a small number of trainable parameters. The Stacked RNN model, on the other hand, was developed for time-series data and involved stacking multiple RNNs to form a more complex architecture. The exact execution time for each model was not explicitly stated, but the Stacked CNN model's training process was described as efficient, suggesting relatively quick execution times compared to traditional methods. Additionally, the use of techniques like general batch normalization and targeted dropout in the convolution layers further optimized the training process, contributing to reduced execution times.",
  "model/availability": "Not enough information is available.",
  "evaluation/method": "The evaluation of the proposed methods involved several techniques to ensure robust and accurate performance metrics. For the breast cancer dataset, tenfold cross-validation was employed to train and test individual classifiers such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and Na\u00efve Bayes. This approach helps in accurate prediction and mitigates issues like overfitting. Repeated random sub-sampling was used for both training and validation, ensuring that each observation was used exactly once for validation.\n\nTo address class imbalance in datasets, techniques like Oversampling, Undersampling, and hybrid sampling were applied. Among these, Oversampling, particularly using SMOTE, was found to be more effective. Two modified versions of SMOTE, Distance-based SMOTE (D-SMOTE) and Bi-phasic SMOTE (BP-SMOTE), were proposed and evaluated with various classifiers, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Boosting, and Random Forest. The performance was assessed using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and ROC Curve.\n\nThe evaluation also included a comparison of different ensemble methods like Voting, Bagging, Boosting, Random Forest, and Stacking. Stacking emerged as the most accurate method, achieving up to 97% accuracy. This was demonstrated through a stacked ensemble of classifiers, where the stacking approach provided a synergistic effect, enhancing the accuracy significantly.\n\nFor time-series forecasting using COVID-19 data, a Stacked RNN model was developed and compared with other models like Simple RNN, LSTM, and a combination of RNN and LSTM. The Stacked RNN showed superior performance in terms of Accuracy, Mean Squared Error (MSE), F1-Score, and Kappa Score.\n\nOverall, the evaluation methods ensured a comprehensive assessment of the proposed techniques, highlighting their effectiveness and superiority in handling imbalanced datasets and improving prediction accuracy in healthcare applications.",
  "evaluation/measure": "In our evaluation, we reported several performance metrics to comprehensively assess the effectiveness of our proposed models. These metrics include accuracy, mean squared error (MSE), F1-score, and Kappa score. Accuracy measures the proportion of correctly predicted instances out of the total instances. MSE quantifies the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values, providing insight into the model's prediction error. The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, offering a balanced measure of a model's performance, especially useful for imbalanced datasets. The Kappa score evaluates the agreement between predicted and actual classifications, adjusting for the possibility of chance agreement.\n\nAdditionally, we considered other metrics such as precision, recall, sensitivity, specificity, error rate, and the ROC curve. Precision indicates the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions, while recall (or sensitivity) measures the proportion of true positives correctly identified out of all actual positives. Specificity assesses the proportion of true negatives correctly identified out of all actual negatives. The error rate represents the proportion of incorrect predictions. The ROC curve plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate at various threshold settings, providing a visual representation of the model's diagnostic ability.\n\nThese metrics are widely used in the literature and are representative of standard evaluation practices in machine learning and data science. They provide a holistic view of model performance, covering aspects of correctness, error, and classification quality. By reporting these metrics, we aim to offer a thorough evaluation that can be compared with other studies in the field.",
  "evaluation/comparison": "In our evaluation, we conducted a comprehensive comparison of our proposed methods with both publicly available methods and simpler baselines to ensure robustness and validity. For the breast cancer dataset, we compared our Stacked CNN model with individual classifiers such as Na\u00efve Bayes, Decision Tree, SVM, and Neural Networks. The results, depicted in a comparative figure, showed that our Stacked CNN model achieved significantly higher accuracy, around 96\u201397%, compared to the 83\u201387% accuracy of the other methods. This demonstrates the superior performance of our approach in handling complex datasets.\n\nAdditionally, we evaluated our Stacked RNN model using COVID-19 data for time-series forecasting. We compared it with state-of-the-art models like Simple RNN, LSTM, and a combination of RNN and LSTM. The evaluation metrics, including accuracy, Mean Squared Error (MSE), F1-score, and Kappa score, clearly indicated that our Stacked RNN model outperformed the other classifiers. For instance, the Stacked RNN achieved an accuracy of 97%, which is substantially higher than the 89% accuracy of the RNN + LSTM model and the 84% accuracy of the LSTM model.\n\nWe also explored ensemble methods such as Voting, Bagging, Boosting, Random Forest, and Stacking. The stacking ensemble method, which combines multiple classifiers, provided the highest accuracy of 97%. This was compared to individual classifiers like Neural Networks, which had the lowest accuracy of 69%, and Decision Tree and Naive Bayes classifiers, which yielded approximately the same accuracy of 94%. The stacking approach showed a synergistic effect, augmenting the accuracy and demonstrating its potential for more accurate predictions in healthcare applications.\n\nFurthermore, we addressed the issue of class imbalance in datasets using oversampling techniques. We proposed two new approaches, Distance-based SMOTE (D-SMOTE) and Bi-phasic SMOTE (BP-SMOTE), and evaluated them with various classifiers like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Boosting, and Random Forest. The results showed that the Random Forest classifier, when combined with BP-SMOTE, yielded the highest accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curve values. This comparison highlighted the effectiveness of our proposed sampling techniques in improving the performance of classifiers on imbalanced datasets.\n\nIn summary, our methods were rigorously compared with publicly available methods and simpler baselines, demonstrating superior performance across various datasets and evaluation metrics. This comprehensive evaluation underscores the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed approaches in healthcare applications.",
