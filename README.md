# DOME Copilot Data Analysis

This repository contains the code, data pipelines, and analytical tools for the **DOME Copilot** project. This research focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automating the curation of machine learning experiment metadata from scientific publications, specifically using the **DOME Registry** schema.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The project is structured around validating an AI-assisted curation workflow ("Copilot") against human expert annotation. Key components include:

1.  **DOME Registry Analysis**: Processing a subset of 222 articles from the DOME Registry.
2.  **Large Scale Evaluation**: Analysis of a broader "Positive" dataset (1012 articles) and a corresponding "Negative" control set.
3.  **Human vs. AI Comparison**: A dedicated interface and analysis suite for comparing human and Copilot evaluations on a 30-paper subset.
4.  **Panel Generation**: Automated generation of publication figures (e.g., Panel 3).

## 📁 Project Structure

The repository is organized into modular components, each with its own specific README:

### Data Pipelines (Reference & Validation)
*   **[Download_222_DOME_Registry_PMC_Full_Text_and_Supplementary](Download_222_DOME_Registry_PMC_Full_Text_and_Supplementary/)**: 
    pipeline for the 222-article subset from the DOME Registry. Serves as a "Source Truth" benchmark.
*   **[Download_1012_Positive_PMC_Full_Text_and_Supplementary](Download_1012_Positive_PMC_Full_Text_and_Supplementary/)**: 
    Pipeline for downloading the 1012 "Positive" dataset (ML-relevant articles).
*   **[Download_1012_Negative_PMC_Full_Text_and_Supplementary](Download_1012_Negative_PMC_Full_Text_and_Supplementary/)**: 
    Pipeline for downloading the 1012 "Negative" dataset (Non-ML articles).

### Analysis & Evaluation
*   **[Copilot_Processed_Datasets_JSON](Copilot_Processed_Datasets_JSON/)**: 
    Contains the structured JSON metadata generated by the Copilot for both the 222 and 1012 datasets.
*   **[Human_30_Copilot_vs_Human_Evaluations_Interface](Human_30_Copilot_vs_Human_Evaluations_Interface/)**: 
    Tools and data for the comparative analysis of 30 papers (Human vs Copilot).
*   **[Publication_Figures](Publication_Figures/)**: 
    Notebooks for generating analytical plots for the final publication.

### Utilities
*   **[DOI_to_Metadata_Tool](DOI_to_Metadata_Tool/)**: 
    Script for retrieving metadata from Europe PMC using DOIs.
*   **[DOME_TSV_JSON_Converter_Tool](DOME_TSV_JSON_Converter_Tool/)**: 
    Utility for converting between DOME Registry's TSV and JSON formats.

## 💾 Data Availability (Zenodo)

Due to size comparisons and copyright restrictions, the full text PDFs and supplementary material archives are **not** hosted in this repository.

Upon publication, the following datasets will be available on **Zenodo**:

*   **[Zenodo Link Placeholder]**: 1012 Positive PMC Full Text & Supplementary
*   **[Zenodo Link Placeholder]**: 1012 Negative PMC Full Text & Supplementary
*   **[Zenodo Link Placeholder]**: 222 DOME Registry PMC Full Text & Supplementary

The pipelines in this repository are capable of re-downloading these materials from open-access sources (PMC/Europe PMC) given the provided ID lists.

## 🚀 Usage

Detailed usage instructions are provided within each sub-directory's README.

**General Workflow:**
1.  **Data Collection**: Run the `Download_*` scripts.
2.  **Processing**: (External Copilot step generates JSONs in `Copilot_Processed_Datasets_JSON`).
3.  **Validation**: Use `Human_30_Copilot_vs_Human_Evaluations_Interface` to compare results.
4.  **Analysis**: Run notebooks in `Publication_Figures` to generate charts.

## 🔬 Research Context

This code supports ongoing doctoral research into the reproducibility of machine learning experiments and the potential for automated metadata extraction to assist the DOME (Data, Optimization, Model, Evaluation) Registry initiative.
